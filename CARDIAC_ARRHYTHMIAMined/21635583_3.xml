<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of long-term treatment with flecainide in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), particularly with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) and proarrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single-centre study at Örebro University Hospital, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects.  A total of 112 patients with paroxysmal (51%) or persistent (49%) AF (mean age 60 ± 11 years) were included after identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with AF who initiated oral flecainide treatment (mean dose 203 ± 43 mg per day) between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard exclusion/inclusion criteria for flecainide were used, and flecainide treatment was usually combined with an atrioventricular-blocking agent (89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was classified as sudden or nonsudden according to standard definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proarrhythmia was defined as cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported during a mean follow-up of 3.4 ± 2.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the general population, the standardized mortality ratios were 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-3.09) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and 4.16 (95% CI 1.53-9.06) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were classified as SCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proarrhythmic events occurred in six patients (two each with wide QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, 1 : 1 conducted <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> during exercise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found an increased incidence of SCD or proarrhythmic events in this real-world study of flecainide used for the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that further investigation into the safety of flecainide for the treatment of patients with AF is warranted </plain></SENT>
