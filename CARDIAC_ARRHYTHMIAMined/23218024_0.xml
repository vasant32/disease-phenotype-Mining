<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although current left ventricular assist device (LVAD) technology has proven more durable than first-generation devices, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mechanical devices are prone to complications that can elevate patient acuity before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LVAD patients with complications intuitively carry a higher risk profile than other status 1A LVAD patients who are generally stable and use their 30 days of clinically stable status 1A time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if the presence or absence of complications in status 1A LVAD patients at the time of transplant influenced survival after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The United Network of Organ Sharing database was retrospectively analyzed for 15,253 patients who were listed status 1A from 1998 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival after transplant survival was compared between patients who were and were not listed for LVAD-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard statistical analysis was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No survival difference was identified at 1 and 10 years after transplant in patients who had device complications compared with those without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the five complication entries (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, malfunction, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and other), only device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> increased mortality risk compared with noncomplicated patients (39% at 1 year, 30% at 10 years, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes are generally not affected by the status 1A <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> criteria for patients bridged to transplant with LVADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the subset of patients with device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had worse 1-year and 10-year posttransplant survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bridge to transplant patients, despite serious device-related complications, still have excellent transplant outcomes </plain></SENT>
