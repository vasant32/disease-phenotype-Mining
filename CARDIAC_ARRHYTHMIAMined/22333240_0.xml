<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cost of managing defibrillator lead failures requires investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study of patients requiring lead replacement for defibrillator lead failure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Details pertaining to admissions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cost per lead replacement was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients {mean age [standard deviation (SD); range] = 56 (17; 18-83) years; 87% male} underwent lead replacement at a mean (SD; range) interval from implant of 3.0 (1.8; 0.9-9.0) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median (SD; range) length of hospital stay was 4.5 (8.6; 1-43) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications were recorded for three (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty days and 1-year mortality were 0 and 4% (1 of 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median (SD; range) cost per lead replacement was €7660 (€10 964; ��1472-39 663) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bed day costs accounted for 54% of overall costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extraction of the failed lead by manual traction at time of lead replacement did not significantly increase costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median (SD; range) cost of lead replacement was higher in patients receiving a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> generator (n= 6), compared with patients retaining existing generators (n= 17): €23 394 (€5026; €17 266-31 245) vs. €4470 (€9080; €1472-39 663); P= 0.005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median (SD; range) cost of lead replacement among patients who remained in hospital pending lead replacement (n= 16) was higher than for patients who underwent replacement on an emergent outpatient basis (n= 7): €8508 (€11 920; €1472-39 663) vs. €4372 (€7256; €1555-20 478); however, this observation was not statistically significant, P= 0.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Defibrillator lead failures incur significant cost and are likely to undermine overall cost effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness analyses of device therapy should include costs related to such complications </plain></SENT>
