<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the first 6 months after birth in the industrialized world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic contribution to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> has been investigated intensively and to date, 14 cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> genes have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newly published data from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Grand Opportunity (NHLBI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) provided important knowledge on genetic variation in the background population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variants previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> in ESP to improve the discrimination between plausible disease-causing mutations and variants most likely to be false-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PubMed database was searched to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> variants and the prevalence of these in the ESP population (6500 individuals) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In silico prediction tools were applied to variants present in ESP and 6 SIDS-associated variants (CAV3 p.C72W, p.T78M; KCNH2 p.R148W, and SCN5A p.S216L, p.V1951L, p.F2004L) were genotyped in our own control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen different missense variants previously associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> were identified in ESP affecting 225 of 6424 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to 1:29 individuals in the ESP population being carriers of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>-associated variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of 6Â <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>-associated variants in our own controls revealed frequencies comparable with those found in ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A very high prevalence of previously <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>-associated variants was identified in exome data from population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the suggested disease-causing role of some of these variants is questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A cautious interpretation of these variants must be made when found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> victims </plain></SENT>
