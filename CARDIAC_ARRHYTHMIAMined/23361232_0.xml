<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guided by theories of differential susceptibility and biological sensitivity to context, we evaluated whether high baseline respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) operates as a susceptibility factor among infants reared in poverty (N = 73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline RSA at 5 months, the quality of the attachment relationship at 17 months, and the interaction of these two factors were included in our models as predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behavior</z:e> at 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with theory, results showed no significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behavior</z:e> among infants with low baseline RSA; however, infants with high baseline RSA exhibited the lowest levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behavior</z:e> if reared in an environment that fostered security, and they exhibited the highest levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">problem behavior</z:e> if reared in an environment that fostered disorganization </plain></SENT>
