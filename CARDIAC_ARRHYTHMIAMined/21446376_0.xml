<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Trans-radial and trans-ulnar access is increasingly used for percutaneous coronary procedures, but spasm or pain may limit comfort and compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> administration could provide a <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anaesthetic</z:chebi> effect, but its risk-benefit ratio is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare intraarterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> versus saline to reduce peri-procedural discomfort during percutaneous trans-radial or trans-ulnar procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing percutaneous trans-radial or trans-ulnar coronary procedures were single-blinded randomly assigned to intra-arterial treatment with 20 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point of the study was local pain, measured on a 10-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 101 patients were enrolled (50 allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> and 51 to saline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trans-radial access was employed in 48 (96%) and 47 (92%), respectively, trans-ulnar access in 2 (4%) and 4 (8%), and coronary intervention was performed in 18(36%) and 11 (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of local pain was equivalent in both groups (2.3 +/- 2.3 vs. 3.0 +/- 2.5, P= 0.167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results for both groups were found also for local spasm, local access success, procedural success, and net clinical adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or neurologic symptom developed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Current approaches and techniques for percutaneous trans-radial or trans-ulnar coronary procedures are associated with few local or systemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local forearm/wrist pain is relatively frequent in this setting, and is not significantly prevented by intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
