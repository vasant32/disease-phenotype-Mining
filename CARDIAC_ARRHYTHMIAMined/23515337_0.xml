<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low AFR has been associated with favourable outcome of interventions in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AFR has never been studied in unselected patients with short duration of AF, prone to regain sinus rhythm (SR) spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess if AFR can predict spontaneous conversion in patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Files of consecutive patients with AF &lt; 48 h seeking emergency room care during a 12-month period were screened (n = 225) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with thyroid illness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, history of cardiac surgery or catheter ablation, or on class I/III antiarrhythmics were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrial fibrillatory rate was obtained by QRST cancellation and time frequency analysis of electrocardiogram at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 148 patients (age 64 Â± 13 years, 52 men), of whom 48 converted to SR within 18 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those converting spontaneously comprised more women, had a higher prevalence of first-ever AF episode, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, and a lower AFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis revealed: AFR &lt; 350 <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillations</z:mp> per minute [odds ratio (OR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-10.5, P = 0.016], <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.5-22.4, P = 0.012) and first-ever AF episode (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.3-13.0, P = 0.015) as independent predictors of spontaneous conversion.CONCLUSION: A low AFR was predictive of spontaneous conversion in patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Along with first-ever AF episode and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, AFR can be used in assessing likelihood of spontaneous conversion, if proven in prospective studies </plain></SENT>
