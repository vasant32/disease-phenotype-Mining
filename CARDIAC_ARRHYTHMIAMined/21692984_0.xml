<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> attenuated post-infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the involved mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether K(ATP) channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> can attenuate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through preserving protein kinase C (PKC)-(ε)dependent connexin43 level after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats after ligating coronary artery were randomized to either vehicle, nicorandil, pinacidil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or a combination of nicorandil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or pinacidil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the role of PKC(ε) in the modulation of connexin43 level, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> and myristoylated PKC(ε) V1-2 peptide were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myocardial connexin43 level was significantly decreased in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attenuated connexin43 level was blunted after administering K(ATP) channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, assessed by immunofluorescent analysis, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of connexin43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in the K(ATP) channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>-treated rats were significantly lower than those treated with vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of K(ATP) channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> were blocked by either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or 5-hydroxydecanoate </plain></SENT>
