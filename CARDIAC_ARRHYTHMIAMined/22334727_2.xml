<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Observational studies in selected populations have suggested that microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing may identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to investigate the utility of MTWA testing in an unselected population of patients with HF and to evaluate the clinical characteristics associated with the MTWA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1003 patients hospitalized with decompensated HF were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MTWA testing was planned 1 month post-discharge; 648 patients returned for MTWA testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 70.8 Â± 10.6 years and 58% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these patients who returned, 318 (49%) were ineligible for MTWA testing due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), pacemaker dependency, or physical inability to undertake the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the MTWA tests, 100 (30%) were positive, 78 (24%) were negative, and 152 (46%) were indeterminate; 112/152 indeterminate tests (74%) occurred because of failure to achieve target heart rate (HR) due to chronotropic incompetence or physical limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were differences in patient characteristics according to MTWA result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of a negative result included younger age and higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of a positive result included higher HR during MTWA testing and lower LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of an indeterminate result included older age and history of previous/paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Only half of patients with HF are eligible for MTWA testing and the most common result is an indeterminate test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive and indeterminate tests have different clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MTWA treadmill testing is not widely applicable in typical HF patients and is unlikely to refine risk stratification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> on a population level </plain></SENT>
