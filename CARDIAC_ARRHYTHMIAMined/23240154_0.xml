<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered in a dose of 20 mg/kg (i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Niferidil injections increased the refractory periods in both right and left atrium (by 22 and 20%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001), right ventricle (12%, p &lt; 0.01), and the His-Purkinje system (34%, p &lt; 0.001) and improved additional anterograde and retrograde conduction (by 22 and 31%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001), while not influencing the conduction via excitable cardiac tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elongation of the QTc interval (22%, p &lt;0.05) in one case was accompanied by an arrythmogenic effect (induction of short-term polymorphous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> of the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo>" type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Niferidil arrested PSVT in 78% cases and prevented PSVT development in response to endocardial stimulation in 86% of patients </plain></SENT>
