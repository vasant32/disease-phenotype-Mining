<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term risk for validated symptomatic cardiac events (CEs) and associated risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> survivors (CCSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We determined CEs grade 3 or higher: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>), <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>, valvular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo> (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0) in a hospital-based cohort of 1,362 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1966 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated both marginal and cause-specific cumulative incidence of CEs and cause-specific cumulative incidence of separate events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed different risk factors in multivariable Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 50 CEs, including 27 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, were observed in 42 survivors (at a median attained age of 27.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-year cause-specific cumulative incidence of CEs was significantly increased after treatment with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> and cardiac irradiation (12.6%; 95% CI, 4.3% to 20.3%), after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> (7.3%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 10.7%), and after cardiac irradiation (4.0%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 7.4%) compared with other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the proportional hazards analyses, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> (dose), cardiac irradiation (dose), combination of these treatments, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> were significantly associated with developing a CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated an exponential relationship between the cumulative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi> dose, cardiac irradiation dose, and risk of CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CCSs have a high risk of developing symptomatic CEs at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common CE was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survivors treated with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> and radiotherapy have the highest risk; after 30 years, one in eight will develop severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of potentially cardiotoxic treatments should be reconsidered for high-risk groups, and frequent follow-up for high-risk survivors is needed </plain></SENT>
