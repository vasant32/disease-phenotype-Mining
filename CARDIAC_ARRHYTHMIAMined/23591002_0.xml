<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore its efficacy and mechanism, we have studied the electroacupuncture (EA) inhibition on experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rabbits since 1980s and analyzed its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies were mostly conducted in the Department of <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp>, Shanghai Medical University; recently the mechanism of acupuncture's effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was analyzed in the School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, which involves the following: (1)the inhibitory effect of EA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> can be induced by hypothalamic defense area stimulation: a low-current and low-frequency stimulation of the median nerve underneath acupoints P 5 or deep peroneal nerve underneath S 36 can activate arcuate nucleus-ventral periaqueductal gray -nuclei raphe pathway and release endorphin, enkephaline, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>), 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>), etc., thus inhibiting the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM), decreasing sympathetic outflow, and alleviating <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo>; (2) the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> induced by stimulation of aortic depressor nerve can be blocked by stimulation of superficial radial nerve (underneath LI 6-7) or superficial peroneal nerve (underneath G37-39): these stimulations activate the rVLM release opioids and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> to inhibit nucleus tractus solitarius and vagal nuclei, and block vagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These experimental data explore the mechanism of acupuncture's effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and are useful for clinical application </plain></SENT>
