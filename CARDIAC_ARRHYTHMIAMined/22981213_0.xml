<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of cocaine in Australia has risen steadily since the late 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>What remains unclear in the literature is whether cocaine-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> can occur in the absence of other contributing factors, such as concomitant drug use or natural disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A search was conducted on the National Coroners Information System database, to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring in Victoria, Australia, between January 2000 and December 2011, where cocaine or its metabolites were detected by post-mortem toxicological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were closed by the Coroner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases were examined with regards to case circumstances, pathology and toxicology results, and coronial findings, to determine the prevalence of cardiotoxicity and the involvement of cocaine in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> compared with other contributing factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 49 cases where cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi>, methylecgonine or cocaethylene, were detected in the 11-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The individuals ranged in age from 16 to 70 years (median 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 36 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 22 cases the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined to be drug toxicity, 22 were external injury and 5 were attributed to natural disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concentration of cocaine in the cases was relatively low (range 0.01-3mg/L, median 0.1mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cocaine metabolites were detected frequently in blood and urine: benzoylecgonine (46 cases); ecgonine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (12 cases); cocaethylene (8 cases); and methylecgonine (9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Opioids were commonly detected (23 cases), in addition to <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi> (15 cases), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> (17 cases) and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> (12 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 43 cases receiving a full autopsy, there were 14 cases involving significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (11 cases), an <z:mp ids='MP_0000274'>enlarged heart</z:mp> (5 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> and contraction band <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cocaine is detected relatively infrequently in Victorian coronial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However it appears to be associated with a significant degree of cardiotoxicity, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, independent of cocaine concentration </plain></SENT>
