<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was induced in the electrically isolated left inferior pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the routine induction protocol, perimitral flutter was induced, whereas, independently, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was still maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After ablation of the mitral isthmus, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> were inducible anymore </plain></SENT>
