<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening of SCN5A-the gene encoding the α-subunit of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-has indicated that disturbances of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current may play a central role in the mechanism of lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that lone AF in young patients is associated with genetic mutations in SCN3B and SCN4B, the genes encoding the two β-subunits of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 192 unrelated lone AF patients, the entire coding sequence and splice junctions of SCN3B and SCN4B were bidirectionally sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three non-synonymous mutations were found in SCN3B (R6K, L10P, and M161T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two mutations were novel (R6K and M161T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the mutations were present in the control group (n = 432 alleles), nor have any been previously reported in conjunction with AF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological studies on the SCN3B mutation were carried out and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three SCN3B mutations caused a functionally reduced <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One synonymous variant was found in SCN4B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In 192 young lone AF patients, we found three patients with suspected disease-causing non-synonymous mutations in SCN3B, indicating that mutations in this gene contribute to the mechanism of lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three mutations in SCN3B were investigated electrophysiologically and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> led to loss of function in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, supporting the hypothesis that decreased <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current enhances AF susceptibility </plain></SENT>
