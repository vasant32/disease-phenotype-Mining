<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One of the safety concerns when performing electrophysiological (EP) procedures under magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) guidance is the risk of passive tissue heating due to the EP catheter being exposed to the radiofrequency (RF) field of the RF transmitting body coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation procedures that use catheters with irrigated tips are well established therapeutic options for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and when used in a modified mode might offer an additional system for suppressing passive catheter heating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A two-step approach was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Firstly, tests on passive catheter heating were performed in a 1.5 T Avanto system (Siemens Healthcare Sector, Erlangen, Germany) using a ASTM Phantom in order to determine a possible maximum temperature rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, a phantom was designed for simulation of the interface between blood and the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-RF induced temperature rise was simulated by catheter tip heating via a standard ablation generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Power levels from 1 to 6 W were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation duration was 120 s with no tip irrigation during the first 60 s and irrigation at rates from 2 ml/min to 35 ml/min for the remaining 60 s (Biotronik Qiona Pump, Berlin, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The temperature was measured with fluoroscopic sensors (Luxtron, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) at a distance of 0 mm, 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm from the catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A maximum temperature rise of 22.4째C at the catheter tip was documented in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This temperature rise is equivalent to the heating effect of an ablator's power output of 6 W at a contact force of the weight of 90 g (0.883 N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The catheter tip irrigation was able to limit the temperature rise to less than 2째C for the majority of examined power levels, and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined power levels the residual temperature rise was less than 8째C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Up to a maximum of 22.4째C, the temperature rise at the tissue surface can be entirely suppressed by using the catheter's own irrigation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The irrigated tip system can be used to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> safety of EP catheters by suppressing the effects of unwanted passive catheter heating due to RF exposure from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scanner </plain></SENT>
