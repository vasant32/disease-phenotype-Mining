<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most important properties of the optimal echocardiographic contrast agent are good contrast imaging and sufficient stability without fast washing out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HOCM was diagnosed in a 49-year-old female patient 4 years before first admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite optimal medical treatment the patient was highly symptomatic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> and dyspnoea NYHA II-III.Investigations, treatment and course: ECG showed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001670'>asymmetric septal hypertrophy</z:hpo>, dynamic LVOT obstruction with pronounced <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> and associated moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography performed in the catheterization laboratory showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and haemodynamic measurements verified a significant LVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An atypical septal branch, originating from the intermediate artery, was regarded as target branch and was occluded with a balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the contrast echocardiography guided septal ablation cold, agitated Gelafundin® was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This led to a good subaortic septal contrast demarcation with confirmation of the correct choice of target branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded during the administration of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injection of Levovist® in the same septal branch for comparison resulted in opacification of the same myocardial area without any sign of misplacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After alcohol injection in the balloon-occluded septal branch, an effective elimination of the LVOT gradient could be haemodynamically documented.Conclusion: For contrast echocardiography guided PTSMA a good myocardial opacification with an appropriate contrast agent is essential, not only to recognize the obstruction dependent region but also to identify any possible misplacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Gelafundin® seems to offer similarly sufficient contrast potential as Levovist®, so that Gelafundin® could be a possible alternative </plain></SENT>
