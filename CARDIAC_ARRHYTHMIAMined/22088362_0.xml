<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to investigate the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> by Ewing's classification on functional outcome 2 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 34 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, autonomic function was assessed by Ewing's battery tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was assessed by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), autonomy in activities of daily living by the Barthel Index (BI), and global disability by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BI and mRS were also evaluated 2 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, eight patients were diagnosed as minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> and 26 patients as relatively severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of relatively severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients was 76.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the minor and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the mean BI score of patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> increased from 76.3±15.3 on admission to 95.0±7.1, 66.5±15.2 on admission to 74.8±15.9 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean BI score after 2-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the change in BI from admission to 2-month outcome (delta BI) in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> were lower than those in patients with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Relatively severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> is related to an unfavorable functional outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
