<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the mechanisms, we evaluated the cardiac structural and electrophysiological changes in mice chronically drinking excessive alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Male C57BL/6J mice were given 36% alcohol in the drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those given blank water were used as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve weeks later, the phenotypic characteristics of the heart, including gap junctions and electrical properties were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the alcohol group the ventricles contained a smaller size of cardiomyocytes and a higher density of capillary networks, compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots showed that, after drinking alcohol, the content of connexin43 (Cx43) protein in the left ventricle was increased by 18% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, immunoconfocal microscopy demonstrated that Cx43 gap junctions were up-regulated in the alcohol group with a disorganized distribution, compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping showed that the alcohol group had a reduced conduction velocity (40 ± 18 vs 60 ± 7 cm/sec, p &lt; 0.05) and a higher incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (62% vs 30%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term excessive alcohol intake resulted in extensive cardiac remodeling, including changes in expression and distribution of gap junctions, growth of capillary network, reduction of cardiomyocyte size, and decrease of myocardial conduction </plain></SENT>
