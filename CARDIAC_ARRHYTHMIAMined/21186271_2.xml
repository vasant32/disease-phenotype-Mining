<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We sought to explore the distribution pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels across ventricular wall, and to determine its functional correlates, in the guinea pig heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel (Na(v)) protein expression levels were measured in transmural samples of ventricular tissue by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated, perfused heart preparations were used to record monophasic action potentials and volume-conducted ECG, and to measure effective refractory periods (ERPs) and pacing thresholds, in order to assess excitability, electrical restitution kinetics, and susceptibility to stimulation-evoked tachyarrhythmias at epicardial and endocardial stimulation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both ventricular chambers, Na(v) protein expression was higher at endocardium than epicardium, with midmyocardial layers showing intermediate expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endocardial stimulation sites showed higher excitability, as evidenced by lower pacing thresholds during regular stimulation and downward displacement of the strength-interval curve reconstructed after extrasystolic stimulation compared with epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ERP restitution assessed over a wide range of pacing rates showed greater maximal slope and faster kinetics at endocardial than epicardial stimulation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flecainide, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel blocker, reduced the maximal ERP restitution slope, slowed restitution kinetics, and eliminated epicardial-to-endocardial difference in dynamics of electrical restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater excitability and steeper electrical restitution have been associated with greater arrhythmic susceptibility of endocardium than epicardium, as assessed by measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold, inducibility of tachyarrhythmias by rapid cardiac pacing, and the magnitude of stimulation-evoked repolarization alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel expression levels may contribute to greater excitability, steeper electrical restitution slopes and faster restitution kinetics, and greater susceptibility to stimulation-evoked tachyarrhythmias at endocardium than epicardium in the guinea pig heart </plain></SENT>
