<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMR) for SCD risk stratification has been evaluated in several studies, small sample size has limited their clinical validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed this meta-analysis to better gauge the predictive accuracy of LGE-CMR for SCD risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases and published bibliographies were systematically searched to identify studies evaluating the association between the extent of LV scar on LGE-CMR and ventricular arrhythmic events [SCD, resuscitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only studies enrolling patients with CAD or non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary estimates of the relative risk (RR) and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven studies comprising 1105 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a mean/median follow-up of 8.5-41 months 207 patients had ventricular arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ventricular arrhythmic events were more common in patients with a greater extent of LV scar: RR 4.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98-6.29], positive LR 1.98 (95% CI 1.66-2.37), and negative LR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24-0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The extent of LGE on CMR is strongly associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with reduced LVEF and may be a valuable risk stratification tool for identifying patients who will benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, uncertainties regarding clinical application persist and need to be addressed prior to introduction into broad clinical practice </plain></SENT>
