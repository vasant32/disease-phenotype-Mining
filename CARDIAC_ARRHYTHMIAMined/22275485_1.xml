<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of selective endocardial autonomic denervation in left atrium (LA) as an alternative treatment strategy in patients with highly symptomatic VVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 50.4±6.4 years; 7 women) with a medium of 3.5 (range, 2-20) recurrent episodes of VVS during the preceding year and positive head-up tilt testing in whom standard therapies were ineffective or poorly tolerated were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ganglionated plexi (GP) in the LA, identified by high-frequency stimulation, was targeted by radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were then followed up at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, including repeated head-up tilt testing and Holter at 3 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency energy was applied at the left superior GP in 10 patients, right anterior GP in 5, and left inferior GP in 3, using an 8-mm ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vagal response, defined as transient ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, or an increase in R-R interval by 50%, was observed during ablation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GP sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The end point of procedure was the inhibition of the vagal response at target sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 30±16 (range, 13-55) months of follow-up, no patient had any recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had significant improvement in symptoms, but 5 of 10 patients reported transient prodromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive endocardial autonomic denervation of the LA demonstrates the feasibility of treating VVS in medium-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
