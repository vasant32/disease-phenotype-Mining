<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to be activated by oxidation, but whether and how CaMKII links <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> to pathophysiological long-term changes in Ca(2+) signaling remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present evidence demonstrating the role of CaMKII in transient <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced long-term facilitation (LTF) of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) in rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 5-min exposure of 1mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> induced an increase in I(Ca,L), and this increase was sustained for ~1h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 fully reversed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced LTF of I(Ca,L), indicating that sustained CaMKII activity underlies this <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous inhibition of oxidation and autophosphorylation of CaMKII prevented the maintenance of LTF, suggesting that both mechanisms contribute to sustained CaMKII activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further found that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS generation have critical roles in sustaining CaMKII activity via autophosphorylation- and oxidation-dependent mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that long-term remodeling of the cardiac action potential is induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> via CaMKII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CaMKII and mitochondria confer <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced pathological cellular memory that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
