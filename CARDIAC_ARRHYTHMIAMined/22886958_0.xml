<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II inhibitor, KN-93, on L-type calcium current (I(Ca, L)) and early after-depolarizations (EADs) in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A rabbit model of <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> was constructed through abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> (LVH group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group (sham group) received a sham operation, in which the abdominal aortic was dissected but not coarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks later, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) was evaluated using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual cardiomyocyte was isolated through collagenase digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Action potentials (APs) and I(Ca, L) were recorded using the perforated patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APs were recorded under current clamp conditions and I(Ca, L) was recorded under voltage clamp conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EADs and I(ca, L) in the hypertrophic cardiomyocytes were observed under the conditions of low <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (2 mmol/L), low <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (0.25 mmol/L) Tyrode's solution perfusion, and slow frequency (0.25-0.5 Hz) electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of EADs and I(ca, L) in the hypertrophic cardiomyocytes were also evaluated after treatment with different concentrations of KN-92 (KN-92 group) and KN-93 (KN-93 group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight weeks later, the model was successfully established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions of low <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, low <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> Tyrode's solution perfusion, and slow frequency electrical stimulation, the incidence of EADs was 0/12, 11/12, 10/12, and 5/12 in sham group, LVH group, KN-92 group (0.5 μmol/L), and KN-93 group (0.5 μmol/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the drug concentration was increased to 1 μmol/L in KN-92 group and KN-93 group, the incidence of EADs was 10/12 and 2/12, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 0 mV, the current density was 6.7±1.0 and 6.3±0.7 PA��PF(-1) in LVH group and sham group, respectively (P&gt;0.05, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When the drug concentration was 0.5 μmol/L in KN-92 and KN-93 groups, the peak I(Ca, L) at 0 mV was decreased by (9.4±2.8)% and (10.5±3.0)% in the hypertrophic cardiomyocytes of the two groups, respectively (P&gt;0.05, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When the drug concentration was increased to 1 μmol/L, the peak I(Ca, L) values were lowered by (13.4±3.7)% and (40±4.9)%, respectively (P&lt;0.01, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>KN-93, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII, can effectively inhibit the occurrence of EADs in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes partially by suppressing I(Ca, L), which may be the main action mechanism of KN-93 antagonizing the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in hypertrophic myocardium </plain></SENT>
