<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during bariatric surgery have not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old, severely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, diabetic woman with no other prior medical history underwent thorough preoperative cardiovascular evaluation before having laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperatively she developed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> during the use of unipolar electrocautery near the Angle of His </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was aborted, and the patient underwent repeat cardiovascular assessment including coronary angiography and serial electrophysiology studies before being unremarkably re-operated 6 months later, at which time a harmonic scalpel was used for dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12 months post operation, the patient remains asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Owing to the proximity of the right ventricle overlying the diaphragm, far-field stimulation was likely responsible for inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
