<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one centre-members of European Heart Rhythm Association Research network have responded to the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the obtained data, 55.2% of responding centres do not perform MRI scans in patients with non-MRI-certified pacemakers and 65.8% in patients with such implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reported complication rate in patients with non-MRI-certified devices is low and conforms to the literature data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experience with newer MRI-compatible pacemakers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> is limited to single cases in most centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This survey shows limited experience with performing MRI studies in patients with implanted pacemakers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In concordance with available guidelines, most centres limit MRI scans in patients with non-MRI-certified devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The implant numbers for MRI-certified devices and experience with performing MRI scans in these patients are still low </plain></SENT>
