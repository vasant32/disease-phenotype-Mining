<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 117 consecutive patients presenting with paroxysmal (n = 92) or persistent (n = 25) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), who underwent attempts at isolation of 442 PV with a cryoballoon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were followed in our ambulatory department for every 3 months, or earlier if they reported symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 48 h ambulatory electrocardiogram was recorded at the 3-month visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed the immediate and long-term procedural and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We isolated 385 of 442 PV (87%) with a single cryoballoon application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients (16%), an irrigated-tip radiofrequency (RF) catheter was used to create a supplemental focal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A median of nine applications per procedure (range 6-12) was delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean, overall procedural duration was 155 ± 43 min (range 75-275), and mean duration of fluoroscopic exposure was 35 ± 15 min (range 12-73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of the procedure, 103 patients (88%) were in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over a median period of 9.6 months (range 3-12), 11 patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, respectively, 79, 79, 79, and 69% of patients presenting with paroxysmal AF had remained recurrence free, vs. 83, 73, 59, and 45% of patients, respectively, with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1442879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Phrenic nerve palsy</z:e> was the most frequent, although reversible complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein isolation, using a cryoballoon catheter, was completed with a high rate of procedural and long-term success and low rate of minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Supplemented, when needed, by focal RF, cryoballoon ablation was a safe and an effective alternative to a circumferential RF procedure </plain></SENT>
