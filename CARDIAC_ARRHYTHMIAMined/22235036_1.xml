<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillatory rate (AFR) is a measure of atrial remodeling caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and its acceleration negatively affects outcome of interventions for persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic value of AFR in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate whether AFR can predict outcome in patients with mild to moderate (New York Health Association II-III) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: High-resolution 20-minute long Holter ECGs obtained from 169 CHF patients with AF at enrollment were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AFR was estimated using spatiotemporal QRST cancellation and time-frequency analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for a median of 44 months, with primary end point defined as total mortality and secondary end points as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial signal quality was sufficient for AFR estimation in 142 patients (mean age 69±11 years, 101 male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, 48 patients died during follow-up, including 18 because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean AFR was 390±60 fpm and decreased with age (r=-0.3, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with AFR ≤371 fpm (lower tertile) had 44% 3-year mortality as compared with 26% with higher AFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower AFR was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality (HR=1.99, 95% CI=1.09-3.63, P=0.025) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR=3.74, 95% CI=1.38-10.14, P=0.010) after adjustment for significant clinical covariates in multivariable Cox analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients with AF, reduced AFR assessed using noninvasive approach is associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> progression, and may be considered a predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
