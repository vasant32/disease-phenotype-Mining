<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) enlargement has been documented to occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT), and has been an index for evaluating the diastolic function of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enlargement of the LA is one of the vital factors that induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients with HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND SUBJECTS: 130 treated hypertensive patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> recruits participated in an echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, a routine blood examination including brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP), and physical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular mass (LVM) indexed to height(2.7) had a significant positive correlation with left atrial volume index (LAVI) (p&lt;0.0001), as well as natural logarithm BNP (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure levels were not associated with LAVI, neither body mass index nor age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LAVI had a positive correlation with factors involving the left ventricle volume, LVM, and right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) (r=0.687, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The parameters of LV diastolic function were positively but weakly associated with LA size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of LAVI, the evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF): LAVI&lt;32 ml/m(2) had no PAF, whereas the incidence of PAF was 7.5%, 11.4%, and 15.2%, respectively in the LAVI&gt;32 ml/m(2) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and angiotensin receptor blockers had a tendency to reduce LAVI; however, there was no statistical significance within the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular volume and mass are independent factors affecting LAVI in treated HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PAF is associated with LA size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with treated HT, LA size may be a useful surrogate marker for monitoring the effectiveness of medical therapy and occurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
