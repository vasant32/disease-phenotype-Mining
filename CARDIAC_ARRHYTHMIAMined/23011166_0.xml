<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the exact prevention mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study tested the hypothesis that the kappa OR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> U50,488H mediates the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> through the regulation of intracellular calcium leading to the preservation of Cx43 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By performing electrocardiogram monitoring and immunoblotting in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, high concentrations of calcium-perfused rat hearts exhibited increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diminished expression of Cx43 protein was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The utilization of a whole-cell patch clamp technique revealed that U50,488H inhibited L-type calcium current in single ventricular myocytes in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were blocked by nor-binaltorphimine, potent and selective κ-OR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of U50,488H before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> resulted in an attenuated of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The attenuation effect was blocked by nor-binaltorphimine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The attenuation effect was antagonized both by Bay K8644, a L-type calcium channel <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, and also by the Cx43 uncoupler heptanol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, immunoblotting data demonstrated that the preservation of Cx43 protein conferred by U50,488H was reversed in the presence of Bay K8644 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, the present study demonstrates κ-OR activation with U50,488H may confer antiarrhythmic effects via modulation of the calcium-Cx43 pathway </plain></SENT>
