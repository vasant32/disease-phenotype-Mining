<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, affecting patients even in the early stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impairment of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in this disease has been recognized, as well as its potential as a trigger for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> when associated with structural or metabolic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify, in Chagas patients with preserved systolic function, the impairment of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and its association with functionally active anti-m2 and anti-β1 receptor antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using spectral analysis of RR variability during passive tilt test, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic patients were compared with healthy controls matched for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> with functionally active antibodies with anti-m2 and anti-β1 action was investigated by the Langendorf method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> without ventricular dysfunction express parasympathetic activity against a vagal stimulus, however with less intensity compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chagasic patients with anti-m2 or anti-β1 antibodies showed a further significant reduction of the vagal response during respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, regardless of the presence of structural lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the association of both factors promoted response to vagal stimulation similar to that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> without their presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lower vagal reserve in Chagas patients with preserved function was associated with functionally active anti-m2 or anti-β1 antibodies, and not with the presence of structural heart lesion </plain></SENT>
