<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to determine seasonal and circadian cardiac events in patients with a congenital LQTS genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The medical records of 196 consecutive patients with symptomatic LQTS (age, 32 ± 19 years; female, n=133; LQT1, n=86; LQT2, n=95; LQT3, n=15) who were genotyped between 1979 and 2006 at 2 major Japanese institutions were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 developed 223,550 and 59 cardiac events during a mean follow-up of 26, 33, and 25 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of cardiac events significantly peaked during the summer among those with LQT1 (P&lt;0.001) and from summer to fall in those with LQT2 (P&lt;0.001), but reached the nadir in winter among those with LQT3 (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac events significantly peaked in the afternoon (12:00-17:59) and morning (06:00-11:59) among those with LQT1 (P&lt;0.001) and LQT2 (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of cardiac events was specifically seasonal and circadian among patients with the 3 major genotypes of congenital LQTS.  </plain></SENT>
