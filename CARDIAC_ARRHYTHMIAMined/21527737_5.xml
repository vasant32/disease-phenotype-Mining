<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Posttranslational phosphorylation of connexin43 (Cx43) has been proposed as a key regulatory event in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac gap junction expression and pathological gap junction remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the role of Cx43 phosphorylation in the context of the intact organism is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish whether specific Cx43 phosphorylation events influence gap junction expression and pathological remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated Cx43 germline knock-in mice in which serines 325/328/330 were replaced with phosphomimetic glutamic acids (S3E) or nonphosphorylatable alanines (S3A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The S3E mice were resistant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pathological gap junction remodeling and displayed diminished susceptibility to the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the S3A mice showed deleterious effects on cardiac gap junction formation and function, developed electric remodeling, and were highly susceptible to inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a mechanistic link between posttranslational phosphorylation of Cx43 and gap junction formation, remodeling, and arrhythmic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
