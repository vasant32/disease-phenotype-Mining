<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, subtle electrophysiological differences between species may lead to different rhythmic or arrhythmic cellular behaviors and drug response given the nonlinear and highly interactive cellular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using detailed and quantitatively accurate mathematical models for human, dog, and guinea pig ventricular action potentials (APs), we simulated and compared cell electrophysiology mechanisms and response to drugs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AP prolongation with reduction of rapid delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) and I(Ks) (due to mutations or drugs) showed strong species dependence in simulations, as in experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For humans, AP prolongation was 80% following I(Kr) block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was 30% for dog and 20% for guinea pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under basal conditions, I(Ks) block was of no consequence for human and dog, but for guinea pig, AP prolongation after I(Ks) block was severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, with β-adrenergic stimulation, I(Ks) played an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species, particularly in AP shortening at fast rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantitative comparison of AP repolarization, rate-dependence mechanisms, and drug response in human, dog, and guinea pig revealed major species differences (e.g., susceptibility to arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations) </plain></SENT>
