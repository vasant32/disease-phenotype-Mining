<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal pacing modality after AVJ ablation remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to examine whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is superior to right ventricular (RV) pacing in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies evaluating the effect of CRT vs. RV pacing after AVJ ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively, using a random effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five trials involving 686 patients (413 in CRT and 273 in RV pacing group) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the pooled estimate across the studies, CRT resulted in a non-significant reduction in mortality (RR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.43-1.30; P= 0.30) and a significant reduction in hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.17-0.85; P= 0.02) compared with RV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy did not improve 6 min walk distance (mean difference 15.7, 95% CI -7.2 to 38.5 m; P= 0.18) and Minnesota Living with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> quality-of-life score (mean difference -3.0, 95% CI -8.6 to 2.6; P= 0.30) compared with RV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in left ventricular ejection fraction between baseline and 6 months favoured CRT (mean change 2.0%, 95% CI 1.5-2.4%; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy may be superior to RV pacing in patients undergoing AVJ ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies, adequately powered to detect clinical outcomes, are required </plain></SENT>
