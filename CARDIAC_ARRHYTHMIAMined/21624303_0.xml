<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 each): control group, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> group and AAP10 + <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using arterially perfused rabbit ventricular wedge preparations, transmural ECG and action potentials from both endocardium and epicardium were simultaneously recorded in the whole process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments with two separate floating microeletrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> post S1S2 stimulation was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of nonphosphorylated Cx43 and total Cx43 were evaluated by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of nonphosphorylated Cx43 was observed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the QT interval, endocardial action potential duration, transmural repolarization dispersion (TDR) and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were significantly increased and nonphosphorylated Cx43 expression was significantly upregulated in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> group, cotreatment with AAP10 can reduce the QT interval, endocardial action potential duration, TDR and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (25.0% vs 62.5%, P &lt; 0.01) and downregulate nonphosphorylated Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> could promote the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> possibly by upregulating nonphosphorylated Cx43 and subsequent gap junction transmission inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gap junction enhancer AAP10 could attenuate the pro-arrhythmic effect of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> probably by downregulating myocardial nonphosphorylated Cx43 expression </plain></SENT>
