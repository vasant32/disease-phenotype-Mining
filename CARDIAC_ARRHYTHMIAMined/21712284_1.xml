<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these patients constitute a lower-risk population and might derive less benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, patients with CAD in whom an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was implanted for primary prevention were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies in two predefined LVEF cut-off groups (≤/&gt;20%; ≤/&gt;30%), predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies, and overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 536 patients were included: 88% male, age 63 ± 10 years, follow-up 30 ± 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 115 patients (22%) experienced appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions; in 36% of them, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was treated with shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate therapy was delivered in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative mortality at 5 years was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using our two cut-off levels, more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-therapies occurred in patients with poorer LVEF, but the difference was significant only with the cut-off value of ≤/&gt;20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 12 parameters were predictors of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy: age, odds ratio (OR) 1.047 (1.015-1.079) per year and QRS width, OR 1.014 per ms (1.004-1.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Refined risk stratification using different LVEF cut-off levels is not helpful in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality was lower than in randomized trials in this real-world setting, probably due to better drug treatment at implant </plain></SENT>
