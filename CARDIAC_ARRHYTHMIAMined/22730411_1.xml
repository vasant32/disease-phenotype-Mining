<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Beat-to-beat QT variability index (QTVI), log-transformed heart rate variance, normalized QT variance, and coherence between heart rate variability and QT variability have been measured at rest during sinus rhythm in 533 participants of the Muerte Subita en Insuficiencia Cardiaca <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> study (mean age, 63.1Â±11.7; men, 70.6%; left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;35% in 254 [48%]) and in 181 healthy participants from the Intercity Digital Electrocardiogram Alliance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a median of 3.7 years of follow-up, 116 patients died, 52 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariate competing risk analyses, the highest QTVI quartile was associated with cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (subhazard ratio, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.14-2.47]; P=0.009) and, in particular, with non-SCD (subhazard ratio, 2.91 [1.69-5.01]; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated QTVI separated 97.5% of healthy individuals from subjects at risk for cardiovascular (subhazard ratio, 1.57 [1.04-2.35]; P=0.031) and non-SCD in multivariate competing risk model (subhazard ratio, 2.58 [1.13-3.78]; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No interaction between QTVI and left ventricular ejection fraction was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QTVI predicted neither noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P=0.546) nor SCD (P=0.945) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003929'>Decreased heart rate variability</z:mp> rather than increased QT variability was the reason for increased QTVI in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased QTVI because of depressed heart rate variability predicts cardiovascular mortality and non-SCD but neither SCD nor extracardiac mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> across the continuum of left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormally augmented QTVI separates 97.5% of healthy individuals from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients at risk </plain></SENT>
