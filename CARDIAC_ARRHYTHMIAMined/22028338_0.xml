<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that EGFR is involved in regulating electrical excitability of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether EGFR activation would mediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by reperfusion in anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced by 10 min ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by a 30 min reperfusion in anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly reduced by pre-treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG556 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation level of myocardial EGFR was increased during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and at early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intramyocardial transfection of EGFR siRNA reduced EGFR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein, and decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> induced by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels (I(Na)) and L-type Ca(2+) channels (I(Ca,L)) were significantly increased at time points corresponding to the alteration of EGFR phosphorylation levels during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AG556 pre-treatment countered the increased tyrosine phosphorylation level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and L-type Ca(2+) channels induced by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp studies proved that AG556 could inhibit I(Na) and I(Ca,L) in rat ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant alteration was observed in tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cardiac Kv4.2 and Kir2.1 channels during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate for the first time that EGFR plays an important role in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by reperfusion, which is likely mediated at least in part by enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and L-type Ca(2+) channels </plain></SENT>
