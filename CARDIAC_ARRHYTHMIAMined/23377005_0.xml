<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presented algorithm adapts the general graph theoretical image segmentation algorithm and a histogram-based thresholding algorithm, which can measure many cardiac parameters, including heart rate, heart period, diastolic and systolic intervals, and end-diastolic and end-systolic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, dynamic cardiac functions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> index and percent fractional shortening, can be automatically calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the recorded heartbeats over significant periods of time </plain></SENT>
