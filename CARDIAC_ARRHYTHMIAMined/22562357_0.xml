<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described determinants of recurrence in subjects with a residual jump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed the data of subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> successful slow pathway cryoablation for AVNRT using a 6-mm-tip cryocatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as AVNRT non-inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with no baseline elicitable jump, no inducible AVNRT, and transient first atrioventricular (AV) block at the last site were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 371 patients who underwent cryoablation from May 2002 to March 2011, 303 fulfilled the entry criteria (mean age, 41 ± 16; 222 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline AV nodal effective refractory period (ERP) was 272 ± 57 ms, postprocedural 331 ± 64 (P &lt; 0.001), and the mean of the difference (Δ ERP) 60 ± 41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the procedure, 64 patients (21 %) had a residual jump, of whom 22 with a single echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months follow-up, the actuarial recurrence-free rate was 70.3 % in patients with a residual jump and 86 % in those without (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with a jump, only Δ AV nodal ERP was correlated with recurrence (37 ± 41 vs. 68 ± 47 ms; P &lt; 0.04) while a single echo was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial rate of recurrence was 60.8 % in patients with a Δ AV nodal ERP ≤ 30 ms and 18.8 % in those with a Δ AV nodal ERP &gt;30 ms (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of slow pathway conduction is the optimal endpoint for AVNRT cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A residual jump can be tolerated if AV nodal ERP postcryoablation is prolonged &gt;30 ms </plain></SENT>
