<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The annual incidence of out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> is around 90-190 cases per 100 000 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The limiting factor for further prognosis of patients after out-of-hospital arrest is their neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The S100B protein is mainly the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system cells product, its glial-specific and mostly expressed by astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> its increased level correlates with the prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Work aims to determine the level of protein S100B in the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and compare it to the value in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> after out-of-hospital resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 24 patients were evaluated after out-of-hospital resuscitation for the malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with mild therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 19 patients with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sample for the determination of S-100B was taken immediately on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurological status was evaluated according to the CPC scores (Cerebral Performance Categories) at discharge, patients were divided into 3 groups: CPC1 - good condition, CPC2 - moderate neurological disability, CPC3-5 - serious neurological impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The values of protein S-100B fluctuated, in patients with no resuscitation, in range between 0.038 to 0.204 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients after resuscitation without subsequent neurological disability (CPC 1) was range 0.077 to 0.817 pg/ml, in patients with moderate to severe neurological disability (CPC 2) was range 0.132-2.59 pg/ml, patients with severe neurological disabilities or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> had S-100B levels from 0.70 to 8.53 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to ROC analysis we found the cut-off value for the S-100B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cut-off value for probably a good neurological condition is &lt; 0.23 pg/ml (specificity 93%, sensitivity 70%), and value testify for supposed severe neurological disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is &gt; 1.64 pg/ml (specificity 95%, sensitivity 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Protein S-100B is one of the early and sensitive markers of severe brain damage in patients after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Its early determination can help in prediction of patient neurological condition and help doctors to decide further action </plain></SENT>
