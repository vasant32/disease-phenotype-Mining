<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prospective randomized single-centre study 'Mesh Ablator versus Cryoballoon Pulmonary Vein Ablation of Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo>' (MACPAF; clinicaltrials.gov NCT01061931) compared the efficacy and safety of two balloon-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation for symptomatic paroxysmal AF using the Arctic Front® or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> Mesh Ablator® catheter according to study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (PVI) at the end of the ablation procedure, determined by exit block after achieving entrance block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up data are not included in this publication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' mean age was 61.7 ± 8.9 years, 43.2% were female, and median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of the primary endpoint was 56.5% in patients randomized to the Arctic Front® and 9.5% in patients randomized to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> Mesh Ablator® catheter (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the per-protocol analysis, complete PVI was achieved in 13 (76.5%) of 17 Arctic Front® patients but in none of the 15 HD Mesh Ablator® patients (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were one major and two minor complications in each study arm but no clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural AF recurrence was detected within hospital stay in two (11.8%) Arctic Front® patients and in seven (46.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> Mesh Ablator® patients (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MACPAF study revealed a superiority of the Arctic Front® catheter concerning complete PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Owing to the insufficient efficacy of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> Mesh Ablator® catheter, the safety board decided to stop MACPAF prematurely </plain></SENT>
