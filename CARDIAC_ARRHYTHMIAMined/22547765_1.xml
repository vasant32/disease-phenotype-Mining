<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyse the long-term efficacy and safety of programming a high number of ATP attempts for FVTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients receiving an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> for primary and secondary prevention between 2000 and 2009 were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators were programmed to deliver 10 ATP attempts for FVT cycle lengths (CLs) of 250-300 ms (200-240 b.p.m.) before shock delivery (5 bursts, then 5 ramps; 8-10 extrastimuli at 81-88% FVT CL; minimal pacing CL 180 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 770 patients included and followed for 40.6 Â± 25.6 months, 137 (17.8%) experienced a total of 1839 FVTs, 1713 of which were ATP-terminated (unadjusted efficacy = 93.1%, adjusted = 81.7%), 106 ATP-accelerated (5.8%), and 20 ATP-resistant (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of FVT episodes were successfully treated by one or two attempts (98.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patient-based analysis showed that 17 (12.4%), 8 (5.8%), and 5 patients (2.1%) had at least one episode treated by three or more, four or more, and five or more ATP attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The benefit of this strategy was reduced after five attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of FVT episodes was asymptomatic and diagnosed at device interrogation during follow-up: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> occurred in only 0.2 and 0.4% of episodes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Programming a high number of ATP attempts (up to five ATP attempts) in the FVT zone is both safe and efficient and could prevent shocks in numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
