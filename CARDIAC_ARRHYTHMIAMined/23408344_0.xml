<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal RyR2 function is recognized as an important part of the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart, the balance between the cytosolic and intra-SR Ca(2+) regulation of RyR2 function maintains the contraction-relaxation cycle, in HF, this behaviour is compromised by excessive post-translational modifications of the RyR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such modification of the Ca(2+) release channel impairs the ability of the RyR2 to properly deactivate leading to a spectrum of Ca(2+)-dependent pathologies that include cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and structural remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the underlying causes and pathological consequences of abnormal RyR2 function in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also discuss the implications of these findings for HF therapy </plain></SENT>
