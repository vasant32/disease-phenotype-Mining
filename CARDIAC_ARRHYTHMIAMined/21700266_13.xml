<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified two families with a previously undescribed lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> disorder of infancy; the disorder comprises a distinct combination of an aged appearance, craniofacial anomalies, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, global developmental delays, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using X chromosome exon sequencing and a recently developed probabilistic algorithm aimed at discovering disease-causing variants, we identified in one family a c.109T&gt;C (p.Ser37Pro) variant in NAA10, a gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the major human N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A parallel effort on a second unrelated family converged on the same variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absence of this variant in controls, the amino acid conservation of this region of the protein, the predicted disruptive change, and the co-occurrence in two unrelated families with the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> suggest that this is the pathogenic mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this by demonstrating a significantly impaired biochemical activity of the mutant hNaa10p, and from this we conclude that a reduction in acetylation by hNaa10p causes this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we provide evidence of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> resulting from direct impairment of N-terminal acetylation, one of the most common protein modifications in humans </plain></SENT>
