<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment regimens for patients suffering from both diseases generally include prolonged use of anti-diabetic drugs for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and anti-arrhythmic drugs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of the study is to compare the influence of Mexiletine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">Disopyramide</z:chebi> on the pharmacodynamics (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e>) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and diabetic induced rats (with Alloxan monohydrate 100 mg/kg body weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>Albino</z:mp> rats weighing between 160 and 280 g were administered oral doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> 0.72 mg/kg, Mexiletine 36 mg/kg, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">Disopyramide</z:chebi> 18 mg/kg of bodyweight and their combination, with 1 week of washout between treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen rats were divided into three sub-sets with six rats in each sub-set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 4 days, the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was estimated to confirm the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) using MedCalc(Â®) software Version 11.6.1.0 was performed to analyze mean change in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between treatments with body weight as co-variable and treatment as factor for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in mean change in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> in comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> + Mexiletine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">Disopyramide</z:chebi> was observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats (P = 0.606) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The maximum mean change in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> + Mexiletine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">Disopyramide</z:chebi> was observed at 1 h and 8 h in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post hoc analysis showed baseline correction method has increased the reliability of the results (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study concludes that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> was not affected by the anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study introduced a new statistical methodology for analyzing the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> endpoint </plain></SENT>
