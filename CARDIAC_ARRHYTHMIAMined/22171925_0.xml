<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the 2 trials presented here (MAIA and CORYFEE) was to assess celivarone efficacy in the maintenance of sinus rhythm postcardioversion and for the conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the MAIA trial, 673 patients with AF/AFL recently converted to sinus rhythm were randomly assigned to receive 50, 100, 200, or 300 mg once-daily dosing of celivarone; 200 mg daily of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> preceded by a loading dose of 600 mg for 10 days; or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 months' follow up, no significant difference was observed in time to AF/AFL relapse among the various celivarone groups and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, fewer symptomatic AF/AFL recurrences were observed in the lower-dose celivarone groups (26.6% for celivarone 50 mg [P = 0.022] and 25.2% for celivarone 100 mg [P = 0.018] vs 40.5% for placebo at 90 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fewer adverse events were observed with the use of celivarone and placebo than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CORYFEE study, 150 patients with AF/AFL were randomly assigned to once-daily celivarone dosing of 300 or 600 mg, or placebo, for a 2-day treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the rate of spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm between the treatment and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these studies, celivarone does not appear to be efficacious in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF/AFL patients or for the conversion of AF/AFL patients.â€ƒ </plain></SENT>
