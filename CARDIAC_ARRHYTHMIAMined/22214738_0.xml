<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 38 patients who were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (New York Heart Association functional class III-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (11 men, 14 women; mean age 70.5 ± 11.13 years) were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> infusion and 13 patients (5 men, 8 women; mean age 71.08 ± 6.86 years) were treated with dobutamine infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> was administered with an initial bolus dose of 12 μg/kg for 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 μg/kg/min for 1 hour and 0.1 μg/kg/min 23 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous dobutamine was administered with a continuous dose of 10 μg/kg /min for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and electrocardiograms were obtained before and after drug infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QTc dispersion was defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum QT intervals and the value was corrected for heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chi-square test, Wilcoxon test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were found before and after treatment of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> and dobutamine with respect to minimum QT intervals, maximum QT and QT dispersions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(Pretreatment and 24th hour values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> group were; 0.43 ± 0.04 s, 0.44 ± 0.04s; 0.49 ± 0.05s, 0.50 ± 0.05s; 0.06 ± 0.03s, 0.06 ± 0.03s; in dobutamine group values are - 0.39 ± 0.05 s, 0.41 ± 0.05s; 0.45 ± 0.05s, 0.48 ± 0.05s; 0.06 ± 0.04s, 0.06 ± 0.04s, respectively) (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No side effects related to drugs were seen during follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, therapeutic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> infusion do not have a significant effect on QT parameters - the predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>-, in patients with decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> when compared with dobutamine infusion </plain></SENT>
