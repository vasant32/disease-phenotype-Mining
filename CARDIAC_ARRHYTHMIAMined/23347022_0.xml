<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF impact on daily clinical practice is steadily rising, together with population aging and increased survival from underlying conditions closely associated with AF such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although antiarrhythmic therapy, oral anticoagulation, implanted device therapy, and ablation techniques are now <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common and promptly available strategies in AF management, some of them are burdened by a low efficacy rate, while others are associated with increased proarrhythmic or hemorrhagic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, useful alternatives are being sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between those, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (n-3 PUFAs) have risen from mere alternative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> management to powerful and well-tolerated antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiarrhythmogenic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the evidence collected through basic science studies, whether on in vivo myocytes, animal models, or surrogate end points in human, n-3 PUFAs seem to offer innumerable advantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, epidemiological and clinical trials failed to demonstrate a clear efficacy of n-3 PUFAs as antiarrhythmic drugs, although covered by an optimal safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present review is to summarize the most important evidences currently available on the role of n-3 PUFA in AF management and therapy </plain></SENT>
