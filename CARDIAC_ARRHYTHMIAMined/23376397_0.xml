<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies revealed that a variant of SKCa is associated with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Roles of SKCa in atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine roles of SKCa in atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Optical mapping using the isolated canine left atrium was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The optical action potential duration (APD) and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were evaluated before and after the addition of specific SKCa blockers-apamin or UCL-1684 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SKCa blockade significantly increased APD80 (188±19 ms vs 147±11 ms; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pacing cycle length thresholds to induce 2:2 alternans, and wave breaks were prolonged by SKCa blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased APD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed after the SKCa blockade, as measured by the difference between the maximum and the minimum APD (39±4 ms vs 26±5 ms; P&lt;.05), by standard deviation (12.43±2.36 ms vs 7.49±1.47 ms; P&lt;.001), or by coefficient of variation (6.68%±0.97% vs 4.90%±0.84%; P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was induced at baseline by an S1-S2 protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After SKCa blockade, 4 of 6 atria developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SKCa blockade promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and prolongs the pacing cycle length threshold of 2:2 alternans and wave breaks in the canine left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The proarrhythmic effect could be attributed to increased APD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the canine left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study provides supportive evidence of genome-wide association studies showing association of KCNN3 and lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
