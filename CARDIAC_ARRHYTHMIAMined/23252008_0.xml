<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: There is still a lack of large-scale studies focusing on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (AFM) and knowledge of this disease is unimpressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the clinical features of AFM and improve the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, we analysed the data of consecutive Chinese AFM patients admitted to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective observational study analysed the data of 40 patients with a diagnosis of AFM admitted to our hospital between January 2003 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 28.5 +/- 18.4 years and 70% of patients were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>90.0% of patients had a short <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> prodrome, 77.5% had cardiogenic shock and 35.0% had multiple organ failure, especially hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common manifestations in ECG were low voltage in the limb leads (87.5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> like ECG changes were not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly reduced (25.3 +/- 7.5%), but the left cardiac sizes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of the patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5.0% needed an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and 35.0% were treated with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 39 (95.0%) patients were discharged alive and one man died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LVEF and left cardiac chambers at follow-up did not change as compared with discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the clinical features of Chinese AFM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The short- and mid-term prognosis of AFM is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>AFM patients may benefit from a treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
