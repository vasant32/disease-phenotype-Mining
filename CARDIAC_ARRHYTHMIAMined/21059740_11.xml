<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As several experimental and clinical studies suggest that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have antiarrhythmic properties even at the atrial level, we aimed to evaluate whether oral supplementation with PUFAs, in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, could reduce the recurrence rate of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after ECV of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and four patients (mean age 69.3 years, 33% females) with persistent AF were randomly assigned to receive 3 g/day of PUFAs until ECV and 2 g/day thereafter (104 patients) or placebo (100 patients) for 6 months, beginning at least 1 week before ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selection of conventional antiarrhythmic prophylaxis was left to local medical advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac rhythm was assessed by both trans-telephonic monitoring and clinical visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end-point was the recurrence rate of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm was restored, either spontaneously or after ECV, in 187 patients (91.7%); 95 patients (91.4%) on PUFAs and 92 patients (92.0%) on placebo (P=not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF relapsed in 56 (58.9%) of the PUFAs patients and in 47 (51.1%) of the placebo patients (P=0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean time to AF recurrence was 83±8 days in the PUFAs group and 106±9 days in the placebo group (P=0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the hypothesis that, in patients undergoing ECV of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> persistent AF, supplementation with PUFAs in addition to the usual antiarrhythmic treatment reduces recurrent AF </plain></SENT>
