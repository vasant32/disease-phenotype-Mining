<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, as measured in diet and plasma, and risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The analysis was conducted within the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was examined prospectively in 88,375 women who were free of disease in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake, other nutrients, and lifestyle factors was updated every 2-4 y through questionnaires, and 505 cases of sudden or arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were documented over 26 y of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, a nested case-control analysis including 99 SCD cases and 291 controls matched for age, ethnicity, smoking, and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment for confounders and potential intermediaries, the relative risk of SCD was significantly lower in women in the highest quartile compared with those in the lowest quartile of dietary (relative risk: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.91) and plasma (relative risk: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.60) <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The linear inverse relation with SCD was strongest for plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (P for trend = 0.003), in which each 0.25-mg/dL (1 SD) increment in plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was associated with a 41% (95% CI: 15%, 58%) lower risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of women, higher plasma concentrations and dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intakes were associated with lower risks of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the observed association is causal, interventions directed at increasing dietary or plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> might lower the risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
