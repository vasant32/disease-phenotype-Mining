<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The heart is an organ that is exposed to extreme dynamic mechanical stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From birth till <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the heart indefinitely repeats periodic contraction and dilation, i.e., shortening and elongation of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mechanical stretch elicits a change in heart rate and may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> if it is excessive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, mechanosensitivity is crucial to heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecule that is substantially involved in mechanosensitivity is a stretch-activated ion channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among several ion channels believed to be activated by stretch in the heart, the stretch-activated KCa (SAKCA) channel, a member of the group of large conductance (Big <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi>, BK) channels, shows a mechanosensitive (MS) response to membrane stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As BK channels respond to voltage and intracellular calcium concentration with large conductance, they are considered to be involved in repolarization after depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some BK channels are known to be activated by stretch and are expressed in a number of cells, including human osteoblasts and guinea pig intestinal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SAKCA channel was found to be sensitive to stretch in the chick heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given that the cardiomyocyte is unremittingly exposed to contraction and dilation and that it generates action potential and its contractility is modulated by intracellular calcium concentration, the SAKCA channel, which is dependent voltage and calcium, may be involved in action potential generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was recently reported that a BK channel is involved in the modulation of heart rate in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies regarding the role of MS BK channels, including SAKCA, in the modulation of heart rate and contractility are expected </plain></SENT>
