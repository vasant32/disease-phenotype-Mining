<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The surgical management of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (ACHD) offers a great challenge, with a large number of anomalies with complex pathophysiology necessitating specific treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative morbidity has been relatively high, and the influencing factors are not completely identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the incidence and predictors of postoperative complications following surgery for ACHD centralized to a Swedish cardiothoracic center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Between April 2003 and May 2012, 191 consecutive patients with ACHD underwent 192 surgical procedures at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were prospectively entered in a clinical database and retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to identify determinants of postoperative complications as a composite end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 98.3% ± 1.0 at 1 year and 98.3% ± 1.0 at 5 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat sternotomy had to be performed in 94 patients (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter was the most prevalent (13%, n = 17/135) postoperative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for major postoperative complications were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.81/10 year increment, P = 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.53), reduced (&lt;50%) systemic left ventricle ejection fraction (OR 3.61, P = 0.031; 95% CI 1.13-11.6), and the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (OR 3.34/60 minute increase, P &lt; 0.001; 95% CI 2.03-5.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our present data suggest that surgery in ACHD can be performed in centralized units with an excellent early and midterm survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative complications was relatively low consisting mainly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, ACHD surgery should be performed in centralized units with experienced surgeons in a dedicated multidisciplinary team for optimized postoperative management </plain></SENT>
