<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been persuasively shown in the last two decades that the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is closely linked to distinct alterations in Ca(2+) cycling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A crucial point in this respect is an increased spontaneous release of Ca(2+) out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors type 2 (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The consequence is a compromised sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) storage capacity, which impairs systolic contractility and possibly diastolic cardiac function due to Ca(2+) overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, leaky RyR2 are more and more regarded to potently induce proarrhythmic triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elimination of spontaneously released Ca(2+) via RyR2 in diastole can cause a transient sarcolemmal inward current and hence delayed after depolarisations as substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, the pathological role and consequences of the SR Ca(2+)-leak and its regulation are reviewed with a main focus on protein kinase A and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent kinase II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We summarise clinical consequences of "leaky RyR2" as well as possible therapeutic strategies in order to correct RyR2 dysfunction and discuss the significance of the available data </plain></SENT>
