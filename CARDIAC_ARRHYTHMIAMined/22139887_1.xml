<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared endocardial voltage mapping (EVM) and contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) for imaging scar lesions in ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 23 consecutive ARVC patients (16 males; mean age, 38±12 years) who underwent RV EVM and CE-CMR and 37 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 21 (91%) of 23 ARVC patients, RV EVM was abnormal, with a total of 45 electroanatomical scars (EAS): 17 (38%) in the inferobasal region, 12 (26.6%) in the anterolateral region, 8 (17.7%) in the RV outflow tract (RVOT), and 8 (17.7%) in the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RV delayed contrast enhancement (DCE) was found in 9 (39%) of 23 patients, with a total of 23 RV DCE scars: 4 (17.4%) in the inferobasal region, 9 (39.1%) in the anterolateral region, 4 (17.4%) in the RVOT, and 6 (26.1%) in the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a mismatch in 24 RV scars, with 22 EAS not confirmed by DCE and 2 DCE scars (both in the RVOT) undetected by EVM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 (75%) of 12 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003920'>abnormal RV</z:mp> EVM/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RV DCE, ≥1 DCEs were identified in the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, ventricular DCE was detected in 78% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No control subjects showed either EAS or DCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EVM and CE-CMR allow identification of RV scar lesions in most ARVC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CE-CMR is less sensitive than EVM in identifying RV scar lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of LV DCE confirms the frequent biventricular involvement and indicates the diagnostic relevance of LV scar detection by CE-CMR </plain></SENT>
