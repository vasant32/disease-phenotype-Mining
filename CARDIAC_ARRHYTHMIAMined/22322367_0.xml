<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been introduced for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> because it offers the ability to create rapid tissue modification in confined volumes without directly contacting the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of the benefits of HIFU, a number of limitations have been reported, which hindered its clinical adoption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we used a multimodal approach to evaluate thermal and nonthermal effects of HIFU in cardiac ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a computer controlled system capable of simultaneous fluorescence mapping and HIFU ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this system, linear lesions were created in isolated rabbit atria (n=6), and point lesions were created in the ventricles of whole-heart (n=6) preparations by applying HIFU at clinical doses (4-16 W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we evaluate the gap size in ablation lines necessary for conduction in atrial preparations (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The voltage sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS was used to assess functional damage produced by HIFU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optical coherence tomography and general histology were used to evaluate lesion extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conduction block was achieved in 1 (17%) of 6 atrial preparations with a single ablation line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following 10 minutes of rest, 0 (0%) of 6 atrial preparations demonstrated sustained conduction block from a single ablation line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue displacement of 1 to 3 mm was observed during HIFU application due to acoustic radiation force along the lesion line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, excessive acoustic pressure and high temperature from HIFU generated cavitation, causing macroscopic tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A minimum gap size of 1.5 mm was found to conduct electric activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 3 potential mechanisms responsible for the failure of HIFU ablation in cardiac tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both acoustic radiation force and acoustic cavitation, in conjunction with inconsistent thermal deposition, can increase the risk of lesion discontinuity and result in gap sizes that promote ablation failure </plain></SENT>
