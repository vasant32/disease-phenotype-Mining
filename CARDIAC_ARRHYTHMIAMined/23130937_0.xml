<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide range of anesthesia options are available, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> can be safely administered in EP laboratory with proper monitoring, drug selection, airway management equipment, and trained personnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to knowing the patient's clinical status, a thorough understanding of the clinical pharmacology of each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agent</z:chebi> is essential in order to select appropriate drug among a variety of available <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi>, to monitor for adverse effects, and to ensure adequate sedation and anesthesia for a comfortable, safe, and successful procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a general strategy of anesthesia is planned, an individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agent</z:chebi> or combination of agents can be selected based on their pharmacological properties while keeping in mind the desired sedation/anesthesia requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> are often used in combination, the synergistic interaction of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> (infiltrative, parenteral, and/or inhaled) needs to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further attention also needs to be paid to the interaction between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> and other existing medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> care providers should work collaboratively and communicate frequently to provide a safe and effective anesthesia </plain></SENT>
