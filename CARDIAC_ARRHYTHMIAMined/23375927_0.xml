<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SQTS is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis in young patients have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an international case series involving 15 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were analyzed for electrocardiography characteristics, genotype, clinical events, Gollob score, and efficacy of medical or defibrillator (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>]) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the possible prognostic value of the Gollob score, we devised a modified Gollob score that excluded clinical events from the original score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients 21 years of age or younger (84% males, median age: 15 years, interquartile range: 9 to 18 years) were followed up for 5.9 years (interquartile range: 4 to 7.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median corrected QT interval for heart rate was 312 ms (range: 194 to 355 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms occurred in 14 (56%) of 25 patients and included aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in 6 patients (24%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 4 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were common and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 1), and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (84%) had a familial or personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A gene mutation associated with SQTS was identified in 5 (24%) of 21 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients had a higher median modified Gollob score (excluding points for clinical events) compared with asymptomatic patients (5 vs. 4, p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten patients received medical treatment, mainly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 25 index cases underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients had appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks were observed in 64% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SQTS is associated with aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> among the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients with a Gollob score of &lt;5 remained event free, except for an isolated episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, over an average 6-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A higher modified Gollob score of 5 or more was associated with the likelihood of clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Young SQTS patients have a high rate of inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
