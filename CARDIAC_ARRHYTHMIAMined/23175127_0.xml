<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cumulative evidence highlights the importance of genetic defects in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is of remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the genetic determinants of AF in a vast majority of patients remain illusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the coding exons and splice junctions of the GATA5 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiogenesis, were sequenced in 118 unrelated patients with lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the index patient carrying an identified mutation and 200 unrelated ethnically-matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of the mutant GATA5 was characterized in contrast to its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, a novel heterozygous GATA5 mutation, p.W200G, was identified in a family with AF inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was absent in 200 control individuals and the altered amino acid was completely conserved evolutionarily across species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis showed that the mutation of GATA5 was associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in AF, suggesting potential implications for the early prophylaxis and gene-specific therapy of AF </plain></SENT>
