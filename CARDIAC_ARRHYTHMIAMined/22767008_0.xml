<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published studies unfortunately used standard lead positions for recording ECGs and underestimated the true prevalence of BTEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, by placing right precordial leads at higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>, we aimed to find out the true prevalence of BTEP in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Healthy male volunteers (n= 504) between 18 and 55 years of age (37.3 Â± 10.7 years) without known cardiac or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the standard ECG recording, two other recordings were obtained by placing the right precordial leads to the third and second <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were stratified by two independent reviewers for the presence of BTEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 15 subjects (3%) who displayed BTEP on their standard ECG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Number of cases displaying BTEP increased to 25 (5%) and 38 (7.5%) when the right precordial leads were moved to third and second <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although none of the subjects displayed type 1 BTEP on their standard ECGs, three subjects displayed type 1 BTEP on the third and four subjects displayed type 1 BTEP on the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the prevalence of BTEP in healthy male subjects was 7.5% by placing the right precordial leads to higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Instead of standard lead locations that are not sensitive enough for detection of BTEP we recommend high right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICS</z:e> recording in further prevalence studies </plain></SENT>
