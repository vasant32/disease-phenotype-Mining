<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient admitted to overdosing with digoxin 15-20 h before presentation with intent to commit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum digoxin level was 35.6 ng/ml and renal function was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient was treated with 1,040 mg of digoxin-specific antibody Fab fragment with prompt resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and restoration of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hours after digoxin antibody administration, serum digoxin level declined to 0.2 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours after treatment with Fab fragment, patient developed premature ventricular complexes, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, and non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> from which she was successfully resuscitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and emergent coronary angiogram did not reveal significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat digoxin level was 20.4 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of recrudescent digoxin toxicity was made and the patient was treated with one session of plasma exchange with resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediately after plasma exchange, digoxin level decreased to 10.4 ng/ml, and after 10 h, the level further decreased to 6.6 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The following day, digoxin level had decreased to 2.9 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience with this case would suggest that plasma exchange should be considered as a treatment modality for recrudescent digoxin toxicity </plain></SENT>
