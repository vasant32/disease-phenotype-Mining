<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and predictive factors of complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB) and permanent pacemaker implantation (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No data exist on the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after TAVI versus SAVR in patients with similar baseline electrocardiographic (ECG) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 411 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) and no prior pacemaker who underwent TAVI with the balloon-expandable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Lifesciences, Irvine, California) were matched (1:1) with 411 elderly patients with severe AS who underwent isolated SAVR on the basis of baseline ECG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence, reasons, and predictive factors for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> within 30 days after the procedure were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was similar in both groups (p = 0.11), and the TAVI group had a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of new <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> was higher after TAVI (7.3%) compared with SAVR (3.4%), p = 0.014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete AVB and severe symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, respectively, were the reasons for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> in the TAVI (5.6% and 1.7%, respectively) and SAVR (2.7% and 0.7%, respectively) groups (p = 0.039 for complete AVB, p = NS for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> was the only variable associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> in the TAVI group (odds ratio: 8.61, 95% confidence interval: 3.14 to 23.67, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas no variable was found in the SAVR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation was associated with a higher rate of complete AVB and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> compared with SAVR in elderly patients with severe AS and similar baseline ECG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> correlated with the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> in the TAVI group </plain></SENT>
