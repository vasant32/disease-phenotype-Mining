<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the scope and nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in a geographically defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> cases involving persons aged 2-40 years identified from the 2008 comprehensive Coroner database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 1741 Coroner's cases, 376 were considered potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> cases and underwent review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 174 cases of adjudicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> from a population of 6,602,680 persons aged 2-40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was present in 126 cases (72%), 78% of which was unrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no identifiable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 48 cases (28%), representing primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of decedents were men (76%) over the age of 18 (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> increased with age from 0.7/100,000 (2-18 years) to 2.4/100,000 (19-29 years) to 5.3/100,000 (30-40 years) person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Persons experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> before age 30 were more likely to have a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome (odds ratio 2.97; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of events occurred in the home (72%); 33% of the events in children/adolescents and 9% of the events in adults occurred during reported moderate or vigorous exercise (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during organized competitive sports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> increases with age, typically occurring in a man at rest in the home with unrecognized underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prevention strategies should consider targeting identification of unrecognized structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
