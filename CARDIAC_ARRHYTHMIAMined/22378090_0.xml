<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study comprised 229 patients from an <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-replete area (115 women, 114 men, mean age 63.8 ± 9.2 years), chronically treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases were clinically investigated prior to, and during treatment, by thyroid 2D and color Doppler flow sonography, thyroid function tests (TSH, FT3, FT4), and antithyroid antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 88 patients (38.4%) who developed thyroid dysfunction, 47 (20.5%) presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> (AIT) and 41 (17.9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (AIH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is an evident prevalence of subclinical AIH (29 cases), compared to subclinical AIT (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding clinical forms, these prevailed in AIT (44 patients) (p 〈 0.001, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thyrotoxic patients were classified in pathogenic types as follows: 11 cases as type 1, 15 cases as type 2, and 21 cases as mixed form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most important risk factor for the development of thyroid dysfunction was represented by the underlying thyroid pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid abnormalities</z:hpo> (diffuse or nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goitre</z:hpo> and/or positive antithyroid antibodies) developed earlier thyroid dysfunction compared to those with an apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thyroid gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The thyroid dysfunction occurrence was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> (4-84 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thyrotoxicosis</z:e> involved especially young ages, while AIH affected later years.The daily dose, the duration of the treatment and the cumulative dose of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> do not represent risk factors in thyroid dysfunction development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The determination of serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> and desethylamiodarone concentrations does not offer benefits in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the incidence of AIH was similar to that reported in <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-replete areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AIT was higher that previously reported, a fact underlining the importance of the proper screening and monitoring of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cases with previous thyroid morphologic and/or immunologic abnormalities require frequent monitoring </plain></SENT>
