<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, non-optimal pumping speeds can reduce the efficacy of circulatory support or cause dangerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optimal flow control for continuous flow LVADs has not been defined and calls for an implantable pressure sensor integrated with the LVAD for real-time feedback control of pump speed based on ventricular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A MEMS pressure sensor prototype is designed, fabricated and seamlessly integrated with LVAD to enable real-time control, optimize its performance and reduce its risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pressure sensing mechanism is based on Fabry-PÃ©rot interferometer principle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A biocompatible parylene diaphragm with a silicon mirror at the center is fabricated directly on the inlet shell of the LVAD to sense pressure changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, range and response time of the pressure sensor are measured and validated to meet the requirements of LVAD pressure sensing </plain></SENT>
