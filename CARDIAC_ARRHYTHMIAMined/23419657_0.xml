<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We applied adaptive-servo ventilation (ASV) and examined the effects of ASV combined with deep <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation on PVI using a NavX.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 75 paroxysmal AF (PAF) patients (62 ± 11 years; 53 men and 22 women) who underwent PVI for treatment of PAF using an ASV system combined with deep sedation (ASV group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Control patients included 75 consecutive PAF patients (62 ± 11 years; 51 men and 24 women) who underwent PVI just before introduction of the ASV system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deep sedation was defined as a Ramsay sedation score of 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ASV group had a lower frequency of restless body movements compared with the control group during PVI (1.5 ± 0.7 vs. 7.8 ± 1.4 times, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of respiratory compensation and EnGuide alignment of catheter position by the NavX was lower in the ASV (4.2 ± 3.3 and 8.8 ± 7.1 times) than control group (7.1 ± 5.1 and 15.2 ± 10.0 times, P &lt; 0.05 and &lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, significantly lower total electrical energy supply (48.7 ± 6.0 KJ) was required in the ASV than control group (64.5 ± 24.9 KJ, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, significantly shorter fluoroscopy and procedural times were observed in the ASV (28 ± 5 and 109 ± 25 min) than the control group (33 ± 6 and 141 ± 38 min, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) and the AF recurrence rate was significantly lower in the ASV than the control group (12 vs. 25%, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: ASV combined with deep sedation is an effective strategy during PVI using the NavX in patients with PAF </plain></SENT>
