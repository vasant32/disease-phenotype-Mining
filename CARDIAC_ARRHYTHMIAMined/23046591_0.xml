<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate whether exposure to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) was a risk factor for AF, and to discern which patients were at the highest risk for AF due to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 7280 patients with newly diagnosed AF from 2000 to 2009 were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the same date of enrollment, 10 patients without AF, who were matched for age, sex, and underlying disease for each study patient, were selected to be the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> exposure before enrollment and AF risk was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use was associated with an increased AF risk, especially for new users (odds ratio [OR]=1.651) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among new users, subgroup analysis revealed that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were at the highest risk for AF (OR=1.920) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients who were only exposed to selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors, no significant associations were found between AF and selective COX2 inhibitor use, except for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> kidney or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (OR=1.656 and 1.707, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use may predispose patients to AF, and the risk is almost doubled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of selective COX2 inhibitors was not significantly related to AF occurrence, except in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> kidney or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
