<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and has been identified as an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation has become an established rhythm control therapy in patients with highly symptomatic drug-refractory AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The definition of ablation success remains controversial since current symptom-based or intermittent electrocardiogram monitoring strategies fail to sufficiently disclose rhythm outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This failure is mainly related to the high incidence of asymptomatic AF recurrences, the unpredictable nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> relapses, and the poor correlation of symptoms and AF episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is a clear correlation between the intensity of the monitoring strategy and the sensitivity for it to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several clinical studies assessing the long-term efficacy of catheter ablation procedures have reported late AF recurrences in patients who were initially considered responders to catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In certain subsets of patients, precise long-term monitoring may help to guide therapy, e.g. patients in whom withdrawal of antithrombotic therapy may be considered if they are free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, subcutaneous implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) have been introduced for prolonged and continuous rhythm monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The performance of a leadless ICM equipped with a dedicated AF detection algorithm has recently been assessed in a clinical trial demonstrating a high sensitivity and overall accuracy for identifying patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of ICM-based follow-up strategies, however, has to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials </plain></SENT>
