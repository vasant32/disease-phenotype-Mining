<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This case report describes a rare and potentially fatal condition associated with anesthesia administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to discuss the causes of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during the perioperative period in apparently healthy patients and the pathophysiology of anomalous origin of the coronary arteries as a cause of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Female patient, 44 years old, with no previous symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during general anesthesia in two different situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first episode, the patient presented signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdomen, but remained hemodynamically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following induction of anesthesia, the patient exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> refractory to volume replacement and vasopressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The condition progressed to <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was successfully resuscitated and discharged from the hospital in good condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second episode, one year after the first, the patient was in good clinical condition to undergo an elective surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After induction of anesthesia, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp>, which was promptly reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After extensive investigation, an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our report is illustrative as it emphasizes that a thorough diagnostic investigation should be done in cases of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during the perioperative period, even in patients that appear to be healthy </plain></SENT>
