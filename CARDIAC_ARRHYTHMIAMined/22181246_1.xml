<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In diseased hearts reentrant waves can be associated with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper we investigate the conditions that lead to wave break, reentry, and propagation failure in mathematical models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> excitable media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> are considered: sinks are regions in space in which the voltage is fixed at its rest value, and breaks are nonconducting regions with no-flux boundary conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that randomly distributed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in the medium have a decremental effect on the velocity, and above a critical density of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> the conduction fails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using numerical and analytical methods we derive the general relationship among the conduction velocity, density of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo>, diffusion coefficient, and the rise time of the excitation in both two and three dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work helps us understand the factors leading to reduced propagation velocity and the formation of spiral waves in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> excitable media </plain></SENT>
