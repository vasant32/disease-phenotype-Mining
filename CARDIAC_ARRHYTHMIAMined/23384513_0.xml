<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both GAD and its cardinal symptom - worry - have been shown to promote muted physiological reactivity in response to laboratory and ecological stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no study to date has examined the concurrent and relative contributions of trait and state worry within healthy controls, (non-clinical) high trait-worry controls, and GAD participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study examined heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) responses to laboratory stress during and following the experimental induction of worry versus relaxation in healthy controls (n=42), high trait worriers (n=33) and participants with GAD (n=76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups exhibited increased HR and decreased RSA in response to the stressor, with no differences by condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline sAA significantly moderated HR and RSA reactivity, such that higher sAA predicted greater increases in HR and decreases in RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant group by baseline sAA interaction such that in GAD, higher baseline sAA predicted decreased change in sAA during stress, whereas higher baseline sAA predicted greater sAA change in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-worry controls fell non-significantly between these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study provides additional evidence for the effect of worry on diminished HR stress response and points to possible suppression of adrenergic sympathetic stress responses in GAD </plain></SENT>
