<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> caused by 10-min coronary artery ligation, the intensity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> did not differ from the control in Wistar rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and increased in August rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of reperfusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> produced an antiarrhythmic effect in Wistar rats and did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in August rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of nitrates and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> in Wistar and August rats increased by 82 and 143%, respectively, compared to the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of hemoxygenase-1 (hsp32) in the myocardium remained unchanged in Wistar rats and decreased by 26% in August rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absence of antiarrhythmic effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in August rats is probably related to elevated NO content and reduced <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
