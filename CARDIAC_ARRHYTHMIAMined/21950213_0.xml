<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to examine the effect of an anaesthesia using 70% carbon dioxide and 30% oxygen on <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> stress reaction, behaviour and clinical parameters of male suckling piglets during castration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy one male piglets, three to five days of age, were allocated to two experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were assigned either to the procedures control handling, control castration, handling under anaesthesia or castration under anaesthesia in each experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> plasma concentrations were measured in blood samples taken before (-15 min) and after (immediately, 2 min) handling/castration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, behavioural observations and clinical parameters such as heart and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, reflexes and recovery time were assessed at several sampling times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> concentrations revealed an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups after handling/castration (p &lt; 0.0167), but higher concentrations were seen in the anaesthetized groups (25 to 93 times) than in control groups (two to four times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The excessive <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> reaction suggests that carbon dioxide inhalation causes a more stressful situation in piglets compared to castration without anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioural abnormalities, significant decreases in the heart rate, the respiratory rate and the oxygen saturation (p &lt; or = 0.001) including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp>) underline the impression that <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation anaesthesia negatively affects animal welfare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of this study, this <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> method is unsuitable to reduce stress induced by castration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research on alternatives is necessary to ensure the well-being of the piglets during castration </plain></SENT>
