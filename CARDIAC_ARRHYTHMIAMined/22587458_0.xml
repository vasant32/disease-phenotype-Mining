<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Liver transplantation (LT) is a potentially curative treatment for hereditary transthyretin <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, of which familial amyloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> (FAP) is the most common form in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the long-term development in heart rate variability (HRV) after LT in Swedish FAP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRV was analyzed before LT, and during a first (&lt;40 months) and a second (&gt;40 months) follow-up recording after transplantation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Power spectrum analysis was performed on 2-min sequences in the supine position and after passive tilt, after careful identification of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained from 33 patients, but 18 patients had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or were pacemaker-treated (4 before LT and 14 after LT) and three patients had not performed the first follow-up recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 12 patients, HRV decreased between the pretransplant evaluation and the first follow-up, thereafter no significant changes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study showed that the progressive development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> after LT is a major pitfall when assessing cardiac autonomic function in FAP patients, especially in patients older than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the minority of patients with sinus rhythm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recordings, cardiac autonomic modulation remained stable after transplantation and no improvement was noted </plain></SENT>
