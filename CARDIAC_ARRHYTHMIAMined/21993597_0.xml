<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the electrophysiological characteristics of the breakout site of ventricular activation using electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) and its relation to the optimal ablation site in idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmias originating from the outflow tract of the (RVOT) septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with symptomatic drug-refractory premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) originating from the RVOT septum and 5 control subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW syndrome</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low-voltage areas (LVAs) were defined as signal amplitudes between 0.1 and 1.5 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The borderline between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> area and the LVA was defined as "border," and the distance from the LVA to the border (length of LVA) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 28 patients and control subjects, there was an LVA below the pulmonary valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in length of LVA between patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and control subjects (2.0 ± 0.6 vs. 1.9 ± 0.1 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 19 of the 28 patients, the optimal ablation site was identical to the border area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients who had pre-potentials at the successful ablation site, there were two cases with polymorphic VT and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these two cases, length of LVA was longer than in other patients (4.0 and 3.9 cm vs. 1.8 ± 0.5 cm (n = 26)), and the optimal ablation site was located at the border area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The border area, including the LVA, tends to be the breakout site and/or origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in idiopathic ventricular tachyarrhythmia originating from the RVOT septum </plain></SENT>
