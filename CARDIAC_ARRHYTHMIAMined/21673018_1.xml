<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The surgical approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) has been largely replaced by percutaneous, catheter-based techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some VT circuits, particularly in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, remain inaccessible to percutaneous ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy of these VTs is an alternative approach; however, its methodology has not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative electroanatomic and electrophysiological characterization of the VT substrate and circuit to guide surgical ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients with recurrent sustained VT refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs underwent endocardial and/or epicardial ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomic mapping was performed, and the VT substrate and circuit(s) were defined using voltage, activation, entrainment, and pace mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 patients underwent detailed endocardial mapping; 6 patients also underwent epicardial mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was performed with the use of an open-irrigation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the unsuccessful percutaneous approach, surgical cryoablation was applied to the sites previously identified and targeted during the percutaneous procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 23 Â± 6 months (range, 15 to 34 months), 6 patients had significant reduction in VT burden as evident by a reduced number of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks after ablation (6.6 to 0.6 shocks per patient; P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, one of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and one of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VT circuits inaccessible to percutaneous ablation techniques are rare but can be encountered in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These VTs can be successfully targeted by surgical cryoablation guided by preoperative electroanatomic and electrophysiological mapping </plain></SENT>
