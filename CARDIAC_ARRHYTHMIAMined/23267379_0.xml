<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was carried out to evaluate the QTc interval in Iranian causalities (Janbazan) of Iran-Iraq war receiving maintenance <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2010, one hundred war causalities in Isfahan who chronically take daily dose of 20 mg or more of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> (more than 2 weeks), and did not have the history of cerebrovascular or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery diseases</z:hpo>, cardiac pacemaker, congenital prolonged QTC, or taking drugs affecting QTc, or having electrolyte abnormalities, were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An electrocardiogram was taken from each patient using cardiofax instrument, and QTC was calculated manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data was analyzed using SPSS software with descriptive statistical methods and Pearson's correlation coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male and had the mean age of 45.6 ± 6.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients received 20-240 mg <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> daily for 1 to 108 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The QTc was prolonged in 25% of the patients (QTc 5 450 ms), with the mean of 472.72 ± 18.5 ms (range 450-508 ms) and the mean daily dose of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> 85.2 ± 59.0 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant relationship was observed between QTC interval on the one hand, and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> dose (R = 0.025, P = 0.8), duration of treatment (R =-0.048, P = 0.68), age (R = 0.037, P = 0.71), and weight (R = 0.1, P = 0.21) of the patients, on the other hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had faint, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> causes prolongation of QTC interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the dosage of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> and duration of treatment were not statistically related to QTC interval </plain></SENT>
