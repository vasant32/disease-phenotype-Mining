<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, while NRIs acutely increase blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) due to enhanced sympathetic neurotransmission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment changes the responsiveness of the central noradrenergic system and suppresses these effects via autonomic regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the relationship between NE increases and cardiovascular safety, we investigated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of the NRI reboxetine on central NE release and on BP and HR and electrical alternans, a measure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> liability, in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NE release was assessed by microdialysis in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); BP and HR were measured by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were treated for 28 days with 15 mg/kg/day of reboxetine or vehicle via an osmotic minipump and then challenged with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravenous doses of reboxetine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals chronically treated with reboxetine had 2-fold higher extracellular basal NE levels in mPFC and PVN compared to basal levels after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BP was significantly increased after the first day of treatment, and gradually returned to vehicle levels by day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NRI treatment may lead to an increase in central NE levels and a concomitant reduction in BP based on exposure-response curves compared to vehicle treatment, suggesting a larger separation between preclinical estimates of efficacy vs. safety compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NRI treatment </plain></SENT>
