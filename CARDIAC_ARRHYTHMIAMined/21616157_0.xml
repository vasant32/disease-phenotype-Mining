<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> is a potentially lethal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better prediction and mechanistic understanding of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> is dependent on the development of good animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Minipigs are increasingly being used in cardiovascular research and we hypothesize that Langendorff-perfused minipig hearts could serve as a novel model of pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied arrhythmic biomarkers and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> using sharp electrode recordings and Langendorff-perfusion of minipig and dog hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearts were subjected to pharmacological blockade of repolarizing currents, chemical and surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>, and programmed electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Minipigs have significantly longer cardiac action potentials and QT intervals than dogs at comparable cycle lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, minipigs were relatively resistant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a variety of settings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were only observed in response to programmed electrical S1-S2 stimulation after surgical AV-ablation and combined I(Kr) and I(Ks) blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the short term variability of the action potential remained very low in minipigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the electro-mechanical window (EMw) remained positive in both dog and minipig experiments, although the EMw approached negative values in dogs during I(Ks) blockade and β-adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoprenaline</z:chebi>- or pacing-induced changes in frequency resulted in paradoxical transient effects on repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The evidence presented indicates that Langendorff-perfused Göttingen minipig hearts are resistant to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in experimental settings known to be pro-arrhythmic in other species including dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanistic explanation could be the long electrical systole compared to dogs, combined with a short vulnerable window, recorded in minipig hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also find that EMw recordings from Langendorff perfused hearts are less sensitive to I(Ks) blockade than what has been reported from in vivo experiments, most likely due to the mechanical properties of the recording apparatus </plain></SENT>
