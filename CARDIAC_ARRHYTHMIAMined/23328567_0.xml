<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of real-time computed tomographic (CT) imaging to guide the percutaneous placement of left ventricular (LV) leads in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, placement of the coronary sinus lead can be challenging and may require a more aggressive surgical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine swine were placed in a real-time CT scanner to define the safest percutaneous access strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under real-time CT guidance, a 3.5-F pacing lead was placed percutaneously in the anterolateral LV epicardium (n = 6 swine) or to the posterolateral wall after the creation of intentional left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> (n = 3 swine) in a tangential (n = 12) or perpendicular (n = 1) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pacing parameters and CT images were assessed during 30-min follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Necropsy findings were compared with real-time CT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CT imaging successfully defined the safest percutaneous access route in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 lead placements and guided the therapeutic creation of pneumothoraces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Needle trajectory remained within 5 mm of the access route defined on CT imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LV lead placement under CT guidance was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attempts within 19 ± 7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean pacing thresholds was 2.5 ± 1.5 V, the mean R wave amplitude was 11.2 ± 5.6 mV, and the mean impedance was 686 ± 103 Ω and remained unchanged after tangential placement during 30-min follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no cardiac complications were observed with tangential lead placement (12 of 12), the perpendicular approach resulted in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> requiring pericardiocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At necropsy, CT images correlated well with the in situ pathological results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous placement of LV pacing leads under CT guidance is feasible and might offer an alternative to more invasive surgical approaches in patients with complicated coronary sinus lead placement </plain></SENT>
