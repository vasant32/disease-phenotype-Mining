<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The utility of cardiac device-based intrathoracic monitoring (OptiVol, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) exacerbation has not been evaluated in pediatric or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a single center with an endocardial OptiVol capable device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OptiVol index values were collected in 2-week bins from January 2007 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> exacerbation defined as hospitalization or medication change for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and device-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> based on remote or in-office device interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and OptiVol data were collected by separate investigators blinded to the other parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OptiVol data were correlated to the clinical outcomes to determine sensitivity and predictability for multiple threshold values in the entire cohort and pediatric and congenital subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 1,106 months of OptiVol data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age of the cohort was 18 years (range 6-58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 23 pediatric, median age 13 years (range 6-16), at device implant, and 18 patients, median age 31 years (range 13-58), considered at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> at implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> exacerbations and 17 treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study population-specific positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of OptiVol was low (sensitivity 33% and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> â‰¤4.4%) for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> exacerbation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyzed groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and positive predictive value of intrathoracic impedance monitoring was low in this population of adult congenital and pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recent improvements to the OptiVol algorithm may decrease these deficiencies </plain></SENT>
