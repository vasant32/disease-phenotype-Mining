<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> is defined as transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and muscle tone, usually of short duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noncardiac causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> are classified as orthostatic intolerance syndromes (OIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QT and QTc (corrected QT) dispersions are the measurements of myocardial instability and show predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study; clinical findings, QT and QTc dispersions of the patients who were diagnosed as OIS were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the aim of the study is to clarify the association of clinical characteristics of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> with the outcome of the QT and QTc dispersions in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a retrospective study including 152 children and adolescents who had repeated unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or presyncope between June 2002 and August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Head-up Tilt table test (HUTT) were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control group consisted of 67 healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The QT and QTc dispersions were measured from the 12 ECG leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four (55.2%) patients had positive and 68 (44.8%) had negative response to HUTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>QT and QTc dispersions were significantly higher in HUTT-positive group than in negative (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, QTc dispersion was significantly higher in both vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and postural orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome groups than in HUTT-negative group (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specifity and sensitivity of QTc dispersion for predicting positive HUTT are 76.5% and 59.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the test calculated as 75.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that we can use QTc dispersion measurement as a noninvasive electrocardiographic test to evaluate OIS for predicting positive result before performing HUTT </plain></SENT>
