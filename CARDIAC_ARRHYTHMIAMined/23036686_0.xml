<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both electrical instability and structural remodelling could be factors that lead to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyse the expression of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (SCN5A) and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (KCND3) channels as well as the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> content in the ventricles of human HF and of non-diseased hearts under different post-mortem intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human hearts as controls [n=20 for the right ventricle (RV) and n=13 for the left ventricle (LV)] and human hearts from HF patients, which were obtained at the time of cardiac transplantation, as cases (n=48 for RV and n=34 for LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the SCN5A (probes SCN5A E4-5, E11-12, and E28) and KCND3 channels and of COLLAGEN I and III were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, paraffin sections were used to analyse the percentage of collagen deposition in both cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KCND3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the LV was lower in the cases than in controls (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of SCN5A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were found in the HF samples when analysed with probe SCN5A E4-5 (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCN5A expression was lower in the controls with longer post-mortem interval (n=4) than in the controls with a shorter post- mortem interval (n=16, P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KCND3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were also different between the two control groups (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collagen deposition was higher in the LV tissues of the cases when compared to controls (P&lt;.001), and it was higher in the LV from HF patients than in the RV (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, collagen deposition was higher in the LV samples from patients with implanted cardiac defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy than in the LV of patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that ionic and structural remodelling could be pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in HF patients </plain></SENT>
