<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies to date have addressed this topic.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the results of a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1982 and 2008, 287 patients with CHD, median age of 5 years (25-75%, 1-11) underwent cardiac pacing for sinus node dysfunction (SND) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB); 97% of patients underwent at least one heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endocardial systems (Endo) were implanted in 117 patients, epicardial systems (Epi) in 170, with 595 leads (228 Endo, 367 Epi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endocardial systems showed a significantly older age group with more frequent SND; Epi a younger age group, with more frequent AVB, greater number of surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications were mortality 0.6% (Epi), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> 0.6% (Epi), and haemothorax 3.4% (Endo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up is 5 (2-10) years: the pacing system failed in 29% of patients, 13% Endo, and 40% Epi (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of failure for Epi, a lower implant age, greater the number of leads implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of malfunction of the leads increases significantly for Epi and the younger age when implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The steroid-eluting leads have a lower risk of malfunction (P = 0.05), steroid-eluting Endo leads provide significantly better outcomes than Epi.CONCLUSION: Cardiac pacing in paediatric patients with CHD shows satisfactory results in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endocardial systems show significantly better results than Epi systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A younger age when implanted is a risk factor for complications at follow-up </plain></SENT>
