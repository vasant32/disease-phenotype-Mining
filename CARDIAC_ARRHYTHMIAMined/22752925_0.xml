<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the relationship between the size of the left atrial isolated surface area (ISA) after pulmonary vein antrum isolation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and rhythm outcome during a 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred one consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF (mean age, 59±11 years; median [range] AF history, 36 [24-96] months; mean left atrial size, 42±6 mm) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ISA was defined as the ratio of the total isolated antral surface area excluding the pulmonary veins to the sum of the total isolated antral surface area and the left atrial posterior wall surface area, while considering the individual characteristics of antral <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surface areas were assessed using the NavX system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 4 groups according to ISA (group I: &lt;50%; group II: 50 to &lt;60%; group III: 60 to &lt;70%; group IV: ≥70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average ISA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 59.2±11.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis showed that ISA was 42.8±4.2% in group I (n=23), 54.2±3.0% in group II (n=23), 64.3±3.0% in group III (n=33), and 73.9±3.6% in group IV (n=22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a 12-month follow-up period, 70% of patients in group I, 78% in group II, 97% in group III, and 100% in group IV were free from AF and atrial macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between groups I and III, I and IV, II and III, and II and IV but not groups I and II and groups III and IV (log-rank test P=0.024, 0.016, 0.037, 0.044, 0.584, and 0.500, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis yielded an optimal cutoff value of 55% for ISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months, a larger ISA was associated with a significantly lower AF and macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ISA≥55% may thus serve as a predictor for long-term success after pulmonary vein antrum isolation </plain></SENT>
