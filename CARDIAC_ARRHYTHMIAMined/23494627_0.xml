<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty-seven elderly patients (70 years old or older) undergoing isolated AVR (n = 120) or combined AVR/CABG (n = 37) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Operative outcomes were compared between the two surgical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was also compared between the groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and long-rank (Mantel-Cox) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was 0.8 % for the isolated AVR group and 5.4 % for the combined AVR/CABG group (p = 0.076) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The length of the intensive care unit stay for the combined AVR/CABG group was significantly longer than that for the isolated AVR group (median: 40 vs. 21 h, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the occurrence rate of hospital complications, such as reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, deep sternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, supra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and neurological complications, was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 3 and 5 years was 82.3 and 80.9 % for the isolated AVR group, and 88.3 and 73.0 % for the combined AVR/CABG group, respectively (p = 0.637) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The satisfactory operative and long-term results in our study support a more aggressive simultaneous coronary revascularization combined with AVR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
