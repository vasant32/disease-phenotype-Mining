<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> just before dosing (Cbep) and its clinical efficacy in Japanese patients (n=36) with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated orally with 100, 150 or 200 mg/d <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cbep were measured with UV-HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first 14 d, when 150, 200, 250 or 300 ng/mL was set as a boundary value, the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Cbep above than below the boundary value (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the maintenance stage (3 months longer after starting therapy), the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> was significantly higher in patients with Cbep above than below 300 ng/mL (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> was closely related to Cbep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The target value of Cbep to obtain a clinical benefit was approximately 300 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
