<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study examined relationships between attachment insecurity, parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity, indexed by respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), and adolescent adjustment to the loss of a close social partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adolescents with more attachment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> to their mother at age 14 were more likely to report poorer adjustment to a subsequent loss than adolescents with less attachment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attachment avoidance interacted with stress-induced changes in RSA to predict loss adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among adolescents with higher RSA in response to the stressor, those with more attachment avoidance reported better loss adjustment, whereas among adolescents with lower RSA in response to the stressor, those with more attachment avoidance reported poorer loss adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sum, the combination of attachment insecurity and stress-induced changes in RSA predicted how well adolescents adjusted to a loss </plain></SENT>
