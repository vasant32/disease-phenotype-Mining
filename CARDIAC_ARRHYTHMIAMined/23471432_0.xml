<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improvement of pharmacological therapy is needed.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo>, who developed post-operative JET and were treated with landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, representing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients treated at our university </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients, landiolol was used after failure of response to anti-arrhythmic therapies, including thermal control, sedation, discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, and pharmacological therapy with nifekalant and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Landiolol was used as a first-line therapy in the other two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, landiolol, at a dose ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 Âµg/kg/min, achieved successful sinus conversion within 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No adverse events, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e>, were encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients.CONCLUSION: Although limited to a small and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients, the results suggest that landiolol is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the well-known difficult condition of post-operative JET, and warrant further investigation in large-scale controlled studies </plain></SENT>
