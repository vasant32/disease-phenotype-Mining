<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> occur in dose-related manner and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> dose given by metered-dose inhaler (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi>) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> attack is commonly lower than the dose given by nebulizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> given by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> on QTd in the course of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two children, between 5-15 years of age, who were able to perform spirometric maneuvers and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> administration by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> through the spacer, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">Salbutamol</z:chebi> was administered at a dose of 50 µg/kg three times at 15-20 minute intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical features, spirometric parameters and QT measurements from the standard electrocardiograms were studied at baseline and 15 minute after the third inhalation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relation between the continuous variables was evaluated by using paired Student's t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, treatments were well-tolerated, significant improvement of pulmonary index scores and spirometric parameters were observed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between the pre and post-treatment values in QTd (30.4±5.6 ms; 33.7±6.2 ms, p=0.086) and corrected QTd (38.8±6.4 ms; 40.7±7.7 ms, p=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">Salbutamol</z:chebi> administered using metered dose inhaler showed satisfying clinical improvement with notably lower doses than the dose given by nebulizer and does not affect ventricular repolarization in children with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0347950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asthmatic attack</z:e> </plain></SENT>
