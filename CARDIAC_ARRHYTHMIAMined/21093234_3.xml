<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> are well characterized on post-ischemic heart and cardiomyocytes, its toxicity on extra-cardiac tissues is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we have monitored the cytotoxicity effects of this drug on three cultured cell lines including hepatocytes (HepG2), epithelial cells (EAhy 926) and renal cells (Vero) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on (i) cell viabilities, (ii) heat shock protein expressions (Hsp 70) as a parameter of protective and adaptive response and (iii) oxidative damage.Our results clearly showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> inhibits cell proliferation, induces an over-expression of Hsp 70 and generates significant amount of reactive oxygen species as measured by <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was significantly higher in renal and epithelial cells than in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vitamin E supplement restores the major part of cell mortalities induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> showing that oxidative damage is the predominant toxic effect of the drug.Except its toxicity for the cardiac system, our findings demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> can target other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, kidneys present a high sensibility to this drug which may limit its use with subjects suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851590" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
