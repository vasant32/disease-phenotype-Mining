<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the feasibility and superiority of an original <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> pinpoint pressing permeation (FPPP) method for building a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sinus node damage (CSND) model, 5 rabbits were chosen from 35 as a sham-operation group, and the remaining were randomly divided into two groups: the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> wet compressing (FWC) group, in which models were established by applying a cotton bud dipped in 20% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> onto the sinus node (SN) area, and the FPPP group, in which models were established by injecting <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> into the SN area through a self-made pinpointing and injecting electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that in both groups, the HR at 2 h, 24 h, 1 wk, and 2 wk after modeling decreased compared with premodeling; sinoatrial conduction time, sinus node recovery time, and corrected sinus node recovery time were prolonged compared with premodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indexes mentioned shortened by 2 wk after modeling compared with 2 h in the FWC group, whereas they were stable after modeling in the FPPP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The modeling achievement ratio in the FPPP group was higher and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under light microscope, paraffin sections of the SN tissue and cells showed severe injury in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the CSND models in rabbits can be successfully established by the FPPP method, with higher achievement ratio, lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, better stabilization effect, and less damaging comparing with the traditional method </plain></SENT>
