<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(DaSuan in Mandarin) is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used to prevent and heal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of allitridi (an active constituent of Allium sativum L.) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on the conduction system and on reverse use-dependence in the isolated hearts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats, with a ligated left anterior descending coronary artery, were used as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> models to investigate the biological effects of the traditional Chinese herb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single-phase electrode assay and isolated heart perfusion administration methods were employed to study and compare the electrophysiological effects of allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potential (MAP) in vitro, effective refractory period (ERP) and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD)/ERP were measured to investigate reverse use-dependence (RUD) with allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, bundle maps and heart rates were analyzed to evaluate the electrophysiological effects of allitridi on the conduction system of the cardiac muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coronary flow was used to study the beneficial effects of the two drugs on the bundle of His in myocardial infraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> can reduce the infarction model of the His bundle (A-H, H-V) conduction and cardiac sinus rhythm in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and isolated rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After washing in physiological solution (AK-H) for 15 min, the allitridi group partially recovered, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> group did not recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) Allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> had no significant effects on the change of MAPD(90) or ERP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MI rat hearts at different pacing frequencies (200, 250 and 300 beats/min), which indicated no RUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of allitridi on prolonging MAPD(90) and ERP were weaker than those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effects of allitridi on myocardial repolarization and its variation rate were also weaker than those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the prolonged administration of allitridi still did not cause RUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> can significantly increase the ERP/APD(90) rate of the isolated heart ventricles of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats and rats with MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We propose that allitridi and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> have similar effects on the cardiac conduction system and on the electrophysiology without RUD, which may be the result of the use of multi-channel blockers, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> and IKr and IKs channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Allitridi may be a promising antiarrythmic drug </plain></SENT>
