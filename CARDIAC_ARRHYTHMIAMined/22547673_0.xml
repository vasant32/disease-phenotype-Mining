<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The New York State Cardiac Surgery Reporting System was used to identify 8597 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery in July through December 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index was used to ascertain patients' vital statuses through December 31, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after CABG surgery using preprocedural risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, points were assigned to significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on the basis of the values of their regression coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each possible point total, the predicted risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at years 1, 3, 5, and 7 were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that the 7-year mortality rate was 24.2 in the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included age, body mass index, ejection fraction, unstable hemodynamic state or shock, left main <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, and history of open heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The points assigned to these risk factors ranged from 1 to 7; possible point totals for each patient ranged from 0 to 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed and predicted risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at years 1, 3, 5, and 7 across patient groups stratified by point totals were highly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The simplified risk score accurately predicted the risk of mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and can be used for informed consent and as an aid in determining treatment choice </plain></SENT>
