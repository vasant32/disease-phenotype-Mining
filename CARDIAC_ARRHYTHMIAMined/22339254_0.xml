<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A correct and complete thrombin inhibition has to be achieved early in this setting and is complementary with fast and potent antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has clearly shown to be an effective tool for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes managed invasively, contemporarily causing fewer hemorragies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its efficacy has been questioned, mostly in cases of inadequate platelet inhibition and during primary PCI if compared with therapy with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitors due to an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other modalities of infusion have been shown to improve the antithrombotic properties of bivalirudin, maintaining its safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we discuss on the most recent studies on this drug in the catheterization laboratory during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
