<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract  The Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd) G-protein-coupled receptor system, involving 19 distinct Wnt ligands and 10 Fzd receptors, plays key roles in the development and functioning of many organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that Wnt-Fzd signalling is important in regulating cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wnt-Fzd signalling primarily involves a canonical pathway, with dishevelled-1-dependent nuclear translocation of β-catenin that derepresses Wnt-sensitive gene transcription, but can also include non-canonical pathways via phospholipase-C/Ca(2+) mobilization and dishevelled-protein activation of small GTPases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wnt-Fzd effects vary with specific ligand/receptor interactions and associated downstream pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the biochemistry and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the Wnt-Fzd complex, and presents current knowledge of Wnt signalling in cardiac remodelling processes such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wnt signalling is activated during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>; inhibiting Wnt signalling by activating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase attenuates the hypertrophic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wnt signalling has complex and time-dependent actions <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e>, so that either beneficial or harmful effects might result from Wnt-directed interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stem cell biology, a promising area for therapeutic intervention, is highly regulated by Wnt signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Wnt system regulates fibroblast function, and is prominently altered in arrhythmogenic ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> involving excess deposition of fibroadipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wnt signalling controls connexin43 expression, thereby contributing to the regulation of cardiac electrical stability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although much has been learned about Wnt-Fzd signalling in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and infarction, its role is poorly understood for a broad range of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Much more needs to be learned for its contributions to be fully appreciated, and to permit more effective exploitation of its enormous potential in therapeutic development </plain></SENT>
