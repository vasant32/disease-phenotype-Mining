<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic therapy is much more difficult in patients with CKD, but the general principles are similar to those in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function - at first, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> should be found and eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also the choice of therapy is narrowed due to the altered pharmacokinetics of many drugs resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, neurotoxicity of certain drugs and their complex interactions </plain></SENT>
