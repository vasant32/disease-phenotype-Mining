<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas exercise training corrects abnormal cyclic Ca(2+) handling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, the effect on diastolic Ca(2+) remains unstudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the effect of exercise training on the generation and propagation of spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) waves in failing cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by coronary artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography confirmed left ventricular infarctions of 40 ± 5%, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was indicated by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, decreased contraction-relaxation rates, and pathological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous Ca(2+) waves were imaged by laser linescanning confocal microscopy (488 nm excitation/505-530 nm emission) in 2 µM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5107">Fluo-3</z:chebi>-loaded cardiomyocytes at 37°C and extracellular Ca(2+) of 1.2 and 5.0 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies showed that spontaneous Ca(2+) wave frequency was higher at 5.0 mM than 1.2 mM extracellular Ca(2+) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats, but failing cardiomyocytes generated 50% (P &lt; 0.01) more waves compared to sham-operated controls at Ca(2+) 1.2 and 5.0 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise training reduced the frequency of spontaneous waves at both 1.2 and 5.0 mM Ca(2+) (P &lt; 0.05), although complete normalization was not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise training also increased the aborted/completed ratio of waves at 1.2 mM Ca(2+) (P &lt; 0.01), but not 5.0 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we repeated these studies after inhibiting the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differential effects were found; thus, mediation did not involve the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, exercise training improved the cardiomyocyte control of diastolic Ca(2+) by reducing the Ca(2+) wave frequency and by improving the ability to abort spontaneous Ca(2+) waves after their generation, but before cell-wide propagation </plain></SENT>
