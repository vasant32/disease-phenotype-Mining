<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a number of studies have reported that 123I-MIBG imaging provides powerful diagnostic and prognostic information in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardiovascular predictive value of cardiac 123I-MIBG imaging in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 123I-MIBG imaging at 30 min (early) and 240 min (delayed) after the tracer injection, and clinical parameters were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 27 ± 12 months, 5 patients required hospitalization for HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo>, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(123)I-MIBG delayed heart to mediastinal ratio (delayed H/M) was lower and washout rate (WR) was higher in HF patients than non-HF patients (1.62 ± 0.21 vs. 1.34 ± 0.08, p = 0.019; 31.9 ± 5.5 vs. 38.2 ± 3.3, p = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both WR and delayed H/M did not correlate with Hoehn and Yahr stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The WR showed a weak negative correlation with delayed H/M (R = -0.357, p &lt; 0.001) upon simple linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that WR and delayed H/M were independently associated with HF (p = 0.014, p = 0.029, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with abnormal WR (&gt; 37%) and delayed H/M (&lt; 1.48) had a higher incidence of HF than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> WR and delayed H/M (p = 0.014, p = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: WR showed stronger predictive power than delayed H/M in Kaplan-Meier analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>WR has more useful cardiovascular predictive value than delayed H/M in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify the significance of abnormal MIBG uptake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
