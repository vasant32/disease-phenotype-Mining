<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even though its value has been questioned, inducibility of VTs/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> is widely used to select candidates to receive a prophylactic implantable defibrillator, and its accuracy has never been addressed in prospective studies with homogeneous enrolling criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a spontaneous or drug-induced type I electrocardiogram (ECG) and without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The registry included 308 consecutive individuals (247 men, 80%; median age 44 years, range 18 to 72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Programmed electrical stimulation was performed at enrollment, and patients were followed-up every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 34 months, 14 arrhythmic events (4.5%) occurred (13 appropriate shocks of the implantable defibrillator, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Programmed electrical stimulation performed with a uniform and pre-specified protocol induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 40% of patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility was not a predictor of events at follow-up (9 of 14 events occurred in noninducible patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and spontaneous type I ECG (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.20), ventricular refractory period &lt;200 ms (HR: 3.91), and QRS fragmentation (HR: 4.94) were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> inducibility is unable to identify high-risk patients, whereas the presence of a spontaneous type I ECG, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, ventricular effective refractory period &lt;200 ms, and QRS fragmentation seem useful to identify candidates for prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator </plain></SENT>
