<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results show that the golden section approach always finds the correction factor making QTc interval uncorrelated to heart rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the correction formulas derived from mixed model sometimes fail to make QTc interval invariant of heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The performance of an individual least-square regression method lies between the golden section iteration approach and the mixed model in terms of QTc-RR relationship </plain></SENT>
