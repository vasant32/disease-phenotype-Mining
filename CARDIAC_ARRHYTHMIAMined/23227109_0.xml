<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Key aspects of cardiac electrophysiology, such as slow conduction, conduction block, and saltatory effects have been the research topic of many studies since they are strongly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, reentry, <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, or defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to reproduce these phenomena the numerical models need to use subcellular discretization for the solution of the PDEs and nonuniform, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> tissue electric conductivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the high computational costs of simulations that reproduce the fine microstructure of cardiac tissue, previous studies have considered tissue experiments of small or moderate sizes and used simple cardiac cell models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we develop a cardiac electrophysiology model that captures the microstructure of cardiac tissue by using a very fine spatial discretization (8 μm) and uses a very modern and complex cell model based on Markov chains for the characterization of ion channel's structure and dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To cope with the computational challenges, the model was parallelized using a hybrid approach: cluster computing and GPGPUs (general-purpose computing on graphics processing units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our parallel implementation of this model using a multi-GPU platform was able to reduce the execution times of the simulations from more than 6 days (on a single processor) to 21 minutes (on a small 8-node cluster equipped with 16 GPUs, i.e., 2 GPUs per node) </plain></SENT>
