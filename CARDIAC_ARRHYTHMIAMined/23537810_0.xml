<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> influences endothelial function, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, blood pressure, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but a direct relation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) risk has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively examined the association between dietary and plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and risk of CHD among women in the Nurses' Health Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was examined among 86 323 women free of disease in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and lifestyle factors was ascertained every 2 to 4 years through questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through 2008, 3614 cases of CHD (2511 nonfatal/1103 fatal) were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, we conducted a nested case-control analysis, with 458 cases of incident CHD (400 nonfatal/58 fatal) matched to controls (1:1) on age, smoking, fasting status, and date of blood sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was not associated with lower risk of total CHD (P-linear trend=0.12) or nonfatal CHD (P-linear trend=0.88) in multivariable models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was inversely associated with risk of fatal CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RR comparing quintile 5 to quintile 1 of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P-linear trend=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake and risk of fatal CHD appeared to be mediated partially by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> levels above 2.0 mg/dL were associated with lower risk of CHD, although not independent of other cardiovascular biomarkers (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dietary and plasma <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> were not associated with total CHD incidence in this population of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake was inversely associated with fatal CHD, which may be mediated in part by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
