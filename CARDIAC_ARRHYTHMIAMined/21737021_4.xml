<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: J-point elevation is now known to be associated with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this early repolarization phenomenon is an inherited trait responsible for a proportion of otherwise unexplained SADS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Families of SADS probands were evaluated in an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were analyzed for J-point elevation defined as &gt;0.1 mV from baseline present in 2 or more of the inferior (II, III, and aVF) or lateral (1, aVL, V(4) to V(6)) leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic data were compared with those of 359 controls of a similar age, sex, and ethnic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 363 first-degree relatives from 144 families were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>J-point elevation in the inferolateral leads was present in 23% of relatives and 11% of control subjects (odds ratio: 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.66 to 3.90; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: J-point elevation is more prevalent in the relatives of SADS probands than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates that early repolarization is an important potentially inheritable pro-arrhythmic trait or marker of pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in SADS </plain></SENT>
