<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients over 80 years of age, the prevalence rises to approximately 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is associated with serious health implications, including a 2-fold increase in mortality risk and a 5-fold increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these facts, the current guidelines on the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) contain only a short paragraph on these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many relevant clinical aspects go without any comment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of our paper is to discuss those special needs of geriatric patients and their physicians which are not mentioned in the guidelines of the ESC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our review, we discuss rhythm versus rate control, oral anticoagulation, outcome, prevention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, adherence, polypharmacy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, nursing home patients, frailty, and geriatric assessment in consideration of geriatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An extended search of the literature on Pubmed served as the basis for this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individual aspects of each geriatric patient should be considered when managing these complex patients; however, the complexity of each case must not lead to an individualized therapy that is not in accordance with current guidelines and the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large number of papers which help us to answer most of the clinical questions regarding the management of trial <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> in geriatric patients have already been published </plain></SENT>
