<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, PLSVC with absent RSVC (isolated PLSVC) is a very rare venous malformation We report on a rare case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005301'>persistent left superior vena cava</z:hpo> (PLSVC) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011666'>absent right superior vena cava</z:hpo> (RSVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This venous malformation was identified incidentally in a 69-year-old woman during chest multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On chest MDCT, the SVC was noted on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A bridging vein drained the right jugular and right subclavian veins and joined the left brachiocephalic vein in order to form the PLSVC, which descended on the left side of the mediastinum and drained into the left atrium (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had no additional cardiac anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated PLSVC is usually asymptomatic but it can pose difficulties for establishing central venous access, pacemaker implantation and cardiothoracic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This condition is also associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and conduction disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A wide spectrum of clinicians should be aware of this anomaly, its variations and possible complications </plain></SENT>
