<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation, and its impairment is an independent prognostic indicator for cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate HRR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population included 56 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (23 men, mean age = 47.3 ± 13.0 years, and mean disease duration = 38.4 ± 9.7 months) and 54 healthy control subjects (20 men, mean age = 46.5 ± 12.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal ECG, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HRR index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate at peak exercise to the first-minute rate (HRR(1)), second-minute (HRR(2)), third-minute (HRR(3)), and fifth-minute (HRR(5)) after the cessation of exercise stress testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There are significant differences in HRR(1) and HRR(2) indices between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> and the control group (25 ± 6 vs 34 ± 11; P &lt; .001 and 45 ± 10 vs 53 ± 12; P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, HRR(3) and HRR(5) indices of the recovery period were lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> when compared with indices in the control group (53 ± 12 vs 61 ± 13; P &lt; .001 and 60 ± 13 vs 68 ± 13; P &lt; .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise capacity was notably lower (9.2 ± 2.1 vs 11.6 ± 2.8 METs; P = .001, respectively) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure at rest was significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> compared with the control group (29.7 ± 5.5 mm Hg vs 25.6 ± 5.7 mm Hg, P = .001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HRR indices were found to be different among radiographic stage groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HRR index was impaired in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> as compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the prognostic significance of the HRR index is considered, these results may partially explain the increased occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the HRR index may be clinically helpful in identifying high-risk patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
