<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence has indicated that hereditary defects are implicated in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and the genetic etiology of AF in a significant portion of patients remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the GATA6 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor crucial for cardiogenesis, were sequenced in 140 unrelated patients with lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the index patient carrying an identified mutation and 200 unrelated ethnically-matched healthy individuals used as the controls were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional characteristics of the mutant GATA6 were assessed in contrast to its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, a novel heterozygous GATA6 mutation, p.G469V, was identified in a family with AF inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was absent in the 200 control individuals and the altered amino acid was completely conserved across species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis demonstrated that the GATA6 mutation was associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of AF, as well as insight into potential therapies for the prevention and treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
