<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation is routinely used to treat numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating in the atrium and the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The process of ablation was pioneered to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> originating from fixed electrical circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These circuits could be identified using innovative electrophysiological maneuvers, which have been refined over the years to achieve excellent cure rates using fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, electrophysiology ablation procedures have been greatly expanded to treat more diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> that are sustained by a remodeled myocardium or scar tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given that there is no fixed circuit to target during most of these ablations, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, there is a need to better visualize the substrate or the remodeling in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, when ablating <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, it is routine to use a cardiac CT or intra-cardiac echocardiogram to provide a three-dimensional anatomical structural map of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach does not provide any substrate information like <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> or scar tissue in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI has excellent soft-tissue visualization characteristics and has been used extensively to characterize the myocardial tissue as scar or <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This structural remodeling information of the myocardium is increasingly being used, along with the three-dimensional structural information in the ablation procedures, with the goal of improving the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition MRI can also be used to visualize radiofrequency ablation lesions, potentially leading to significant improvement in procedural outcomes </plain></SENT>
