<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the incidence and timing of reactive pericardial collections developing after left atrial catheter ablation (LACA), and when and if transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed routinely in these patients postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred consecutive LACA patients for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) (107), paroxysmal AF (75) or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) (18) underwent on-table TTE at the end of the procedure, and the next day prior to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient developed tamponade at the time of transseptal puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of the remaining 199 who underwent on-table TTE, had a pericardial collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On next day TTE, there were significantly more pericardial collections (53%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent rather than paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at the time of the procedure was the only predictor of a pericardial collection, either on-table (χ(2)= 9.64; P = 0.002) or next day (χ(2)= 5.95; P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had collections on next day TTE ≥ 1.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One needed drainage because of clinical tamponade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeated TTEs in the other 7 patients demonstrated resolution of collections over 1-2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pericardial collections are common in LACA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are not associated with clinical compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only predictor of collection size is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> type at ablation, which may correspond to ablation at sites specific to persistent rather than paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Performing on-table TTE routinely may help guide immediate anticoagulation protocols, but even larger on-table collections are not associated with tamponade and resolve spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TTE does not need to be performed routinely unless there are clinical signs of tamponade </plain></SENT>
