<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether baseline clinical factors, N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) levels and electrocardiographic patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340305" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="imi">inferior MI</z:e> are associated with greater risk of developing complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (CAVB) and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients (52 male, 27 female with an avarage age of 64.2 ± 10.9 years) with CAVB and 119 control patients (93 male, 16 female with an average age of 57.7 ± 11.4 years) without CAVB were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis revealed that NT-proBNP levels 〉 104 pg/mL increased the development of CAVB by 16.7 folds, 〉 1 mm ST elevation in RV4 by 2.7 folds, ratio of elevation in lead III:II 〉 1.5 by 10.1 folds but the thrombolytic therapy decreased the development of CAVB by 2.8 folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP 〉 92 pg/mL increased the mortality by 8.9 folds, a ratio of ST-segment elevation in lead III:II 〉 1 by 3.1 folds, ST segment elevation 〉 1 mm in RV4 by 3.5 folds, ejection fraction 〈 35% by 24.2 folds, age 〉 65 years by 8.3 folds and CAVB by 6.8 folds, on contrary thrombolytic treatment decreased the mortality by 3.3 folds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simple electrocardiographic measurements and NT-proBNP levels at admission can be used as a screening test for development of complications such as CAVB, right ventricular involvement and mortality during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inferior wall MI </plain></SENT>
