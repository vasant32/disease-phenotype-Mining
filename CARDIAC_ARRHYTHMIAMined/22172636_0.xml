<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias remains a major mode of mortality in patients with systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the association of nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with low ejection fraction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We incorporated a large number of known pathophysiologic triggers to identify potential targets for therapy to reduce the persistently high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in this population despite contemporary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-six ambulatory male patients with stable low (≤ 45%) ejection fraction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> underwent full-night attendant polysomnography and simultaneous Holter recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of couplets (paired premature ventricular excitations) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) (at least three consecutive premature ventricular excitations) during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multiple regression analysis, four variables (current smoking status, increased number of arousals, plasma alkalinity, and old age) were associated with VT and two variables (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index and low right ventricular ejection fraction) were associated with couplets during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that cessation of smoking, effective treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>, and plasma <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> could collectively decrease the incidence of nocturnal ventricular tachyarrhythmias and the consequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, which remains high despite the use of β blockades </plain></SENT>
