<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although catheter ablation is an effective treatment for typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (TFL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> may occur during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of postablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> before TFL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-two patients (135 men, age 68 ± 9 years) ablated for TFL were divided into two groups: group 1 (80 patients) with isolated TFL and group 2 (112 patients) with TFL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> before ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end-point of the study was the occurrence of documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several predetermined variables were tested with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' perception of the frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms was evaluated before and after ablation by means of the Symptom Checklist Frequency and Severity scale (SCFSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was recorded in 18 (22.5%) group 1 and 52 (46%) group 2 patients (P = 0.001), during a follow-up of 1086 ± 825 and 1126 ± 962 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurrence in group 1 were the number of preablation episodes of TFL and the younger age of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 37 group 2 patients who continued to have paroxysmal or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes after ablation showed a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> incidence and hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SCFSS significantly improved in the 63 group 2 patients in whom it was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On long-term follow-up, after ablation of isolated TFL, more than three-quarters of patients remained free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in patients with preablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, TFL ablation reduced the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes as well as the number of hospitalizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms </plain></SENT>
