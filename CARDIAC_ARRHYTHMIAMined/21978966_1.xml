<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inappropriate therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> remains a significant source of morbidity in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Rhythm ID Goes Head to Head Trial (RIGHT) was designed to compare rhythm discrimination and inappropriate therapies among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> from 2 manufacturers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> indications were randomized to receive a Guidant VITALITY 2 with Rhythm ID or selective Medtronic pulse generators using the Enhanced PR Logic or Wavelet discrimination algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single- or dual-chamber device was implanted based on clinical indications and programmed in 2 detection zones with detection enhancements enabled for rates between 150 and 200 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Algorithm performance was compared between randomization groups, stratified by single or dual chamber, for the primary end point of first inappropriate therapy (shock or antitachycardia pacing) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1962 patients enrolled and followed for 18.3 Â± 9.2 months, with no difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 3973 treated episodes where electrograms were available and adjudicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of inappropriate therapy occurred in 246 of 985 VITALITY 2 patients vs 187 of 977 specific Medtronic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients (hazard ratio = 1.34; confidence interval = 1.11-1.62; P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences in inappropriate therapy were confined to single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate shocks were more frequent in VITALITY 2 ICDs (hazard ratio = 1.63; confidence interval = 1.29-2.06; P &lt; .001), with most therapies and performance differences occurring at slower rhythms (rates &lt; 175 bpm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rhythm discrimination performed better in the specific Medtronic than in VITALITY 2 ICDs evaluated, particularly for single-chamber devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate therapies, and differences in performance, may be reduced with the use of rate cutoff above 175 bpm </plain></SENT>
