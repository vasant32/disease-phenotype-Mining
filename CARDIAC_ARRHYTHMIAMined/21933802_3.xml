<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous atrial diagnostics, through home monitoring (HM) technology (BIOTRONIK, Berlin, Germany), provides a unique opportunity to assess frequency and quantity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) episodes defined as atrial high-rate events (AHRE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective data from 560 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients (age 67 ± 10 years, median ejection fraction 27%) patients with a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device capable of HM from two multi-centre studies were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atrial high-rate events burden was defined as the duration of mode switch in a 24-h period with atrial rates of &gt;180 beats for at least 1% or total of 14 min per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was incidence of a thromboembolic (TE) event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, hospitalization because of AF, or worsening HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a median 370-day follow-up AHRE occurred in 40% of patients with 11 (2%) patients developing TE complications and mortality rate of 4.3% (24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 16 with cardiovascular aetiology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without detected AHRE, patients with detected AHRE&gt;3.8 h over a day were nine times more likely to develop TE complications (P= 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (73%) did not show a temporal association with the detected atrial episode and their adverse event, with a mean interval of 46.7 ± 71.9 days (range 0-194) before the TE complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a high-risk cohort of HF patients, device-detected atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are associated with an increased incidence of TE events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A cut-off point of 3.8 h over 24 h was associated with significant increase in the event rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Routine assessment of AHRE should be considered with other data when assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and considering anti-coagulation initiation and should also prompt the optimization of cardioprotective HF therapy in CRT patients </plain></SENT>
