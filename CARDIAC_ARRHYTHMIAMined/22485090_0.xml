<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent randomized controlled trials challenge the efficacy of the additional application of Ω-3 and its anti-arrhythmic effect under certain clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present paper reflects the results of earlier and recent clinical studies with respect to the individual background conditions that may determine the clinical outcome of Ω-3 supplementation and thereby explain apparently conflicting clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the efficacy of Ω-3 supplementation to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> strongly depends on the underlying clinical and pharmacological conditions, a hypothesis that also is supported by data from experimental animal studies and by molecular interactions of Ω-3 at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
