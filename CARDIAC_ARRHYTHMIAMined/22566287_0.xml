<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients suffering from PCD have low <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels and can present with metabolic and/or cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45133">Pivalic acid</z:chebi> exposure decreases <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the association and pathophysiology of exposure to antibiotics containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45133">pivalic acid</z:chebi> and severe neurological and cardiac complications in six identified subjects suffering from PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six cases of PCD were identified and studied through medical records and family interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stored biomaterial was analyzed for mutations causing PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients (two children, three adults) died suddenly while one adult patient survived sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was documented in five patients, while one patient was not monitored at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but had signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> a few days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autopsy showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in four out of five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One subject had a <z:mp ids='MP_0004937'>dilated heart</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were homozygous for the c.95A&gt;G (p.N32S) mutation in SLC22A5 causing PCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been treated with antibiotics containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45133">pivalic acid</z:chebi> prior to the episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Exposure to antibiotics containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45133">pivalic acid</z:chebi> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and progression to lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in patients suffering from PCD </plain></SENT>
