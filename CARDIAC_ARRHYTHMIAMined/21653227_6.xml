<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In subphysiological extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]o), which occur in pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, the resting membrane potential of human cardiomyocytes can depolarize to around -50 mV, whereas rat and mouse cardiomyocytes become hyperpolarized, consistent with the Nernst equation for K+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paradoxical depolarization of cardiomyocytes in subphysiological [K+]o, which may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, is thought to involve an inward leak <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>) current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that human cardiac TWIK-1 (also known as K2P1) two-pore domain K+ channels change ion selectivity, becoming permeable to external <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, and conduct inward leak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> currents in subphysiological [K+]o </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32835">threonine residue</z:chebi> (Thr118) within the pore selectivity sequence TxGYG was required for this altered ion selectivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse cardiomyocyte-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cells exhibited paradoxical depolarization with ectopic expression of TWIK-1 channels, whereas TWIK-1 knockdown in human spherical primary cardiac myocytes eliminated paradoxical depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that ion selectivity of TWIK-1 K+ channels changes during pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, elucidate a molecular basis for inward leak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> currents that could trigger or contribute to cardiac paradoxical depolarization in lowered [K+]o, and identify a mechanism for regulating cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
