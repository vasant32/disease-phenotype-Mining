<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin (Ang) A was first identified in human plasma and it differs from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> in Ala(1) instead of Asp(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we hypothesized that the actions of this <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> might explain, at least partially, the limited effects of AT(1)R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of Ang A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> on blood pressure (BP) and heart function were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, participation of AT(1)R in these effects was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of these two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and involvement of calcium in these effects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of increasing doses of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> caused elevations in BP at comparable magnitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AT(1)R blockade completely abolished these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The actions of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in cardiac function were quite similar although the effects of Ang A were only partially blocked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> elicited an increase in the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> while Ang A had no effect on cardiac rhythm during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In accordance, differently to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>, Ang A did not induce any significant effect on calcium transient during baseline and ischemic stress conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the existence of alternative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) might contribute to the limited effects of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in certain pathophysiological circumstances </plain></SENT>
