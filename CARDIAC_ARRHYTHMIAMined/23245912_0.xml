<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These channels are formed by oligomerization of individual protein subunits known as connexins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In response to a broad array of pathologic stressors, gap junction expression is disturbed, resulting in aberrant cardiac conduction and increased propensity for rhythm disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review some of the recently identified molecular regulators of connexin assembly, membrane targeting, and degradation, focusing on the role of post-translational phosphorylation of connexin 43, the major gap junctional protein expressed in ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also describe efforts to engineer "designer" gap junctions that are resistant to pathologic remodeling </plain></SENT>
