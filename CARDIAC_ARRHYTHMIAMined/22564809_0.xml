<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical risk of the redo procedure is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our recent experience with patients submitted to this surgery under such conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 1999 to July 2010, 51 patients (mean age, 70.3 ± 7.0 years, 86.3% male) submitted to CABG previously required aortic valve surgery (AVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the surgeries was 7.1 ± 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (41.2%) had also undergone AVS during the first surgery [12 patients (57.7%) had valve replacement and 9 patients (42.8%) had valvuloplasty] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At presentation, 51.0% were in New York Heart Association Class III/IV and the standard and logistic EuroSCOREs were 10.1 ± 2.5 and 20.9 ± 16.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic valve replacement was performed in 48 patients (94.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had undergone a surgery for the closure of a peri-prosthetic leak and one patient a valvuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (25.5%) needed to undergo additional cardiac procedures, including root enlargement (three patients, 5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Valve surgery was performed with non-dissection of the internal thoracic artery graft, when patented, and antegrade cardioplegic arrest of other territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital and 30-day mortality rate was 2% (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of hospital stay was 13.0 ± 11.1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most frequent complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> - in 25.5% of the patients, and mostly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (19.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Permanent pacemaker for A-V block was required in 5.9% of the cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was documented in two cases (3.9%) and early re-intervention was observed in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Redo AVS performed in patients submitted to CABG previously results in mortality and morbidity rates that are much lower than what is expected, bringing clear benefits to the patients </plain></SENT>
