<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of resistant AF, which developed in young healthy manual laborers shortly after inhalational lung injury due to massive quantity of pesticides and anhydrous ammonia, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had no evidence of valvular or structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and did not have any previous medical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AF was resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and required pulmonary vein isolation in first patient and possibly the second patient who is currently being evaluated for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> may reflect direct myocardial injury during and after exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, multiple mechanisms can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung diseases</z:e>, including hypoxemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, and structural changes in the atria and ventricle, and these could lead to AF in inhalational lung injury cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF needs to be excluded when patients present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> after inhalational lung injury, especially since, if unrecognized, AF may lead to complications, like thromboembolic phenomenon and tachycardiomyopathy </plain></SENT>
