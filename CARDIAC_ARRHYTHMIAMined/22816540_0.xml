<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combined influence of different variables, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and physical fitness status, on the T-wave amplitude has not been evaluated to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect the T-wave amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 255 consecutive apparently healthy individuals included in the Tel Aviv Medical Center <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> Survey (TAMCIS) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone a physical examination and an exercise stress test, and different inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers (fibrinogen, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate stepwise analysis revealed that the body mass index and the resting heart rate were significantly associated with the T-wave amplitude (β=-0.34, P &lt; 0.001; β=-0.19, P = 0.03, respectively) in males, while the recovery rate and the usage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> significantly affected the T-wave amplitude in females (β= 0.36, P = 0.002; β= 0.35, P = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory variables had no significant affect on the T-wave amplitude of either gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the T-wave amplitude is linked to an individual's physical fitness and not to his/her inflammatory status </plain></SENT>
