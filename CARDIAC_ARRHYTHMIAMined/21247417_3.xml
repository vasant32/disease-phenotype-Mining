<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in children related to high <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> consumption have not been well described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case series describes the possible association between the consumption of highly caffeinated drinks and the subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the adolescent population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATIONS: We report the cases of two Caucasian adolescent boys of 14 and 16 years of age at the time of presentation, each without a significant cardiac history, who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> or vague chest discomfort or both after a recent history of excessive <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> on electrocardiogram; one patient required digoxin to restore a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm, and the other self-converted after intravenous fluid administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the increasing popularity of energy drinks in the pediatric and adolescent population, physicians should be aware of the arrhythmogenic potential associated with highly caffeinated beverage consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is important for pediatricians to understand the lack of regulation in the <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> content and other ingredients of these high-energy beverages and their complications so that parents and children can be educated about the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> with excessive energy drink consumption </plain></SENT>
