<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drugs that prevent Ca(2+) waves may have antiarrhythmic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we use permeabilized ventricular myocytes from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mouse model lacking calsequestrin (casq2) to screen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinically available class I antiarrhythmic drugs and selected other antiarrhythmic agents for activity against Ca(2+) waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Casq2-/- myocytes were imaged in line-scan mode and the following Ca(2+) wave parameters analyzed: wave incidence, amplitude, frequency, and propagation speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IC(50) (potency) and maximum inhibition (efficacy) were calculated for each drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Drugs fell into 3 distinct categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Category 1 drugs (flecainide and R-propafenone) suppressed wave parameters with the highest potency (IC(50)&lt;10 μM) and efficacy (&gt;50% maximum wave inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Category 2 drugs (encainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>) had intermediate potency (IC(50) 20-40 μM) and efficacy (20-40% maximum wave inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Category 3 drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4657">disopyramide</z:chebi>, mexiletine, cibenzoline, and ranolazine) had no significant effects on Ca(2+) waves at the highest concentration tested (100 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Propafenone was stereoselective, with R-propafenone suppressing waves more potently than S-propafenone (IC(50): R-propafenone 2 ± 0.2 μM vs. S-propafenone 54 ± 18 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both flecainide and R-propafenone decreased Ca(2+) spark mass and converted propagated Ca(2+) waves into non-propagated wavelets and frequent sparks, suggesting that reduction in spark mass, not spark frequency, was responsible for wave suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> class I antiarrhythmic drugs, flecainide and R-propafenone inhibit Ca(2+) waves with the highest potency and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Permeabilized casq2-/- myocytes are a simple in-vitro assay for finding drugs with activity against Ca(2+) waves </plain></SENT>
