<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the prevalence and prognostic significance of ER in patients with vasospastic <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the ER pattern in 281 VA patients (mean age, 50.5±7.9years), and the prognostic modulation of ER-associated risk by ST-segment variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Any type of ER≥0.1mV in inferior and/or lateral leads was persistently observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> in 60 (21.4%) VA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow up period of 7.6±4.7years, patients with ER had higher incidence of cardiac events including cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> than those with no ER (20.0% vs. 5.4%, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with ER≥0.1mV and horizontal/descending ST variant (n=18) had an increased age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of cardiac events (relative risk 8.12; 95% confidence interval 3.45-19.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When modeled for ER in inferior leads and horizontal/descending ST-segment variant, the hazard ratio of cardiac events increased to 8.89 (95% confidence interval 3.78-20.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in subjects with ascending ST variant, the relative risk for arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ER was observed in a fifth of VA patients, and was associated with an increased risk of cardiac events in VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it is also possible that, in patients with ER, VA might cause an adverse event or facilitate the diagnosis of ER </plain></SENT>
