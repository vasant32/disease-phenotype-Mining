<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathologic and electrophysiological substrate implicated to arrhythmogenesis has been quite adequately defined over the last decades and multiple forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> - diffuse, patchy or gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> - are being studied regarding their arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the recent demonstration and continuous expansion of knowledge regarding causative genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> open a new chapter in the field of diagnosis and prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerous noninvasive and invasive methods have been used to stratify patients according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> level of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severely reduced left ventricular systolic myocardial function, expressed mostly by left ventricular ejection function, NYHA functional class, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and invasive electrophysiological study with programmed electrical stimulation have been incorporated into international guidelines, though leaving significant proportions of primary prevention patients out of stratification schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic markers, signal-averaged ECG, heart rate variability, heart rate turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate recovery and T-wave alternans have given conflicting results in non ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, cardiac magnetic resonance, especially with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement, has made a step forward in defining the fibrotic substrate of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies have given promising results, demonstrating correlation between late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement and ventricular arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification of patients with genetically caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and large prospective trials investigating cardiac magnetic resonance and its prognostic potential may be able to establish a new era in stratification schemes </plain></SENT>
