<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The questionnaire was sent to Danish hospitals treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To illustrate potential changes in the indications for TP, the questionnaire included two case reports also used in 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three of 39 hospitals returned the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (94%) were able to perform transcutaneous TP, and 20 (61%) had access to transvenous TP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcutaneous TP was preferred in five hospitals, and transvenous TP was the procedure of choice in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1986, 13 of 74 (18%) hospitals were able to perform transcutaneous TP, and 33 of 74 (45%) had access to transvenous TP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over the two decades, the proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> undergoing TP decreased from 3.7% to 0.7% (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found with regard to the indications for TP except for patients with posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> complicated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>third degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in whom a higher rate of TP was found (85%) compared with the 1986 results (56%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of hospitals with TP facilities has nearly doubled since 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over the same time period, the number of Danes undergoing TP in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At present, TP is being performed in less than 1% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
