<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to characterize electrocardiographic and electrophysiological features and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) outcomes in patients with focal AT originating from the LAAd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourteen patients (2.1%) (mean age, 25 ± 10 years; nine women; mean symptom duration, 5 ± 5 years) undergoing RFA of focal AT originating from the LAAd were included out of 668 RFA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation mapping was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P waves were classified as negative, positive, isoelectric, or biphasic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>Tachycardia</z:hpo> that was incessant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, demonstrated a characteristic P-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and endocardial activation pattern: P wave was negative in leads I and aVL, highly positive in the inferior leads, and broad and positive in lead V₁ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was acutely successful in 13 of 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The endocardial activation time of the successful RFA sites was 47.1 ± 4.3 ms before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of P wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no complications in any of the 14 patients and long-term success was achieved in 13 of 13 successful RFA patients during follow-up (5 ± 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The LAAd is an uncommon site of origin for focal AT (2.1% incidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case series, focal ATs originating from the LAAd had typical electrophysiological and electrocardiographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Focal ablation yielded high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate with low rate of recurrence during follow-up </plain></SENT>
