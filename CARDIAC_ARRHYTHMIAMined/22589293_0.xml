<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations of KCNJ2, the gene encoding the human inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel Kir2.1, cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1563715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Andersen-Tawil syndrome</z:e> (ATS), a disease exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003768'>periodic paralysis</z:hpo>, and dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some KCNJ2 mutation carriers lack the ATS triad and sometimes share the phenotype of catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinical and biophysical characteristics of KCNJ2 mutation carriers with "atypical ATS." METHODS AND RESULTS: Mutational analyses of KCNJ2 were performed in 57 unrelated probands showing typical (≥2 ATS features) and atypical (only 1 of the ATS features or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) ATS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 24 mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation-positive rates were 75% (15/20) in typical ATS, 71% (5/7) in cardiac phenotype alone, 100% (2/2) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003768'>periodic paralysis</z:hpo>, and 7% (2/28) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We divided <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carriers (n=45, including family members) into 2 groups: typical ATS (A) (n=21, 47%) and atypical phenotype (B) (n=24, 53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in (A) had a longer QUc interval [(A): 695 ± 52 versus (B): 643 ± 35 ms] and higher U-wave amplitude (0.24 ± 0.07 versus 0.18 ± 0.08 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>C-terminal mutations were more frequent in (A) (85% versus 38%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in incidences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses of 4 mutations found in (B) revealed that R82Q, R82W, and G144D exerted strong dominant negative suppression (current reduction by 95%, 97%, and 96%, respectively, versus WT at -50 mV) and T305S moderate suppression (reduction by 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: KCNJ2 gene screening in atypical ATS phenotypes is of clinical importance because more than half of mutation carriers express atypical phenotypes, despite their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
