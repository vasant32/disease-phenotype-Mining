<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the cardiovascular effects of drugs used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) in children and adolescents treated in community care centers in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was an open, prospective, observational study of youth with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> treated with atomoxetine (ATX) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> (MPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment were performed at baseline and at regular intervals up to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By June 2010, 1758 youth were enrolled in the Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> National Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant increases were observed in cardiovascular measures: in the MPH group after 6 months in heart rate (+2.01, p = 0.01); in the ATX group after 6 months in diastolic pressure (+1.60, p = 0.01) and in heart rate (+2.93, p = 0.001), and after 12 months in heart rate (+3.26, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the baseline, 59 patients had an alteration of ECG during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although at 12 months, the probability of detecting an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> was higher in the MPH group than in the ATX group, only 2 out of 30 cases at 6 months with altered ECG were considered to have experienced serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case was treated with ATX and one with MPH, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was the detected abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with MPH and ATX in youth appears to have a small but significant impact on the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term impact of these medications is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several clinically meaningless ECG alterations were observed mostly in MPH-treated youth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest evaluating cardiovascular risks at baseline </plain></SENT>
