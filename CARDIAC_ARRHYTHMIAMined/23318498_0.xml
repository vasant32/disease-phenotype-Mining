<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The influence of intracellular renin injection on the electrical properties of the intact left ventricle from adult Sprague Dawley rat heart was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracellular renin injection was performed using intracellular microelectrodes filled with solution containing renin (120pM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pressure pulses (40-70psi) for short periods of time (20ms), were applied to the micropipette while recording the action potential simultaneously from the same fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that intracellular renin caused a depolarization of ventricular fibers of 7.3±2±mV (n=38) (4 animals) (P&lt;0.05) and a decrease of the action potential duration at 50% and at 90% repolarization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the refractoriness was significantly decreased with consequent generation of triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of intracellular renin was seen within 3min of enzyme injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The shortening of the action potential was related to an increase of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current which was measured in isolated ventricular myocytes before and after intracellular dialysis of renin (10(-9)M) using a voltage whole cell clamp configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> (10(-8)M) dialyzed together with renin (120pM) into the cell decreased drastically the effect of renin on <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increment of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current was also found when intracellular renin was dialyzed into cardiomyocytes exposed to Krebs solution containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> (10(-8)M) for 10min prior to renin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bis-1 which is a specific inhibitor of PKC, abolished the effect of intracellular renin on <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion: intracellular renin decreases the action potential duration and cardiac refractoriness in the intact left ventricle of adult Sprague Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The shortening of the action potential was related to an increase in total <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of renin on total <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> and by Bis-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Implication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> was discussed </plain></SENT>
