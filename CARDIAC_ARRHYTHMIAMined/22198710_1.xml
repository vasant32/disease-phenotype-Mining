<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The quantity of blood arriving at the left side of the heart oscillates throughout the breathing cycle due to the mechanics of breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurally regulated fluctuations in the length of the heart period act to dampen oscillations of the left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume entering the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reported that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume oscillations but not spectral frequency variability <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume measures can be used to estimate the breathing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated with the same recordings whether heart period oscillations or spectral heart rate variability measures could function as estimators of breathing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous 270 s cardiovascular recordings were obtained from 22 healthy adult volunteers in the supine and upright postures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breathing was recorded simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Breathing frequency and heart period oscillation frequency were calculated manually, while heart rate variability spectral maximums were obtained using heart rate variability software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These estimates were compared to the breathing frequency using the Bland-Altman agreement procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Estimates were required to be &lt; Â±10% (95% levels of agreement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 95% levels of agreement measures for the heart period oscillation frequency (supine: -27.7 to 52.0%, upright: -37.8 to 45.9%) and the heart rate variability spectral maximum estimates (supine: -48.7 to 26.5% and -56.4 to 62.7%, upright: -37.8 to 39.3%) exceeded 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple heart period oscillations were observed to occur during breathing cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both respiratory and non-respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed amongst healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This observation at least partly explains why heart period parameters and heart rate variability parameters are not reliable estimators of breathing frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In determining the validity of spectral heart rate variability measurements we suggest that it is the position of the spectral peaks and not the breathing frequency that should be the basis of decision making </plain></SENT>
