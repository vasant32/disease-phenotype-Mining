<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing age is a well-appreciated risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF/AFL) in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As more elderly patients undergo auto-HSCT, the risk of developing AF/AFL post transplant may also increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, few data evaluating other risk factors for the development of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to determine the incidence of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT and to determine the risk factors associated with the development of AF/AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed AF/AFL were compared with a group of patients who received auto-HSCT within the same time period (April 1999 to May 2005) and were within 5 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 516 patients who underwent auto-HSCT at the University of Nebraska Medical Center 44 (8.5%) developed AF/AFL at a median time of 4 days (range, days 1-9) following auto-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, risk factors for developing AF/AFL were older age, odds ratio and 95% CI of 1.14 (1.07-1.21), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated serum creatinine</z:hpo> level, 2.69 (1.00-7.22), history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 9.33 (3.01-28.99), and history of previous mediastinal irradiation, 11.12 (1.33-92.96).Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 10 December 2012; doi:10.1038/bmt.2012.253 </plain></SENT>
