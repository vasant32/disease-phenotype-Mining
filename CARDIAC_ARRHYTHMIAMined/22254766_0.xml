<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we introduce a remote health care system, which is composed of a wireless vital sensor, multiple receivers and a triage engine installed in a desktop personal computer (PC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middleware installed in the receiver, which was developed in C++, supports reliable data handling of vital data to the ethernet port </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the human interface of the triage engine, which was developed in JAVA, shows graphics on his/her ECG data, 3D acceleration data, body surface temperature data and behavior status in the display of the desktop PC and sends an urgent e-mail containing the display data to a pre-registered medical doctor when it detects the occurrence of an abnormal event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the triage engine, the lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection algorithm based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis can achieve 100 % sensitivity and 99.99 % specificity, and the behavior recognition algorithm based on the combination of the nearest neighbor method and the Naive Bayes method can achieve more than 71 % classification accuracy </plain></SENT>
