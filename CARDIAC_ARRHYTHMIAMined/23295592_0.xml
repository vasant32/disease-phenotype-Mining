<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 110 unrelated patients with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 200 unrelated, ethnically matched healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The entire coding region of the GATA5 gene was sequenced in 110 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the mutation carriers and 200 controls were subsequently genotyped for the identified mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of the mutated GATA5 was characterized using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous GATA5 mutations (p.Y138F and p.C210G) were identified in two of the 110 unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These missense mutations cosegregated with AF in the families and were absent in the 400 control chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cross-species alignment of GATA5 protein sequence showed that the altered amino acids were completely conserved evolutionarily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A functional analysis revealed that the mutant GATA5 proteins were associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activation when compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings expand the spectrum of GATA5 mutations linked to AF and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, suggesting potential implications for the early prophylaxis and personalized treatment of this common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
