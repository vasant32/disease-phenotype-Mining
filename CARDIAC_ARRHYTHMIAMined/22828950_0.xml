<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: It was a quasi-experimental study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants had to be conscious and have attained at least sixth-grade literacy level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned into an intervention group (n = 23; received 10-15 minutes TT), a placebo group (n = 23; received 10-15 minutes simulated touch), and a control group (n = 23; did not receive any therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected using Spielberger's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> test, cardiac dysrhythmia checklist, and vital signs recording sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were considered to be significant at Î± = .05 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Sixty-nine women ranging in age from 35 to 65 years participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TT significantly decreased state <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.0001 but not trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (p = .88), decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiac dysrhythmias p &lt; 0.0001 except <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> (p = .01), and regulated vital signs p &lt; 0.0001 in the intervention group versus placebo and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TT is an effective approach for managing state <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, regulating vital signs, and decreasing the incidence of cardiac dysrhythmia during stressful situations, such as cardiac catheterization, in Iranian cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
