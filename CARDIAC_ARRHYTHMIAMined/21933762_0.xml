<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) have a lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T peak-to-end (Tpe) interval and the Tpe/QT ratio represent novel markers of arrhythmic risk that possibly correspond to the spatial dispersion of ventricular repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the effect of gender on these indexes in patients with stable CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 119 patients (age 62 Â± 9 years, 85 men) with stable CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recorded the demographic and clinical characteristics as well as electrocardiographic indexes of repolarization, such as corrected QT interval (QTc), Tpe interval, and Tpe/QT ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QT interval was measured in each of the 12 leads while Tpe interval was measured in the precordial leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The QTc intervals were comparable between the 2 groups (389 [368-419] ms in men, 374 [348-421] ms in women; p=0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was observed with respect to Tpe (80 [58-86] ms in men vs. 48 [39-65] ms in women, p=0.008) and Tpe/QT ratio (0.20 [0.17-0.23] in men vs. 0.14 [0.12-0.22] in women, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with CAD have a lower Tpe interval and a lower Tpe/QT ratio compared to men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decreased dispersion of ventricular repolarization may contribute to the lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and SCD in women with CAD </plain></SENT>
