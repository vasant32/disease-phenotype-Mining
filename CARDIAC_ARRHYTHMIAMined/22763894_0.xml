<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IAB has been shown to have a strong correlation with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, left atrial enlargement, left atrial electromechanical dysfunction and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study sought to determine whether there was an increased incidence of IAB in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">occlusive mesenteric ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of patients admitted with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric ischemia</z:e> (AMeI) from January 2009 to March 2011 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-two out of 342 patients reviewed, qualified after excluding mechanical surgical obstruction, suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia</z:e> due to shock/hypoperfusion, and mesenteric <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 99 patients who were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm without prior history of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 88 (88.9 %) had IAB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was more than twice the average prevalence of IAB of two general hospital populations (41 % and 47 % as demonstrated by two previous studies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IAB may thus represent a novel risk factor for AMeI as it does for embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
