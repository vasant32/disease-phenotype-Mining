<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultra-high-density mapping with multielectrode catheters facilitates an accurate and faster definition of sites critical for re-entry, due to the possibility of simultaneous recordings of local potential from different pairs of electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multipolar catheters can be advanced to map the endocardial or the epicardial surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between the scar area determined by electroanatomical mapping and the histopathological scar size has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A double-transeptal technique allows for an accurate definition of target sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complex scar architecture has been investigated by ultra-high-density mapping, let the identification of islets of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> where electrograms adjacent to the preserved myocardium have an higher incidence of late potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pacing manoeuvres can easily be performed from any pair of electrode, to demonstrate the involvement of late potentials into the VT circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This strategy allows for a clear-cut validation of late potential abolishment, and may offer advantages to shorten procedural and fluoroscopy times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large series are necessary to definitively assess the potential role of multielectrode mapping as a guide for the substrate ablation approach in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> VT patients </plain></SENT>
