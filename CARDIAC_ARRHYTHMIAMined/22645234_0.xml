<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence and prognostic significance of high-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (HAVB) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients in the pPCI era has been only sparsely investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the incidence, predictors and prognostic significance of HAVB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients treated with pPCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 2073 STEMI patients treated with pPCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were identified through a hospital register and the Danish National Patient Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both registers were also used to establish the diagnosis of HAVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 2.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 1.8-4.0] 266 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was documented in 67 (3.2%) patients of whom 25 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant independent predictors of HAVB included right coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, age &gt;65 years, female gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mortality rate was significantly increased in patients with HAVB compared to patients without HAVB [hazard ratio = 3.14 (95% confidence interval 2.04-4.84), P&lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A landmark-analysis 30 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> showed equal mortality rates in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of HAVB in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients treated with pPCI has been reduced compared with reports from the thrombolytic era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, despite this improvement high-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> remains a severe prognostic marker in the pPCI era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was only increased within the first 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>High-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> patients who survived beyond this time-point thus had a prognosis equal to patients without HAVB </plain></SENT>
