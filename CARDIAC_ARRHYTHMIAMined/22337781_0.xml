<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mixture of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="17790">methanol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> was used to extract the samples, and the clear extracts obtained from the protein precipitation were injected directly onto an ethyl-linked <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> LC column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The isotope dilution technique was applied for quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative intralaboratory reproducibility standard deviations were 5-9% at a concentration range of 1-5 mg/L and 9-12% at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean true recoveries were greater than 91% in the concentration range of 0.05-5 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection limits were in the range of 8-18 Âµg/L </plain></SENT>
