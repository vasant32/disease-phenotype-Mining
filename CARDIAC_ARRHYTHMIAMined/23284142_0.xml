<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this cases series was to describe the association of various risk factors with total mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in this population.METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, [median: age 71.3 years [interquartile ratio (IQR) 62.9-76.6], <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> duration 3.0 years (IQR 1.3-7.8) and 64.8% male], of which 37.7% with ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, 41.8% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (DC), 84.4% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 27.1% with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60.0% (IQR 52-64) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was 147.3 g/m(2) (IQR 128.0-179.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QT interval duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) was measured by electrocardiogram Holter recording and considered prolonged when longer than 450 ms in men and 460 ms in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients (36.0%) had a prolonged QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Female gender (P &lt; 0.001) and DC (P = 0.018) were associated with a longer QTc, while LVEF (P = 0.012) was inversely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the study period (median follow-up 3.9 years), 51 patients died (41.8%), of whom 12 died for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis age at recruitment [HR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.11, P &lt; 0.001], prolonged QTc (HR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.20-3.91, P = 0.011) and presence of DC (HR = 3.75, 95% CI: 1.01-7.00, P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with total mortality, while only a prolonged QTc (HR = 8.33, 95% CI: 1.71-40.48, P = 0.009) and increasing LVMI (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, P = 0.022) were associated with SCD.CONCLUSIONS: In a case series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients, QTc was associated with total mortality and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies to test this hypothesis in a larger population are necessary </plain></SENT>
