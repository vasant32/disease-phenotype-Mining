<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further understand biologic mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e>, we examined the dark-enhanced startle response, a psychophysiological correlate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and heart rate variability (HRV) in traumatized individuals with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The associations of these measures with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> may be sex-specific because of their associations with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a sexually dimorphic brain structure in the limbic system that is approximately 2.5 times larger in men than in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample (N = 141) was recruited from a highly traumatized civilian population seeking treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Psychophysiological responses during a dark-enhanced startle paradigm task included startle magnitude, assessed by eyeblink reflex, and measures of high-frequency HRV, during light and dark phases of the startle session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The startle magnitude was higher during the dark phase than the light phase (mean ± standard error = 98.61 ± 10.68 versus 73.93 ± 8.21 μV, p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> was associated with a greater degree of dark-enhanced startle in women (p = .03) but not in men (p = .38, p interaction = .48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although HRV measures did not differ between phases, high-frequency HRV was greater in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> compared with men without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> (p = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the dark-enhanced paradigm provides novel insights into the psychophysiological responses associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> in traumatized civilian sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sex differences in altered parasympathetic and sympathetic function during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> regulation tasks may provide further insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTSD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
