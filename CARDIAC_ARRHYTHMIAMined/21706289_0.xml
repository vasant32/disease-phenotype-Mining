<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The purpose of this study is to assess whether OSA increases the risk of cardio-respiratory complications in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures with conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study over a 7-month period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients undergoing upper, lower, or combined endoscopy were asked to fill in the Berlin questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire was scored, and patients were classified as high or low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> based on the suggested scoring criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had previously undergone a sleep study were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Demographics and co-morbidities were identified from the electronic medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure type, amount of sedation, and minor and major complications were identified from the endoscopy flow sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The minor complications were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, hypoxemia, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005574'>bradypnea</z:mp> (respiratory rate &lt;8 breaths/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo>, and a minor complication that required a significant intervention, such as use of a reversal agent, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, up-titration of oxygen for hypoxemia, or prolonged observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedures were performed in 904 patients: colonoscopies, 68.0%; upper endoscopies, 22.8%; and combined procedures, 9.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five hundred fifty-three patients were identified as low risk (61.2%), and 351 were identified as high risk (38.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 59.5 ± 10.5 years, mean body mass index was 28.9 ± 6.6, mean neck circumference was 16.2 ± 6.3 in., and 91.4% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median Charlson co-morbidity index was 1 (25-75% percentage range 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received midazolam and fentanyl during endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The median and 25-75% range for midazolam and fentanyl dosages were 5 mg, 4-6 mg and 100 μg, 75-125 μg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Minor complications were observed in 10.56% of low-risk patients and 10.63% of high-risk patients (p = not significant (NS); odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Major complications were observed in 3.25% of low-risk patients and 1.9% of high-risk patients (p = ns; odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.26-1.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing endoscopy procedures under conscious sedation, the presence of OSA does not clearly increase the risk of cardiopulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
