<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we assessed RR and QT variability index (QTVI) at baseline during anger recall test (AR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated QTVI from a 5-min ECG recording and from a 10-beats segment around the presumed maximum sympathetic activation in thirty post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> patients under Î²-blocker therapy and 10 controls underwent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, the low-frequency component of RR and SBP increased during AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recordings, the QTVI calculated on a 5-min ECG recording and the QTVI(10 beats) were higher in patients than in controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QTVI during AR remained unchanged from baseline within each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, during AR, the QTVI(10 beats) in controls diminished significantly (P &lt; 0.05) from baseline whereas in patients remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inability to buffer an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress-induced increase in sympathetic activity could explain why events charged with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this setting of patients and support the role of cognitive behavior stress management strategies </plain></SENT>
