<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially identified as integral components of the cytoskeleton in erythrocytes, a recent explosion in ankyrin research has demonstrated that these proteins play prominent roles in cytoskeletal signaling pathways and membrane protein trafficking/regulation in a variety of excitable and non-excitable cells including heart and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, ankyrin research has translated from bench to bedside with the discovery of human gene variants associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> that alter ankyrin-based pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> have also been found to play an instrumental role in various forms of sinus node disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mouse models of ankyrin-deficiency have played fundamental roles in the translation of ankyrin-based research to new clinical understanding of human sinus node disease, AF, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
