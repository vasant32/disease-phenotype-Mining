<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite the performing of an optimal surgical repair, TOF patients are at times characterized by a poor long-term survival rate, likely due to cardiac causes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 80s it was irrefutably demonstrated that QRS prolongation ≥180 msec at basal electrocardiogram is a strong predictor for refining risk stratification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to undertake a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies conducted to assess the impact of QRS duration on the development of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in repaired TOF subjects </plain></SENT>
