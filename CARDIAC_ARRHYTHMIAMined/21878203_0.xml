<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Strong electrical shocks can cause focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the mechanism of which is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strong shocks have been shown to produce diastolic Ca(i)(2+) increase, which may initiate focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> via spontaneous Ca(i)(2+) rise (SCR), activation of inward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchange current (I(NCX)), and rise in membrane potential (V(m)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be hypothesized that this mechanism is responsible for generation of shock-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the roles of SCRs and I(NCX) in shock-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The occurrence of SCRs during shock-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was assessed in neonatal rat myocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Simultaneous V(m)-Ca(i)(2+) optical mapping at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> source demonstrated that V(m) upstrokes always preceded Ca(i)(2+) transients, and V(m)-Ca(i)(2+) delays were not different between arrhythmic and paced beats (5.5 ± 0.9 and 5.7 ± 0.4 ms, respectively, P = .5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shocks caused gradual rise of diastolic Ca(i)(2+) consistent with membrane electroporation but no significant Ca(i)(2+) rises immediately before V(m) upstrokes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of the Ca(i)(2+) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> BAPTA-AM (10 μmol/L) decreased the duration of shock-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> whereas application of the I(NCX) inhibitor KB-R7943 (2 μmol/L) increased it, indicating that, despite the absence of SCRs, changes in Ca(i)(2+) affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that this effect is mediated by Ca(i)(2+) inhibition of outward I(K1) current and destabilization of resting V(m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible role of I(K1) was supported by application of the I(K1) inhibitor BaCl(2) (0.2 mmol/L), which increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shock-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in neonatal rat myocyte monolayers are not caused by SCRs and inward I(NCX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> depend on Ca(i)(2+) changes, possibly via Ca(i)(2+)-dependent modulation of outward I(K1) current </plain></SENT>
