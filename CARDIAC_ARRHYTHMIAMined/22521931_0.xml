<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is substantial, exceeding 25% in multiple recent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although AF patients undergoing CRT show improved echocardiographic parameters, functional status, and quality of life in, they benefit to a lesser degree than do patients in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also exhibit a trend toward increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Understanding the barriers to response from CRT among AF patients is critical to addressing the needs of growing populations of patients with AF and HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Foremost among these are suboptimal biventricular pacing, often characterized by fusion or pseudo-fusion complexes, leading to inefficient CRT delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AF increases the risk of inappropriate shocks, which lead to substantial psychiatric morbidity, increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization, and may also increase mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assiduous rate control is reasonable for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AF patients receiving CRT, but there is a paucity of data regarding specific antiarrhythmic drug therapy recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with permanent AF and severe symptoms, atrioventricular junction ablation appears effective in improving response by ensuring biventricular capture and reducing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock burden in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catheter-based techniques such as pulmonary vein isolation appear more attractive and in the future may offer further advantages and lower risks, particularly for patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
