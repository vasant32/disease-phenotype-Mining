<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones have been suspected to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> but data are lacking, particularly for the individual fluoroquinolones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the risk of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> or sudden/unattended <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> identified in hospital discharge diagnoses, related to fluoroquinolones as a class as well as for each individual molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a cohort of patients treated for respiratory conditions from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2005, identified using the healthcare databases from the province of Quebec (Canada), with follow-up until 31 March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control analysis was performed within this cohort, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurring during follow-up identified from hospitalization records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases were matched with up to 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression was used to compute adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with fluoroquinolone use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the cohort of 605127 subjects, 1838 cases were identified (incidence rate=4.7/10000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was elevated with current fluoroquinolone use (RR=1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.59), in particular with new current use (RR=2.23; 95% CI, 1.31-3.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5280,53560,53562">Gatifloxacin</z:chebi> use was associated with the highest rate (RR=7.38; 95% CI, 2.30-23.70); moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also associated with elevated rates of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RR=3.30; 95% CI, 1.47-7.37 and RR=2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.46, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use fluoroquinolones is associated with an elevated risk of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, with some differences among molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given that the individual fluoroquinolones share various indications, the relative risks of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> could inform the choice of different molecules in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
