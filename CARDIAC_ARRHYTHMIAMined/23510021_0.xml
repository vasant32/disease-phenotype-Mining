<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lead extraction (LE) techniques have evolved from simple traction to extraction with dilators and powered sheaths with very high success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the systematic implementation of a stepwise approach, we aimed to identify those characteristics that can predict the need for advanced LE techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2005 and March 2012, 208 consecutive LE procedures were performed and 456 leads were extracted using an initial superior approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advanced techniques for LE (step 4 according to our stepwise approach) were used in 122 patients (58.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Younger patient age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.963, P = 0.002), longer duration of the initial implantation (OR = 1.013, P = 0.002), the number of extracted leads (OR = 2.184, P &lt; 0.001), and the presence of right ventricular defibrillator leads (OR = 2.144, P = 0.049) independently predicted the necessity of using step 4 in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A prediction tool was created taking into account four categorical variables derived even from Receiver Operating Curve analysis of quantitative characteristics (age &lt; 70.7 years, implant duration &gt; 37 months, extraction of at least two leads, one of them being a defibrillator lead) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the four characteristics was accompanied by 0% positive predictive value for the requirement of step 4 for LE, whereas the coexistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four risk factors is characterized by 87% requirement of advanced LE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In most of the patients with indication for LE, use of a powered sheath extraction is necessary in order to obtain clinical success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have identified four patient and lead characteristics that may help the operator plan the means of extraction </plain></SENT>
