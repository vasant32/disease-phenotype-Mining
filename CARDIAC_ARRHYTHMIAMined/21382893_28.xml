<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the LV lead position on outcome in patients randomized to cardiac resynchronization-defibrillation in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The location of the LV lead was assessed by means of coronary venograms and chest x-rays recorded at the time of device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LV lead location was classified along the short axis into an anterior, lateral, or posterior position and along the long axis into a basal, midventricular, or apical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of MADIT-CRT was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) hospitalization or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, whichever came first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LV lead position was assessed in 799 patients, (55% patients ≥65 years of age, 26% female, 10% LV ejection fraction ≤25%, 55% ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and 71% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo>) with a follow-up of 29±11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of cardiac resynchronization therapy benefit was similar for leads in the anterior, lateral, or posterior position (P=0.652) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The apical lead location compared with leads located in the nonapical position (basal or midventricular region) was associated with a significantly increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio=1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.71; P=0.019) after adjustment for the clinical covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The apical lead position was also associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio=2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 5.97; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LV leads positioned in the apical region were associated with an unfavorable outcome, suggesting that this lead location should be avoided in cardiac resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
