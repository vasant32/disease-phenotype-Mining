<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its perspective has been changing in the era of ablation of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at evaluating accessory pathways ablation efficacy within the last nine years at one center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From February 2002 to June 2011, catheter ablation of accessory pathways was performed in 247 patients (100 females, 42 Â± 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elimination of accessory pathways conduction in both directions was the procedure endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediate accessory pathways conduction elimination at the first ablation was achieved in 228 (92%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation failed to eliminate accessory pathways conduction in 19 (8%) patients, or accessory pathways conduction subsequently recurred in another 7 (3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat ablation was completed in 20 (8%) patients, 2 patients underwent a third ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, accessory pathway was permanently eliminated in 238 (96%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation failure was connected with a risky position in the vicinity of atrio-ventricular conduction system in 6 (67 %) out of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By the individual A, B, C, D operators experience, efficacy of the first procedure/total efficacy, was 97%/99%, 90%/96%, 87%/87%, and 91%/91%, respectively (comparison of inter-operator efficacy of the first and repeat ablation by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test: p = 0,19 and 0,05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Accessory pathways ablation efficacy exceeds 95%, and ablation failure is dominantly related to the accessory pathways location close to the atrio-ventricular conduction system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individual operator's experience was associated with a certain disparity between high and nearly absolute accessory pathways ablation efficacy </plain></SENT>
