<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> and arrythmogenesis have been attributed to proteins shed by the parasite, although this has not been fully demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of substances shed by T. cruzi on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a triple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) protocol whereby the isolated beating rat hearts were perfused with either Vero-control or Vero T. cruzi-infected conditioned medium during the different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and subsequently reperfused with Tyrode's solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG and heart rate were recorded during the entire experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that triple I/R-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was associated with the generation of auricular-ventricular blockade during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and non-sustained nodal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, perfusion with Vero-infected medium produced a delay in the reperfusion-induced recovery of heart rate, increased the frequency of tachycardic events and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the presence of parasite-shed substances in conditioned media enhances the arrhythmogenic effects that occur during the I/R protocol </plain></SENT>
