<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The number of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices has increased progressively and has led to an increased need for transvenous lead extraction (TLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple reports of TLE procedural outcomes exist; however, data regarding postprocedural and long-term mortality are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing TLE at a single, high-volume center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, indications, and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multivariable Cox regression model was developed to identify factors associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between January 2000 and December 2010, 985 patients underwent 1043 TLE procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cohort was 68% male, with a mean age of 63 years (range, 15-95 years) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40Â±17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indications included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> (18%), pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (32%), lead malfunction (30%), and other (device upgrade, venous occlusion, and advisory leads; 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range, 0.1-11.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a cumulative mortality of 2.1% at 30 days, 4.2% at 3 months, 8.4% at 1 year, and 46.8% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> (hazard ratio [HR], 3.52; 95% CI, 1.95-6.38; P&lt;0.0001), local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (HR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.55-4.67; P=0.0004), device system upgrade (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.07-4.25; P=0.03; indication compared with a reference group of extraction for lead malfunction), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.25-2.35; P=0.0009), increasing age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07; P&lt;0.0001), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35; P=0.04) were significant correlates of increased mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although TLE procedural mortality is exceedingly low at high-volume centers, postprocedural and long-term mortality remain high in certain patient populations, such as elderly patients and those undergoing TLE for infectious indications and device system upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Information regarding TLE long-term outcomes may help guide cardiovascular implantable electronic device and lead management </plain></SENT>
