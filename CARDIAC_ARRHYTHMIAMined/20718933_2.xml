<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dahme (2001) developed a within-individual correction procedure by which the effects of respiration on RSA may be estimated using regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We replicated their procedure substituting a spectral high-frequency measure of RSA for a time-domain statistic and a respiratory belt's relative measure of tidal volume for the direct assessment provided by a pneumotachograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized slopes from the respiratory belt and pneumotachography-derived regression equations (estimated across a 6-min paced breathing protocol) were positively correlated (r=0.93, p&lt;.001); correlations were similar across 2- and 4-min time courses parsed from the 6-min protocol </plain></SENT>
