<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chest CT scans visualize organs other than the heart and collateral findings may be identified incidentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical relevance of such collateral findings in patients undergoing AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-three patients (127 males, age 59 Â± 10 years) underwent chest CT scan for image integration in AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collateral findings from visualized thoracic and upper abdominal organs were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings that required further investigations or treatment according to current guidelines were considered as clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 164 collateral findings were identified in 97 (56%) patients, and most patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002088'>abnormalities of the lungs</z:hpo> (67 patients, 39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (28%) patients had clinically significant findings needing further investigation and 17 (10%) of them required specific treatments, including three cases (1.7 %) of lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT images acquired for integration in AF ablation should be read thoroughly as they may serve as a screening tool for otherwise unrecognized clinically significant conditions of the heart, lungs, or other visualized organs </plain></SENT>
