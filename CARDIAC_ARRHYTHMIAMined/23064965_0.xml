<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes including SCN5A encoding the Î±-subunit of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (hNav1.5) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> via altered function of cardiac ion channels, but more than two-thirds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> remains pathogenetically elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum are essential in excitation of cardiomyocytes, and sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP) is a protein of unknown function localizing at T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 190 unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> patients for mutations in SLMAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two missense mutations, Val269Ile and Glu710Ala, were found in heterozygous state in 2 patients but were not found in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Membrane surface expression of hNav1.5 in the transfected cells was affected by the mutations, and silencing of mutant SLMAP by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> rescued the surface expression of hNav1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of hNav1.5-expressing cells transfected with mutant SLMAP confirmed the reduced hNav1.5 current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mutations in SLMAP may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> via modulating the intracellular trafficking of hNav1.5 channel </plain></SENT>
