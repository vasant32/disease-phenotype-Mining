<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chip thermoluminescent dosemeters were placed at the eyes, chest, wrists and legs of the operator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ranges of fluoroscopy time and air kerma area product values associated with cardiac ablation procedures were wide (6.3-48.3 min and 1.7-80.3 Gy cm(2), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measured median radiation doses per procedure for each monitored position were 23.6 and 21.3 μSv to the left and right wrists, respectively, 25.3 and 30.4 μSv to the left and right legs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The doses to the eyes were below the minimum detectable dose of 9 μSv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated median effective dose was 22.5 μSv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering the actual workload of the operator, the calculated annual doses to the hands, legs and eyes, as well as the annual effective dose, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> below the corresponding limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study indicate that cardiac ablation procedures performed at a modern laboratory do not impose a high radiation hazard to the operator when radiation protection measures are routinely adopted </plain></SENT>
