<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF) can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Digoxin is often used as first-line therapy but can be ineffective and is poorly transferred to the fetus in the presence of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As an alternative to digoxin monotherapy, we have been using sotalol at presentation in fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> or AF with, or at risk of, developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> to attempt to achieve more rapid control of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was a retrospective review of the clinical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pregnancies with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> diagnosed and managed at a single center from 2004 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 29 affected pregnancies, 21 (16 SVT and 5 AF) were treated with sotalol at presentation, with or without concurrent administration of digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 21, 11 (6 SVT and 5 AF) had resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> within 5 days (median 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six others showed some response (less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, rate slowing, resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo>) without complete conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 fetus with a slow response, the mother chose pregnancy termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5 survivors with a slow response were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> difficult to treat postnatally, including 1 requiring radiofrequency ablation as a neonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One fetus developed blocked atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> after 1 dose of sotalol and was prematurely delivered for fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three grossly hydropic fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> showed no response and died within 1 to 3 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transplacental sotalol, alone or combined with digoxin, is effective for the treatment of fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and AF, with an 85% complete or partial response rate in our series </plain></SENT>
