<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> of pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) origin, those arising from the superior vena cava (SVC) can precipitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the electrophysiological properties of canine SVC sleeve preparations and the effect of ranolazine on late phase 3 early and delayed afterdepolarization (EAD and DAD)-induced triggered activity in SVC sleeves and compares SVC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeve electrophysiological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potentials (APs) were recorded from superfused SVC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeves using microelectrode techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (1 μmol/L), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (1 μmol/L), high calcium ([Ca(2+)](o)=5.4 mmol/L), or a combination were used to induce EADs, DADs, and triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A marked diversity of action potential characteristics was observed in the SVC sleeve, including action potentials with short and long APs, with and without phase 4 depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rapid pacing induced hyperpolarization, accentuating the slope of phase 4 depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phase 4 depolarization and rapid pacing-induced hyperpolarization were reduced or eliminated after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (10 μmol/L) or ranolazine (10 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APs displaying phase 4 depolarization (n=19) had longer APDs, smaller amplitude and V(max), and a more positive take-off potential than APs lacking phase 4 depolarization (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine (5-10 μmol/L) eliminated late phase 3 EAD- and DAD-induced triggered activity as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced automaticity elicited in SVC sleeves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, SVC sleeves display phase 4 depolarization, smaller V(max), and longer APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic influences promote spontaneous automaticity and triggered activity in SVC sleeves, thus generating extrasystolic activity capable of initiating atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine can effectively suppress these triggers </plain></SENT>
