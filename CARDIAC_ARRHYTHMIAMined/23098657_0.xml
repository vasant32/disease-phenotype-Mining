<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized open-chest animals (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg, i.p.) were subjected to 20-min left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 3-h reperfusion for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were monitored during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at the beginning (3 min) of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi> were measured to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> redox state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term fasting limited the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (48.5+/-3.3 % of the area at risk) compared to controls (74.3+/-2.2 %) and reduced the total number of premature ventricular complexes (12.5+/-5.8) compared to controls (194.9+/-21.9) as well as the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (0.6+/-0.4 s vs. 18.8+/-2.5 s) occurring at early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, fasting increased the concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate and beta-hydroxybutyrate/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="13705">acetoacetate</z:chebi> ratio (87.8+/-27.0) compared to controls (7.9+/-1.7), reflecting altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> redox state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that three-day fasting effectively protected rat hearts against major endpoints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to find out whether these beneficial effects can be linked to altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> redox state resulting from increased ketogenesis </plain></SENT>
