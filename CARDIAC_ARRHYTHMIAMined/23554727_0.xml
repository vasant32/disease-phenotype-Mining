<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the effect of garlic (Allium sativum Linn.) aqueous extracts on ischemic preconditioning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion induced cardiac injury, as well as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> involvement in ischemic preconditioning and garlic extract induced cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury was established using Langendorff apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aqueous extract of garlic dose was standardized (0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.07%, 0.05%, 0.03%, 0.01%), and the 0.05% dose was found to be the most effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher doses (more than 0.05%) were highly toxic, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and cardiodepression, whereas the lower doses were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Garlic exaggerated the cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning and garlic cardioprotection was significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> (1,000 Âµmol/L) and 8-SPT (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and expressed by increased myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, <z:mp ids='MP_0002944'>increased LDH level</z:mp>, and reduced <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> is involved in the pharmacological and molecular mechanism of garlic induced cardioprotection and mediated by the modulation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
