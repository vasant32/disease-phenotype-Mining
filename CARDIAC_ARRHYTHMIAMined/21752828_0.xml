<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate whether biomarkers of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolism can predict the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and might be used as risk markers in these pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma levels of l-arginine (Arg), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA), monomethyl l-arginine, and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate were examined in 106 consecutive pts (mean age 65 years, 97 male, mean LV-EF 24 ± 6%), with ischaemic (n= 82) or non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n= 24) who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation for primary prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention was assessed during a mean follow-up of 344 days, and occurred in 18 of 106 (17%) pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethylarginine plasma levels were significantly higher in pts with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention compared with those without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention (0.564 ± 0.083 μmol/L vs. 0.513 ± 0.088 μmol; P= 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Arg/ADMA ratio was found lower in pts with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention than in those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention (144.71 ± 32.50 vs. 175.29 ± 41.29; P= 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate Cox regression showed that ADMA (P = 0.028) and the Arg/ADMA ratio (P = 0.003) were associated with a higher incidence of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, an ADMA concentration above the 50th centile was independently associated with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention, revealing a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.21 (CI 95 %: 1.14-15.63; P = 0.028, Table 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An Arg/ADMA ratio below the 25th centile had a HR of 3.83 (1.360-10.87; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Asymmetric dimethylarginine and the Arg/ADMA ratio seem to be new biomarkers for the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes and of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention in pts with left ventricular ejection fraction dysfunction (LV-EF ≤ 35%), suggesting a value for risk stratification in these pts </plain></SENT>
