<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 4-month-old female who had previously undergone successful ablation of a left-sided accessory pathway was taken to the electrophysiology lab due to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While in this second <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, we found earliest atrial activation in the distal right atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography confirmed a connection between right atrial appendage and the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation at this location promptly terminated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following ablation, there were no further inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and ventriculo-atrial dissociation was appreciated </plain></SENT>
