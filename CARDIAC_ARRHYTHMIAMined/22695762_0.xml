<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previously, we showed that the ganglionated plexi (GP) on the atrium can play a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the role of the atrial neural network as a substrate for AF without the influence of the GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized open-chest dogs, two barriers across the left/right atrial appendage (AA) divided the AA into smaller and larger areas of approximately similar size, 2 cm² </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation of the superior left and right GP allowed measurement of the greatest percent slowing of the heart rate prior to atrial excitation (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>; 1, 10, and 100 mM) was applied to the smaller and then to the larger area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 22 dogs, the effects on AF duration in response to <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> applied to the atria were tested after GP ablations and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> applied to the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GP function was unchanged by various concentrations of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> applied to the smaller or larger areas of the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, AF duration was significantly longer for each <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> concentration when applied to the larger versus the smaller area (p ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AF was attenuated by GP ablations and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, but the differences between small and large areas were maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> on a larger area of the atria significantly increased the induced AF duration compared to an area half the size without changes in GP function suggesting that recruiting a larger area of the atrial neural network provided more of an AF substrate </plain></SENT>
