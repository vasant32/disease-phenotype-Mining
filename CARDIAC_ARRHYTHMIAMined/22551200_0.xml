<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent years, catheter ablation has increasingly been used for ablation of idiopathic premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (IVTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mapping and catheter ablation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the vicinity of tricuspid annulus (TA) may not be fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate electrophysiologic characteristics and effects of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for patients with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrophysiologic recordings were analyzed in 35 patients with symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/ IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RFCA was performed using pace mapping and activation mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 35 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs arising from the vicinity of TA, complete elimination of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs could be achieved by RFCA in 32 patients (success rate 91.43%) during a median follow-up period of 21â€‰months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA had distinctive ECG characteristics that were useful for identifying the precise origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An rS pattern was recorded in lead V1 in 93.1% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs from the free wall of TA, vs 16.7% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs from the septal TA, whereas a QS pattern in lead V1 occurred in 83.3% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs from the septal TA vs 6.9% of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> from the free wall of the TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The precordial R wave transition occurred by lead V3 or earlier in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs originating from the septal portion of the TA, as compared to transition beyond V3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs from the free wall of the TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RFCA is an effective curative therapy for symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/IVTs originating from the vicinity of TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are specific characteristics in ECG and the ablation site could be located by ECG analysis </plain></SENT>
