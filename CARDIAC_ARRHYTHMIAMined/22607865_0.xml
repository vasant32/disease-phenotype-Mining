<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the value of indices of myocardial deformation on speckle-tracking echocardiography for quantifying ventricular function and their potential role in assessing ventricular-ventricular interaction and outcome in patients with a systemic RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (87 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and atrial switch and 42 with ccTGA, 71 men, age 35 ± 12 years) were investigated, and biventricular myocardial deformation was compared with findings in healthy subjects (n = 38, age 36 ± 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic ventricular longitudinal 2-dimensional (2D) peak systolic strain (RV 2D-LS) was significantly reduced compared with controls (-12.9 ± 3.6 and -15.4 ± 5.1 vs -21.0 ± 5.5 in <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGAs</z:mp>, ccTGAs, and controls, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic and pulmonary 2D-LS were correlated in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> (r = 0.46, P &lt; .0001) and ccTGA (r = 0.64, P &lt; .0001), suggesting interventricular interaction, and this was confirmed when ejection fraction on magnetic resonance imaging was assessed (r = 0.53, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More importantly, systemic 2D-LS (hazard ratio 1.31, P = .01) was related to adverse clinical outcome (symptomatic progression to New York Heart Association class ≥3, clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and atrial switch independently of ejection fraction on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, history of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or functional class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Global longitudinal systolic strain is significantly reduced in patients with a systemic RV, is related to subpulmonary ventricular function, and predicts adverse clinical outcome in adults with atrial switch <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
