<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dog was recumbent, dyspnoeic and mildly tachypnoeic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a tachyarrhythmia (300 beats per minute) and subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of the ventral neck and right forelimb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog had a sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> originating in the right ventricle and on echocardiography a mass was identified in the interventricular septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to the poor prognosis the owners agreed to euthanasia of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: A reddish-grey mass was found in the interventricular septum and smaller red foci found scattered throughout the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a single, raised, splenic nodule with several smaller red foci within the splenic parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> of the right forelimb and neck were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sections of the splenic nodule, interventricular septal mass and both ventricular-free walls showed neoplastic mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018923" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Haemangiosarcoma</z:e> of the myocardium and spleen with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This case report describes an atypical location for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018923" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiosarcoma</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The investigation supports the use of echocardiography as a component of the protocol for staging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018923" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiosarcoma</z:e> even in the absence of apericardial effusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It also provides further evidence for the inclusion of intracardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> as a differential diagnosis for dogs with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
