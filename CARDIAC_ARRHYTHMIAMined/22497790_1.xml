<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Randomized unblinded controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: A tertiary multidisciplinary intensive care unit enrolling 100 critically ill patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Placement of longer (20-24 cm) versus shorter dialysis catheters (15-20 cm) within one of the major thoracic veins for initiation of CRRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The primary study outcome was duration of dialysis circuit life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included delivered daily dialysis dose, incidence and cause of CRRT circuit failure, complications potentially related to the position of the short-term dialysis catheter, mortality, and patient length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Placing the longer dialysis catheters was associated with an increased average dialyzer life span of 6.5 hours (24 hours [25th-75th percentile, 11-32] vs 17.5 hours [25th-75th percentile, 8-23]; P = 0.001), improved delivered daily dialysis dose (91% [25th-75th percentile, 85%-100%] vs 81% [25th-75th percentile, 72%-97%]; P &lt; 0.001), and reduced number of dialyzers clotted (2.3 vs 3.6; P = 0.04) or circuits taken down due to vascular access problem (0.19 vs 0.53; P = 0.04) per patient compared with placing shorter dialysis catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was similar between groups (28% vs 21%; P = 0.6) and the only mechanical complication was the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> of one dialysis catheter tip in the longer dialysis catheter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Single-center study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of longer soft <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> short-term dialysis catheters targeting right atrial placement appeared to be safe and could improve dialyzer life span and daily dialysis dose of CRRT delivered compared with the use of shorter catheters targeting superior vena cava placement </plain></SENT>
