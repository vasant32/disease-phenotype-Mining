<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of AF in hospitalized old patients as well as its characteristics and related clinical and therapeutic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study in patients aged â‰¥ 70 years with AF, who had been hospitalized in Internal Medicine or Geriatrics wards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> variables studied were obtained from the patients' clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 3,319 evaluable patients, 922 had an AF, which represents a prevalence of 31.3% (CI 95%; 29.7-32.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 82 years (6.1; 69.9-101.8) and 57% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>88.7% of patients (818 p) had an AF before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF was long-standing persistent or permanent in 728 cases (89.1%) and it was the first episode (paroxysmal or persistent) in 51 patients (6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a clear etiology of AF in only 4.1% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was the commonest reason for hospitalization in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, 80.3% patients were hypertensive, 36.4% had dyslipemia, 38.2% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 5% were active smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Associated diseases included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> (38.1%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (38.2%); in addition, 188 patients (20.4%) had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, 67.4% patients had received antiarrhythmic drugs for their FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although 86.1% had received thromboembolic prevention therapy, only 54.1% were under oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, 6.9% patients had antiarrhythmic drugs-related side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of hospitalized patients older than 70 years have AF, which is generally relapsing and permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> is the commonest reason for hospitalization in these patients and about 40% have an associated disease </plain></SENT>
