<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity signal-the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor (HEM-790IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5 mmHg and grade A as per the British <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Society protocol for estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor </plain></SENT>
