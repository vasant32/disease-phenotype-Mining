<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a residual jump associated or not with an isolated echo is correlated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Inclusion criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> successful slow pathway cryoablation for slow-fast AVNRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria: use of a 4 mm tip cryocatheter, no baseline elicitable jump or inducible AVNRT, and unwanted persistent first degree atrioventricular (AV) block at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation (-80°C × 4 min) was applied after successful cryomapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> inducibility was checked 30 min later on and off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was defined as AVNRT non-inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 332 patients (pts) who had undergone cryoablation from May 2002 to March 2010 in our institutions, 245 of them fulfilled the entry criteria (173 women, mean age 41 ± 16 years, ineffective drugs 1.3 ± 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 7-Fr 6-mm tip cryocatheter (CryoCath®) was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline AV nodal effective refractory period (ERP) was 271 ± 55 ms, post-procedural ERP 331 ± 60 ms (P&lt; 0.001), and the mean of the difference between baseline and post-procedural ERP 63 ± 38 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A/V ratio at successful site was 1 ± 0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-four pts (18%) had a residual jump at the end of the procedure, and 14 of them had an associated single echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Global cryoapplication time was 993 ± 797 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 40 ± 10 months, 43 pts (17.5%) had recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 12 months follow-up, actuarial rate of recurrence-free pts was 85% in the group without residual jump (201 pts), 63.3% with residual jump and no echo (30 pts), and 60.6% with residual jump associated with a single echo (P&lt; 0.003 among groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of recurrences were persistence of a residual jump (P&lt; 0.001) and total cryoapplication time (P&lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, only residual jump was independently correlated with recurrences (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing AVNRT cryoablation, slow-pathway suppression is correlated with a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A single echo is associated with a recurrence risk similar to residual jump without echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It may be suggested that pursuing a procedural endpoint up to slow pathway complete suppression may improve long-term success </plain></SENT>
