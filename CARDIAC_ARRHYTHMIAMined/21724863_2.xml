<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that salt-induced elevated blood pressure (BP) leads to atrial K(ATP) channel activation and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated BP was induced in mice with a high-salt diet (HS) for 4 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution optical mapping was used to measure atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility, effective refractory period (ERP), and action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excised patch clamping was performed to quantify K(ATP) channel properties and density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channel protein expression was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility was 22% higher in HS hearts compared with control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ERP and APD(90) were significantly shorter in the right atrial appendage and left atrial appendage of HS hearts compared with control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perfusion with 1 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or 300 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi> significantly decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility and prolonged APD(90) in HS hearts compared with untreated HS hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) channel density was 156% higher in myocytes isolated from HS animals compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">Sulfonylurea</z:chebi> receptor 1 protein expression was increased in the left atrial appendage and right atrial appendage of HS animals (415% and 372% of NS animals, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, K(ATP) channel activation provides a mechanistic link between salt-induced elevated BP and increased atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility </plain></SENT>
