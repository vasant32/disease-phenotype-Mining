<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite important improvements in current device technology and implantation techniques, specific complications still remain and warrant consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular complications and peri-procedural neurological events were the first concerns to emerge with this new technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, significant post procedural para-valvular leak has been shown to be more frequent after TAVI than after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and its potential association with worse long-term prognostic has raised concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In moving toward treatment of lower risk populations, structural integrity and long-term durability of heat valve prosthesis are becoming of central importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emerging technologies and newer generations of devices seem promising in dealing with these matters </plain></SENT>
