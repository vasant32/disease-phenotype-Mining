<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesized that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> demonstrate extreme, transient changes in arterial pressures as well as new arrhythmic activity during cocaine use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressures, heart rates, and electrocardiograms (AECGs) were recorded for 48 hours in 10 patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who smoke cocaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active cocaine use was identified through patient diaries and manual activation of the blood pressure cuff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 patients studied (6 men, 7 African Americans, age 49±8 years), 8 were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean blood pressure prior to cocaine use was 126/77 mm Hg and average increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure after use was 74 mm Hg, 30 mm Hg, and 45 mm Hg, respectively (P&lt;.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AECGs demonstrated arrhythmic activity during cocaine use, including 6 patients with increased atrial and ventricular ectopy, 2 patients with episodes of nonsustained atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and 1 patient with 3 episodes of nonsustained monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use resulted in extreme elevations in arterial pressures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> taking medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cocaine use was also associated with an increase in arrhythmic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may underlie the heightened risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, and potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who use cocaine </plain></SENT>
