<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study proposes new parameters describing depolarization and repolarization inhomogeneity in high resolution body surface potential maps (HR BSPM) to identify MI patients threatened by VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: High resolution ECGs were recorded from 64 surface leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time-averaged HR BSPMs were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several parameters for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk assessment were calculated in 2 groups of MI patients: those with and without documented VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a control group of healthy subjects was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk of VT, the following parameters were proposed: correlation coefficient between STT and QRST integral maps (STT_QRST_CORR), departure index of absolute value of STT integral map (STT_DI), and departure index of absolute value of T-wave shape index (TSI_DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These new parameters were compared to known parameters: QRS width, QT interval, QT dispersion, Tpeak-Tend interval, total cosines between QRS complex and T wave, and non-dipolar content of QRST integral maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: STT_DI, TSI_DI, STT_QRST_CORR, QRS width, and QT interval parameters were statistically significant (p â‰¤ 0.05) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivity was found for the STT_DI parameter (0.77) and the highest specificity for TSI_DI (0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk is demonstrated by both abnormal spatial distribution of the repolarization phase and changed relationship between depolarization and repolarization phases, as well as their prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proposed new parameters might be applied for risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
