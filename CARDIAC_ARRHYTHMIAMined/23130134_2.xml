<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFAs) might have antiarrhythmic properties, but data conflict on whether n3-PUFAs reduce rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that n3-PUFAs would reduce post-CABG AF, and we tested this hypothesis in a well-powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing CABG were randomized to pharmaceutical-grade n3-PUFAs 2 g orally twice daily (minimum of 6 g) or a matched placebo â‰¥24 hours before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gas chromatography was used to assess plasma fatty acid composition of samples collected on the day of screening, day of surgery, and postoperative day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment continued either until the primary end point, clinically significant AF requiring treatment, occurred or for a maximum of 2 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty patients were enrolled and randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, n3-PUFA dosing increased plasma n3-PUFA levels from 2.9% to 4% and reduced the n6:n3-PUFA ratio from 9.1 to 6.4 (both P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar changes were noted on postoperative day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> changes in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of post-CABG AF was similar in both groups (30% n3-PUFAs versus 33% placebo, P=0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post-CABG AF odds ratio for n3-PUFAs relative to placebo was 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.52-1.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in any secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral n3-PUFA supplementation begun 2 days before CABG did not reduce AF or other complications after surgery </plain></SENT>
