<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, high driving power of a VAD may cause severe ventricle suction that can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, and pump damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, an appropriate VAD driving level that maximizes the assist effect without severe systolic suction was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The target driving level was set at the boundary between low driving power without suction and high driving power with frequent suction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the boundary range, intermittent mild suction may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Driving power was regulated by the suction occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-suction boundary control method was evaluated in a female goat implanted with an undulation pump ventricular assist device (UPVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The UPVAD was driven in a semipulsatile mode with heartbeat synchronization control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic driving power was adjusted using a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-suction boundary control method developed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that driving power could be maintained in the boundary range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occurrences of suction were evaluated using the suction ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We defined this ratio as the number of suction occurrences divided by the number of heartbeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The suction ratio decreased by 70% when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-suction boundary control method was used </plain></SENT>
