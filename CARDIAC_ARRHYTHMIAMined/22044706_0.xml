<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF may be a stable, "isolated" rhythm, a bridge between sinus rhythm and AF, or both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether the characteristics of isolated AFL are different from those of patients with AFL combined with AF is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare the clinical characteristics of patients with isolated AFL to those of patients with AFL combined with AF, in a series of patients referred for AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients (mean age 66.9Â±12.2 years; 53 men) with a history of electrocardiogram-documented paroxysmal or persistent AFL, referred for catheter ablation, underwent clinical work-up including bidimensional echocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided into group I (44 with isolated AFL) and group II (32 with AFL and a history of AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was present in 62 patients (81.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> (n=44, 57.9%) and was more prevalent in group II than in group I (75.0% vs 45.5%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of prior cardiac surgery was higher in group I (22.7% vs 6.3%; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AFL was persistent in 35 group I patients and 17 group II patients (79.5% vs 53.1%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Class I or III antiarrhythmic drug use was more frequent in group II (84.4% vs 45.5%; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed significant differences between patients with isolated AFL and those with AFL combined with AF, in the prevalence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and the use of antiarrhythmic medication, which were higher when both atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In turn, the history of cardiac surgery (including atriotomy), was more common in patients with isolated AFL than in those with AFL combined with AF </plain></SENT>
