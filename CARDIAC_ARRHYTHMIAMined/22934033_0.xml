<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many species, these layers are not juxtaposed by invaginations of the plasma membrane (transverse tubules; 'T-tubules'), so that calcium-induced-calcium signals rely on centripetal propagation rather than voltage-synchronized channel openings to invade the interior of the cell and trigger contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of this specific cellular geometry and dynamics of calcium release can lead to novel autonomous spatio-temporal calcium waves, and in particular ping waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are waves of calcium release activity that spread as counter-rotating sectors of elevated calcium within a single layer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors, and can seed further longitudinal calcium waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show, using a computational model, that these calcium waves can dominate the response of a cell to electrical pacing and hence are pro-arrhythmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This highlights the importance of modeling internal cellular structures when investigating mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction such as atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
