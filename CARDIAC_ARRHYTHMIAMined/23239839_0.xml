<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Data regarding long-term outcomes after the arterial switch operation for D-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-institution retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess cardiovascular outcomes after an arterial switch operation between 1983 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients without follow-up visits within 3 years were contacted and secondary sources of information obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 400 patients, 154 (38.3%) with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, 238 (59.5%) with an intact septum, and 9 (2.3%) with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="DORV">Taussig-Bing anomaly</z:e>, were followed for a median of 18.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In perioperative survivors, overall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 25 years were 96.7±1.8% and 96.6±0.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was predominantly a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 25 years, 75.5±2.5% remained free from surgical or catheter-based reintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from an adverse cardiovascular event was 92.9±1.9% at 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors were a single right coronary artery (hazard ratio, 4.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-15.90), P=0.0166) and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 6.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-30.62; P=0.0107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 60.3±8.9%, 97.3% had class I symptoms, and 5.2% obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peak oxygen uptake was 35.1±7.6 mL/kg/min (86.1±15.1% predicted), with a chronotropic index &lt;80% in 34.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At least moderate neoaortic and <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> were present in 3.4% and 6.6%, respectively, and more than mild neoaortic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> in 3.2% and 10.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival is excellent after arterial switch operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although sequelae include chronotropic incompetence and neoaortic, pulmonary, and coronary artery complications, most patients maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function and exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
