<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo> (EA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are frequently encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be targeted with catheter ablation, specific issues render the procedure more challenging in EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines the mechanisms of the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> related to EA and the outcome after catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical and procedural data of catheter ablation in patients with EA in 4 European centers were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 32 patients (mean age 24 Â± 15 years), 34 accessory pathways (APs), 8 intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011699'>atrial reentry tachycardias</z:hpo> (IART), 5 cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (CTI-AFL), 2 focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, and 1 atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients (34%), multiple ablation targets were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (56%) required multiple procedures either for repeat ablation of the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n = 12), ablation of a different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n = 4), or both re-ablation of the same and of a different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedural success rate after first ablation was 80% for APs and CTI-AFL ablation, and 100% for IART ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Redo procedures were necessary in 40% of the patients after ablation of an APs, and in 60% after CTI-AFL ablation, but in none of the patient with IART ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> related to EA are amenable to catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, ablation procedures are challenging and the need for repeat procedure is particularly high, because some patients have multiple ablation targets and because of technical issues in relation with the dysplastic tricuspid annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, several patients develop other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms following ablation </plain></SENT>
