<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In fact, vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) exerted an anti-arrhythmic effect by preserving connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein in ventricles, in a rat model of MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of VNS on ventricular tachyarrhythmia during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI and the expression of Cx43 in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both adult (3-4 months) and aged (â‰¥ 24 months) male rats were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VNS was applied before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> either alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg) or carbenoxolone, a gap junction inhibitor (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 30-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) was higher in aged rats compared with adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VNS significantly suppressed VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in adult rats and these effects were eliminated by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> or carbenoxolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, VNS did not suppress VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in the aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not change the expression levels of total Cx43 protein in adult and aged rat ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the expression level of total Cx43 protein was two times lower in sham-operated aged rats than that in sham-operated adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, in aged rats, loss of anti-arrhythmic effect of VNS is associated with reduced expression of Cx43 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Cx43 may be an important target for inhibiting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced VT in adult patients but not in aged patients </plain></SENT>
