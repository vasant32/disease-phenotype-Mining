<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with a modified Fontan connection, particularly the right atrial to right ventricular connection, the pulmonary ventricle may enlarge with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 2006, 10 patients (median age, 24 years) underwent Fontan conversion to a one and one half ventricle repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011662'>Tricuspid atresia</z:hpo> was the most common diagnosis (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right atrial to right ventricular connection was present in 8 patients; 3 patients had a prior bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative median right atrial pressure was 14 mm Hg (range, 12 to 20 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and conduit obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0010422'>right ventricular hypoplasia</z:mp>, with right atrial to right ventricular regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conversion included closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001671'>septal defects</z:hpo>, tricuspid valve replacement (n=8), bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (n=7), valved right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (n=2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one reoperation for residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonged chest tube drainage occurred in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative right atrial pressure ranged from 8 to 14 mm Hg (median, 10 mm Hg; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine patients are in New York Heart Association class I or II, and 1 patient has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857262" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biventricular failure</z:e> and was awaiting transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were two late reoperations, 1 for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the mechanical tricuspid valve prosthesis and 1 for obstruction of the valved right ventricular outflow tract conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three patients had recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> requiring cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fontan conversion to one and one half ventricle repair is feasible in selected patients with a failing Fontan circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Operation can be performed with low early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery should be performed routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Quality of life is excellent </plain></SENT>
