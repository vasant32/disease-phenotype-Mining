<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most often used biomarker for such abnormalities is the prolongation of the QT interval, which relies on the correct annotation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of QRS complex and offset of T-wave on ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new biomarker generated from a functional data-based methodology is developed to quantify the T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> changes from placebo to drug interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of T-wave-form characters through a multivariate linear mixed model are made to assess cardiovascular risk of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data from a study with 60 subjects participating in a two-period placebo-controlled crossover trial with repeat ECGs obtained at baseline and 12 time points after interventions are used to illustrate this methodology; different types of wave form changes were characterized and motivated further investigation </plain></SENT>
