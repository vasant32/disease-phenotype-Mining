<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bipolar electrode spacing on PNS and LV pacing thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrophysiology catheters with standard (2 mm-5 mm-2 mm) or modified (1 mm-5 mm-1 mm) interelectrode spacing was, respectively, inserted in a posterior/lateral cardiac vein in a randomized order in 6 anesthetized dogs via jugular access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phrenic nerve was dissected via a left minithoracotomy and repositioned over the vein as close as possible to one of the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of PNS was verified (ie, PNS threshold &lt;2 V at 0.5 ms in unipolar configuration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bipolar pacing was delivered using the electrode closest to the phrenic nerve as the cathode, and multiple bipolar electrode spacing configurations were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During bipolar pacing, PNS threshold increased as bipolar electrode spacing was reduced (P&lt;0.05), whereas LV pacing thresholds did not change significantly (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with a standard bipolar electrode spacing of 20 mm for LV leads, 1 and 2 mm bipolar electrode spacing resulted in a PNS threshold increase of 5.5±2.2 V (P=0.003) and 2.8±1.7 V (P&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, PNS threshold increased by 6.5±3.7 V with 1 mm and by 3.8±1.9 V with 2 mm bipolar pacing (both P&lt;0.001), compared with unipolar pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that reducing LV bipolar electrode spacing from the standard 20 mm to 1 or 2 mm may significantly increase the PNS threshold without compromising LV pacing thresholds </plain></SENT>
