<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF/AFL) are the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> encountered in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rate versus rhythm control remains a difficult decision, especially in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic indicated for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF/AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the University of Texas MD Anderson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, restoration of sinus rhythm is desirable because many patients have contraindications to anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, most are on multiple medications that prolong the QT interval; therefore, the objective of this study was to establish the safety and efficacy of ibutilide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: This was a retrospective chart review of 81 patients who were identified via the pharmacy database as receiving ibutilide for AF/AFL from January 2002 to May 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes including cardioversion rates and effects on the QT interval were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: Ibutilide use was associated with successful cardioversion in 75% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 81 patients, 68 patients (84%) were on at least 1 medication that prolonged the QT interval at the time of ibutilide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no significant changes in the corrected QT interval pre and post ibutilide cardioversion were noted in any group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Overall, ibutilide is safe and effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients when used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioversion of AF/AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of multiple medications that can potentially prolong the QT interval, no patient experienced serious life-threatening rhythm disturbances or significant QT prolongation during ibutilide administration </plain></SENT>
