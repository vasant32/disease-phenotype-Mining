<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim was to characterize the coronary sinus (CS)-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> that occurred as the last residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and required ablation within the CS or great cardiac vein to restore sinus rhythm (SR) in patients with primary longstanding persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 23 patients in whom stable SR was restored by ablation inside the vein during the first or repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 23 subjects represented 23% of the 99 patients in whom SR was restored by ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> confined to the CS musculature was suggested in 8 (35%) patients, and a peri-mitral reentry circuit was present in 14 (61%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty (87%) patients have remained free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs for 33 +/- 10 (12-53) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A majority of the residual CS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> exhibit properties of reentry, one third utilizing the CS musculature as a reentry substrate independent of the atrial myocardium </plain></SENT>
