<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of BMS versus DES in terms of clinical events in large coronary vessels (≥3.0 mm) by performing a meta-analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six RCTs with 4,399 patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant between-group differences in the risks of the composite of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/MI), cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, however, DES was associated with significant reduction in the risk of target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared with BMS [0.48 (0.33, 0.70)] with consistent benefits among patients with reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.5 mm, reference vessel diameter ≥ 4.0 mm, stent length ≤ 15 mm, first-generation DES or second-generation DES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with ≥ 3-year follow-up, there were no significant between-group differences in the risk of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/MI, TVR, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that DES is superior to BMS in terms of adverse cardiac events in large coronary arteries at the mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The long-term efficacy of newer-generation DES versus BMS in larger coronary arteries is still worth further evaluation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
