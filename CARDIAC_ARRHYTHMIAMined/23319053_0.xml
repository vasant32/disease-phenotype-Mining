<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue-engineered cell sheet implantation has the potential to overcome some of these limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the transplantation of a muscle-derived stem cell (MDSC) sheet could improve the regenerative capacity of MDSCs in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MDSC sheet-implanted mice displayed a reduction in left ventricle (LV) dilation and sustained LV contraction compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MDSC sheet formed aligned myotubes and produced a significant increase in capillary density and a reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearts transplanted with the MDSC sheets did not display any significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the donor MDSC survival rate was higher than the direct myocardial MDSC injection group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDSC sheet implantation yielded better functional recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarcted myocardium without any significant arrhythmic events compared with direct MDSC injection, suggesting this cell sheet delivery system could significantly improve the myocardial regenerative potential of the MDSCs </plain></SENT>
