<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of collimation to the 'minimal required field size' on clinically significant parameters of radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Radiation dose measured by dose area product (DAP) and radiation dose rate measured by DAP per minute of fluoroscopy were determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 571 electrophysiology procedures performed in a single electrophysiology laboratory from January 2010 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from 205 procedures performed by one interventional electrophysiologist, who instituted a practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field on a case-by-case basis, were compared with data from 366 procedures performed by the three other experienced interventional electrophysiologists using the laboratory who continued their existing practice of ad hoc collimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in radiation exposure were seen with the practice of routine maximal collimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The largest reductions were seen during 'simple' ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A practice of routinely collimating to the minimum required visual fluoroscopy field results in significant reductions in radiation exposure when compared with a usual approach to collimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> in patients and operators </plain></SENT>
