<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) has not been studied in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated early and midterm morbidity and mortality in adults undergoing TCPC and assessed risk factors for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1994 and October 2010, 30 adults (21.3 Â± 5.5 years) underwent TCPC (extracardiac conduit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients who had palliated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricles</z:hpo> underwent TCPC completions and 8 patients underwent TCPC conversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and perioperative data were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of 9 patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> or intraatrial reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were treated in the catheterization room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An aortic cross-clamp was necessary in 12 patients, and 16 TCPCs were fenestrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 51 months (range, 4-198 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 10%: 2 of 8 conversions and 1 of 22 completions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was 1 late conversion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (at 56 months postoperatively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 4 patients required pacemakers and 1 patient required long-term antiarrhythmic medication, but no heart transplantations were necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for early mortality were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), aortic cross-clamp (p = 0.054), and extracorporeal circulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for overall mortality were conversion (p = 0.047), absence of fenestration (p = 0.036), surgery before January 2006 (p = 0.036), aortic cross-clamp (p = 0.018), extracorporeal circulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (p = 0.008), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association functional class had improved at the last follow-up: preoperatively, 17 patients were in class II and 12 patients were in class III versus 18 patients in class I and 9 patients in class II postoperatively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At the last clinical visit, systemic ventricular function was maintained, and no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early and midterm TCPC results for adults are encouraging for completion but are disappointing for conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Identified risk factors for mortality should improve patient selection for TCPC </plain></SENT>
