<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and related electrophysiological remodeling has been proposed as a potential cause of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perioperative supplementation of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> has been evaluated as a preventive agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current investigation was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in CABG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind, single-institution study was conducted in nonemergency CABG patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were monitored for episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-nine treatment and 96 control subjects completed the study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative drugs were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical characteristics and postoperative medication use also were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 30.3% in the treatment group and 30.2% in the control group (P = .985) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in postoperative complications or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that supplementation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> in addition to routine postoperative care does not reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
