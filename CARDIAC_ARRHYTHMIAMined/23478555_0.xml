<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been long-standing debate as to whether intense endurance exercise provokes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage and whether cardiac remodeling associated with long-standing endurance training is entirely physiological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of concrete evidence on either side, the potential for serious clinical consequences, including life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, elevates the importance of the debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies have taught us that elite athletes enjoy excellent health, and athletic animal models consistently show up-regulation of molecular pathways, which are free of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and entirely different from those induced through pathological cardiac loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, extreme exercise has been associated with biochemical and functional evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> damage, and some recent imaging techniques raise the possibility of small areas of myocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> appear to be more prevalent amongst endurance athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only large prospective trials will enable us to really assess the health benefits and risks of regular intense endurance sports </plain></SENT>
