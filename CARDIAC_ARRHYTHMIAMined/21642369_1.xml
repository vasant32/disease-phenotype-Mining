<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alert settings appear to be a crucial parameter of its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate various settings for alerts and alert message management in patients with pacemakers and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively evaluated 282 patients (181 males, 101 females, mean age 72 ± 11 years) who were referred to nine electrophysiological centres in the Veneto region of Italy for a pacemaker (76 patients) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (206 patients) implant in which remote monitoring was activated (Biotronik Home Monitoring®, Biotronik, Berlin, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 382 ± 261 days, we received 106,039 transmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pacemaker group, the alerts that were most frequently activated were those concerning battery exhaustion, surveying impedances, sensing and threshold measurements, as well as missing transmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-cardiac resynchronization therapy group, the alerts nearly always activated were those concerning a detection setoff, battery exhaustion, critical values of impedance, or ineffective maximum energy shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, the alarms for heart rate monitoring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were activated in fewer cases at higher variability among centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that more attention is paid to critical technical data than to patients' clinical profiles, probably to limit an excessive flow of data into the centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accurate alert settings, personalized to the patients' features, are essential for easier and more effective management of patients who are followed remotely </plain></SENT>
