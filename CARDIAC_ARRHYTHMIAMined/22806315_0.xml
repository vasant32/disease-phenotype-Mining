<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, a new approach of QRS complex detection without the stage of noise suppression was developed and evaluated, which was based on the combination of two techniques: matched filtering and triangle character analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Firstly, a template of QRS complex was selected automatically by the triangle character in ECG, and then it was time-reversed after removing its direct current component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondly, matched filtering was implemented at low computational cost by finite impulse response, which further enhanced QRS complex and attenuated non-QRS regions containing P-wave, T-wave and various noise components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, triangle structure-based threshold decision was processed to detect QRS complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And RR intervals and triangle structures were further analyzed for the reduction of false-positive and false-negative detections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm was tested on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 48 records of the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the detection rate reached 99.62 %, the sensitivity got 99.78 %, and the positive prediction was 99.85 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the proposed method was able to identify QRS complexes reliably even under the condition of poor signal quality </plain></SENT>
