<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which this inflammatory cytokine participates in the pathology of the heart are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well established that alterations in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) handling are involved in cardiac dysfunction during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, but it is unknown whether CT-1 modulates [Ca(2+)](i) handling in adult cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we have analyzed for the first time the effects of CT-1 on [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis in adult rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: L-type calcium current (I(CaL)) was recorded using patch-clamp techniques, and [Ca(2+)](i) transients and Ca(2+) sparks were viewed by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 1 nM CT-1 for 20-60 min induced a significant increase in I(CaL) density, [Ca(2+)](i) transients, and cell shortening compared with control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals that CT-1 increases I(CaL) by a protein kinase A-dependent mechanism, and Ca(2+) sparks by a Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II-dependent and protein kinase A-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes treated with CT-1 exhibited a higher occurrence of arrhythmogenic behaviour, manifested as spontaneous Ca(2+) waves and aftercontractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that cardiomyocytes treated with CT-1 present high spontaneous Ca(2+) release during diastole, a mechanism linked to arrhythmogenicity in the pathologic heart </plain></SENT>
