<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The Kir 6.1 K(atp) channel is believed to play an important role in ventricular repolarization as determined from both functional and genetic studies of the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> inwardly-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 8 (KCNJ8)-S422L missense mutation in patients with J-wave syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although Kir6.1 is also present in atrial tissue, it is unknown whether this channel modulates atrial repolarization and hence whether the S422L mutation portends a greater risk of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to examine whether there was an increased frequency of the KCNJ8-S422L mutation among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and early repolarization (ER) as a possible novel susceptibility gene for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 325 lone AF probands were identified from the Vanderbilt AF Registry, a collection of clinical data and DNA from consented, consecutively enrolled participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coding regions of KCNJ8 were sequenced, and the patient's presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) was reviewed by two independent physicians for ER abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The KCNJ8-S422L mutation was identified in two AF probands while no other candidate gene variants were identified in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (7%) patients were found to have ER on the ECG, including the two probands carrying the S422L variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one small AF kindred, the S422L variant co-segregated with AF and ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The KCNJ8-S422L variant is associated with both increased AF susceptibility and ER indicating a role for Kir 6.1 K(atp) channel in both ventricular and atrial repolarization </plain></SENT>
