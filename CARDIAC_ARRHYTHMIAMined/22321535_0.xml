<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Epicardial (Epi) activation of the left ventricular (LV) wall increases transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR), which creates a substrate for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that pacing from the LV mid-myocardium may decrease the TDR and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A transmural electrocardiogram and transmembrane action potentials were simultaneously recorded from Epi, mid-myocardial (M), and endocardial (Endo) layers of the arterially perfused canine LV wedge preparations (n= 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmural dispersion of repolarization varied when the preparations were paced at each layer, respectively (Endo pacing, 35.6 ± 6.6 ms; M pacing, 34.9 ± 7.3 ms; Epi pacing, 72.4 ± 4.9 ms; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was noted in TDR between M pacing and Epi pacing (P&lt; 0.001), but not between M pacing and Endo pacing (P= 0.831) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result was reproducible in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion experiments (n= 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transmural dispersion of repolarization was amplified as compared with non-ischaemic experiments and differed when preparations were paced at each layer (Endo pacing, 62.8 ± 13.8 ms; M pacing, 63.3 ± 13.3 ms; Epi pacing, 111.1 ± 17.7 ms; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was again no significant difference between Endo pacing and M pacing (P= 0.948) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as pacing was shifted from M to Epi, there was a significant increase in TDR (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced in two of eight ischaemic preparations during Epi pacing, but did not occur in either M or Endo pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mid-myocardial pacing can significantly decrease the TDR and prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> as compared with Epi pacing </plain></SENT>
