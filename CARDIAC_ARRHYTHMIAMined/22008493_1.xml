<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>), has been reported to have antiarrhythmic and antiinflammatory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine whether the combination of antiarrhythmic drugs and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> reduced the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 50 patients with paroxysmal AF (age, 54 ± 9 years) after excluding the clinical conditions associated with an increased risk of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were initially treated with antiarrhythmic drugs for 6 months (the observation period), and thereafter, <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> was added at a dose of 1.8 g/day for 6 months (the intervention period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a one-year period, patients obtained an ECG recording using a portable device each morning and when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptom occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point was the difference of the AF burden (defined by the days of AF per month) between observation period and intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the AF burden before and after intervention (2.6 ± 2.2 days/months vs. 2.5 ± 2.2 days/months, P = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> level was significantly increased (42 ± 15 μg/mL to 120 ± 47 μg/mL, P &lt; 0.001), CRP level was unchanged (1.04 ± 0.69 mg/L to 0.96 ± 0.56 mg/L, P = 0.24) following <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> in combination with antiarrhythmic drugs did not reduce the AF burden or the CRP levels in paroxysmal AF patients who had no evidence of substantial structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
