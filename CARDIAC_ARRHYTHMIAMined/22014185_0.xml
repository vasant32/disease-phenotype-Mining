<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> and subsequent re-oxygenation are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may be partly explained by perturbations in cytosolic calcium concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4), a calcium-activated non-selective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channel, is functionally expressed in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on its biophysical properties, it is likely to participate in EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, modulators of TRPM4 activity may influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible anti-arrhythmic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28820">9-phenanthrol</z:chebi>, a TRPM4 inhibitor in a murine heart model of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and re-oxygenation-induced EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mouse heart was removed, and the right ventricle was pinned in a superfusion chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a period of normoxia, the preparation was superfused for 2 h with a hypoxic solution and then re-oxygenated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous electrical activity was investigated by intracellular microelectrode recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: In normoxic conditions, the ventricle exhibited spontaneous action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Application of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and re-oxygenation protocol unmasked <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced EADs, the occurrence of which increased under re-oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of these EADs was reduced by superfusion with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42638">flufenamic acid</z:chebi>, a blocker of Ca(2+) -dependent <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels or with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28820">9-phenanthrol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Superfusion with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28820">9-phenanthrol</z:chebi> (10(-5) or 10(-4)  mol·L(-1) ) caused a dramatic dose-dependent abolition of EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> and re-oxygenation-induced EADs can be generated in the mouse heart model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28820">9-Phenanthrol</z:chebi> abolished EADs, which strongly suggests the involvement of TRPM4 in the generation of EAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This identifies non-selective <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi> channels inhibitors as new pharmacological candidates in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
