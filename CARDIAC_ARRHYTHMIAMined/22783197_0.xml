<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of this maladaptive <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> include cardio-respiratory dysfunction that may be reflected in <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> and ventilatory pattern variabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed signal-processing algorithms that quantify non-linear deterministic characteristics of variability in biologic signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Now, coalescing under the aegis of the NIH Computational Biology Program and the Society for Complexity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Illness, two research teams performed iterative experiments and computational modeling on <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cardio-pulmonary dysfunction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> as well as on neural control of respiration and ventilatory pattern variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These teams, with additional collaborators, have recently formed a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary consortium, whose goal is to delineate the fundamental interrelationship between the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and physiologic variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multi-scale mathematical modeling and complementary physiological experiments will provide insight into autonomic neural mechanisms that may modulate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and simultaneously reduce heart rate and ventilatory pattern variabilities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach integrates computational models of neural control of breathing and cardio-respiratory coupling with models that combine <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cardiovascular function, and heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting integrated model will provide mechanistic explanations for the phenomena of respiratory sinus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and cardio-ventilatory coupling observed under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, and the loss of these properties during <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach holds the potential of modeling cross-scale physiological interactions to improve both basic knowledge and clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and trauma </plain></SENT>
