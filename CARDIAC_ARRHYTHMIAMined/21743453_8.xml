<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">Carvedilol</z:chebi> is one of the most effective beta blockers for preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmias in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, but the mechanisms underlying its favorable antiarrhythmic benefits remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous Ca(2+) waves, also called store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR), evoke ventricular tachyarrhythmias in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> is the only beta blocker tested that effectively suppresses SOICR by directly reducing the open duration of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This unique anti-SOICR activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, combined with its beta-blocking activity, probably contributes to its favorable antiarrhythmic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To enable optimal titration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>'s actions as a beta blocker and as a suppressor of SOICR separately, we developed a new SOICR-inhibiting, minimally beta-blocking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> analog, VK-II-86 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VK-II-86 prevented stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in RyR2-mutant mice and did so more effectively when combined with either of the selective beta blockers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combining SOICR inhibition with optimal beta blockade has the potential to provide antiarrhythmic therapy that can be tailored to individual patients </plain></SENT>
