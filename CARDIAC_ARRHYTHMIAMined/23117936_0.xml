<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The clinical yield of cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) radiofrequency ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF) is limited by a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AFib) in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among other acknowledged variables, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) could favor incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> control in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in reducing the occurrence of AFib after CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive AF patients undergoing CTI ablation were screened for OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationship of the following variables with the occurrence of AFib during follow-up (12 months) was investigated: CPAP initiation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, body mass index, underlying structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, left atrial diameter and AFib documentation prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We prospectively included 56 patients [age 66 (11) years, 12 female], 46 of whom (82%) had OSA and 25 (45%) had severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (38%) had AFib during follow-up after CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both freedom from AFib prior to ablation and CPAP initiation in those patients without previously documented AFib at inclusion were associated with a reduction of AFib episodes during follow-up (p = 0.019 and p = 0.025, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inversely, CPAP was not protective from AFib recurrence when this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was documented prior to ablation (p = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> is a prevalent condition in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CPAP is associated with a lower incidence of newly diagnosed AFib after CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Screening for OSA in AF patients appears to be a reasonable clinical strategy </plain></SENT>
