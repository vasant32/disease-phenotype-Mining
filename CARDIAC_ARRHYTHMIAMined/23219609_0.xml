<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts have been made, with the use of epidemiologic data and controlled exposures in diverse animal and human populations, to verify the relationship between air pollution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to examine and contrast the epidemiologic and toxicologic evidence to date that relates airborne pollutants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have explored the potential biological mechanisms driving this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the PubMed database, we conducted a literature search that included the terms "air pollution" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>" and eventually divergent synonyms such as "particulate matter," "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>," and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>." We reviewed epidemiologic studies and controlled human and animal exposures independently to determine whether observational conclusions were corroborated by toxicologic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numerous pollutants have demonstrated some arrhythmic capacity among healthy and health-compromised populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, some exposure studies have shown no significant correlation of air pollutants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which suggests some uncertainty about the arrhythmogenic potential of air pollution and the mechanisms involved in arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While data from an increasing number of controlled exposures with human volunteers suggest a potential mechanistic link between air pollution and altered cardiac electrophysiology, definite conclusions regarding air pollution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> are elusive as the direct arrhythmic effects of air pollutants are not entirely consistent across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
