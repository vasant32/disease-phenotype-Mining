<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> fails to restore euthyroidism, possibly due to mixed cases of AIT type 1 and 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29222">ClO</z:chebi>(4)) might be useful because <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29222">ClO</z:chebi>(4) reduces the cytotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on thyrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to demonstrate the feasibility of continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in AIT type 2 and to evaluate the usefulness of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29222">ClO</z:chebi>(4) (given alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>) in AIT type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized multicenter study was conducted in 10 Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with AIT type 2 were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 30 mg/d (group A, n = 12), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> 500 mg twice daily (group B, n = 14), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> (group C, n = 10); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients continued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and were also treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> 30 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment efficacy (defined as TSH values â‰¥ 0.4 mU/liter under continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>) and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial therapy was efficacious in 100, 71, and 100% of groups A, B, and C, respectively (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 29% failures in group B became euthyroid after addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither the time to reach TSH of 0.4 mU/liter or higher [8 wk (4-20), 14 wk (4-32), and 12 wk (4-28) in groups A, B, and C respectively] nor the time to reach free T(4) of 25 pmol/liter or below [4 wk (4-20), 12 wk (4-20), and 8 wk (4-20) in groups A, B, and C) were significantly different between groups (values as median with range) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> occurred in 8.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Euthyroidism was reached despite continuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> remains the preferred treatment modality of AIT type 2, because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49706">perchlorate</z:chebi> given alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> had no better outcomes </plain></SENT>
