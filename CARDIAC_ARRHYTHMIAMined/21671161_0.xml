<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> since 2007 with indapamide, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi>-like <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His laboratory data had not been tested for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week before his first visit, he suffered from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">common cold</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was admitted to our hospital because his electrocardiogram showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011841'>ventricular flutter</z:hpo>, and pulmonary arrest occurred at the time of his visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>Hypokalemia</z:hpo> (K, 1.7 mEq/L) was considered as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His oral intake of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> decreased, but <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> loss from the kidney persisted (urinary <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, 14.0 mEq/L; transtubular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> gradient, 5.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> was suspected to have been present for a long time due to indapamide, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> was induced during the period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of indapamide and intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> L: -<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> supplementation, the patient's serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels increased and his general condition improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although it is well known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> is caused by indapamide, the incidence is not frequent and if observed is not severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we experienced an unusual case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>-induced fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> caused by indapamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, the serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentration of patients under the drug, especially anorexic elderly patients, should be monitored </plain></SENT>
