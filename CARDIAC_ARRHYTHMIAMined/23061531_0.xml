<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi>-A (CsA) is a potent inhibitor of opening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore, which has been shown to play a key role in myocardial reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of this treatment on clinical outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the clinical outcomes of using this drug in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> receiving thrombolytic treatment (TLT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 101 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> who were candidate for TLT, were enrolled and randomly assigned into treatment or control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the treatment group received an intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg/kg of CsA immediately before TLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients in the control group received an equivalent volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size, occurrence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), TLT-related complications, in-hospital and 6 month mortality rates were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the demographics, myocardial enzyme release, occurrence of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> [9(18%) vs. 12(23.5%), p= 0.80], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> [18(36%) vs. 19(38.3%), p= 0.83], LVEF at first day [34.7±9.9% vs. 33.5±8.1%, p= 0.50] or at discharge [37.7±10% vs. 36.1±8.2%, p= 0.43], and in-hospital [4(8%) vs. 6 (11.8%), p= 0.74] or 6-month mortality rates [9(18%) vs. 10(19.6%), p= 0.99] between the CsA vs. the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study the pre-thrombolytic administration of CsA was not associated with a reduction in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size or any improvement in clinical outcomes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd </plain></SENT>
