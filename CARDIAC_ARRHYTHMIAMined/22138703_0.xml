<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ozone (O₃) is a well-documented respiratory oxidant, but increasing epidemiological evidence points to extrapulmonary effects, including positive associations between ambient O₃ concentrations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: With preliminary reports linking O₃ exposure with changes in heart rate (HR), we investigated the hypothesis that a single inhalation exposure to O₃ will cause concentration-dependent autonomic modulation of cardiac function in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats implanted with telemeters to monitor HR and cardiac electrophysiology [electrocardiography (ECG)] were exposed once by whole-body inhalation for 4 hr to 0.2 or 0.8 ppm O₃ or filtered air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A separate cohort was tested for vulnerability to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> 24 hr after exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Exposure to 0.8 ppm O₃ caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, PR prolongation, ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and substantial increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature beats</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010520'>sinoatrial block</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, accompanied by concurrent increases in several HR variability parameters that were suggestive of increased parasympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-O₃ exposure failed to elicit any overt changes in autonomic tone, heart rhythm, or ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, both 0.2 and 0.8 ppm O₃ increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> formation, suggesting a latent O₃-induced alteration in myocardial excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: O₃ exposure causes several alterations in cardiac electrophysiology that are likely mediated by modulation of autonomic input to the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, exposure to low O₃ concentrations may cause subclinical effects that manifest only when triggered by a stressor, suggesting that the adverse health effects of ambient levels of air pollutants may be insidious and potentially underestimated </plain></SENT>
