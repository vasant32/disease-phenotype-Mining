<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using wavelet transform of ECG, we can calculate the energy proportion of QRS complexes in multiple scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiograms (ECGs) were used as the experimental data, which were collected from a young (21-34 yr) group and an elderly (68-81 yr) group of healthy subjects, as well as from a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients (66-81 yr). the data analysis was performed with the energy proportion of the QRS complexes in the ECG using Mexican-Hat as a mother wavelet in multiple scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the energy proportion of the QRS complexes had no changes with ages increasing (P &gt; 0.44), but in the same age group, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients' energy proportion of the QRS complexes near 17Hz are obviously less than that in the healthy group (P &lt; 0.01), so the energy proportion of the QRS complexes calculated by wavelet analysis can be used as a feature index to judge whether a person is a sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patient or not </plain></SENT>
