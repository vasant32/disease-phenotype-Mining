<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study is to determine the risk factor for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after Fontan operation with regard to ventricle dominancy and hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, the data of the patients including age, weight, dominant ventricle, type of cardiac anomaly, previous operations, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), duration of aortic clamping, cardiac rhythm, pulmonary artery pressure, the Nakata Index, systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve insufficiency were obtained from the hospital records, the echocardiographic files, and cardiac catheterization records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to dominant left ventricle or dominant right ventricle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed in 21 (52.5%) patients in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed in patients with a right atrial pressure of &lt;5 mmHg, whereas postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in patients with a right atrial pressure of ≥5 mmHg (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the effects of preoperative and postoperative pulmonary artery pressures on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were evaluated, postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was determined in only 2 (12.5%) of 8 patients with a preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≤9 mmHg, whereas postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed in 19 (59.3%) of 32 patients with a preoperative pulmonary artery pressure of ≥10 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure of &gt;10 mmHg increased the risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was determined in 8 (53%) of 15 patients with a dominant right ventricle, and in 13 (52%) of 25 patients with a dominant left ventricle (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While a preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure of &gt;10 mmHg and a preoperative right atrial pressure of &gt;5 mmHg were the risk factors for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in patients undergoing Fontan procedure, the right or left ventricular dominance was not a risk factor </plain></SENT>
