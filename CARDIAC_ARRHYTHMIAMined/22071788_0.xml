<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral (looking) and physiological (heart rate and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) measures were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Boys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> looked equally as much as chronological age-matched peers at nonsocial stimuli, but less at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Boys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and language age-matched peers differed in patterns of looking at live versus videotaped <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Boys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> demonstrated faster heart rates than chronological age-matched peers, but did not differ significantly on respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced attention during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CDS</z:e> may restrict language-learning opportunities for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heart rate findings suggest that young children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> have a nonspecific elevated arousal level </plain></SENT>
