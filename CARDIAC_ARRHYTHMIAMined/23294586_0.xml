<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective To prospectively investigate the diagnostic accuracy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> of prospectively electrocardiogram-triggered spiral acquisition mode (high pitch mode) dual-source computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with relatively higher heart rates (HR) compared with catheter coronary angiography (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods Forty-seven consecutive patients with relatively higher HR (&gt;65 and &lt;100 bpm) (20 male, 27 female; age 55±10 years) who both underwent dual-source CTCA and CCA were prospectively included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were performed CTCA using high pitch mode setting at 20%-30% of the R-R interval for the image acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> coronary segments were evaluated by two blinded and independent observers with regard to image quality on a three-point scale (1: excellent to 3: non-diagnostic) and for the presence of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenoses</z:e> (defined as diameter narrowing exceeding 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considered CCA as the standard of reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiation dose values were calculated using the dose-length product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Image quality was rated as being score 1 in 92.4% of segments, score 2 in 6.1% of segmentsand score 3 in 1.5% of segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average image quality score per segment was 1.064±0.306 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HR variability of patients with image score 1, 2 and 3 were 2.29±1.06 bpm, 5.17±1.37 bpm, 8.88±1.53 bpm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average HR variability of patients with different image scores were significantly different (F=170.402, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 92.6%, 97.0%, 87.6%, 98.3%, respectively, per segment and 90.0%, 95.2%, 85.3%, 96.9%, respectively, per vessel and 100%, 63.6%, 90.0%, 100%, respectively, per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effective radiation dose was on average 0.86±0.16 mSv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion In patients with HR more than 65 bpm and below 100 bpm without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the prospectively electrocardiogram-gated high-pitch spiral acquisition mode with image acquired timing set at 20%-30% of the R-R interval provides a high diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenoses</z:e> combined with a 1.5% of non-diagnostic coronary segments and a radiation dose below 1 mSv </plain></SENT>
