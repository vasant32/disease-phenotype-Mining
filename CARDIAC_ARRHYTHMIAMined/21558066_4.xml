<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>Supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (SVA) are common after thoracic surgery and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of perioperative <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on the development of postoperative SVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred patients undergoing thoracotomy for lobectomy, bi-lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or oesophagectomy were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment group received <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (5 g daily) intraoperatively, and on days 1 and 2 after operation, the control group received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of the study was the development of SVA within the first 5 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 100 patients in each arm of the study, with one withdrawal and three lost to follow-up in the treatment group and four withdrawals in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six patients received <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and 96 received placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of SVA between the treatment and control groups, 16.7% (16/96) vs 25% (24/96), P=0.16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the predefined subgroup analysis, patients at highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (those undergoing pneumonectomy) had a significant reduction in the frequency of SVA, 11.1% (2/18) vs 52.9% (9/17), P=0.008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in hospital length of stay or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving i.v. <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> experienced a higher frequency of minor side-effects (stinging at injection site) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The treatment was otherwise well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, prophylactic <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> did not reduce the incidence of SVA in patients undergoing thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, it reduced the incidence of SVA in the high-risk cohort of patients undergoing pneumonectomy </plain></SENT>
