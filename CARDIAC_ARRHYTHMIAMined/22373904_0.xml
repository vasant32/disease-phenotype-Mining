<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether AF ablation reduces the long-term risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A coding algorithm was used to identify AF patients treated with catheter ablation (n=3194) or antiarrhythmic drugs without ablation (n=6028) between 2005 and 2009 using The MarketScan Research Database from Thomson Reuters From this sample, 801 pairs were propensity matched, based on 15 demographic and clinical characteristics and baseline medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalizations for up to 3 years were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with catheter ablation had a significantly lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (3.4% per year) than a group of patients with AF managed with antiarrhythmic drugs only (5.5% per year), with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44-0.86; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization were 1.5% per year in the ablation group and 2.2% per year in the antiarrhythmic drug group, with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.42-1.15; P=0.158) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were minimally altered in Cox proportional hazards models, which further adjusted for potential confounders not well balanced by the propensity matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large propensity-matched community sample, AF ablation was associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalizations compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings require confirmation with randomized study designs </plain></SENT>
