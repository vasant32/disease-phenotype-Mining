<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the QRS vector in the vectorcardiogram (VCG) reflects electric interventricular dyssynchrony, and that the QRS vector amplitude (VAQRS), halfway between that during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) and LV pacing, reflects optimal resynchronization, and can be used for easy optimization of CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 24 canine hearts with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> (12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), the LV was paced over a wide range of atrioventricular (AV) delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface ECGs were recorded from the limb leads, and VAQRS was calculated in the frontal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical interventricular dyssynchrony (MIVD) was determined as the time delay between upslopes of LV and right ventricular pressure curves, and systolic function was assessed as LV dP/dtmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VAQRS and MIVD were highly correlated (r=0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The VAQRS halfway between that during LV pacing with short AV delay and intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> activation accurately predicted the optimal AV delay for LV pacing (1 ms; 95% CI, -5 to 8 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increase in LV dP/dtmax at the VCG predicted AV delay was only slightly lower than the highest observed LV dP/dtmax (-2.7%; 95% CI, -3.6 to -1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inability to reach the halfway value of VAQRS during simultaneous biventricular pacing (53% of cases) was associated with suboptimal hemodynamic response, which could be corrected by sequential pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The VAQRS reflects electric interventricular dyssynchrony and accurately predicts optimal timing of LV stimulation in canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, VCG may be useful as a reliable and easy tool for individual optimization of CRT </plain></SENT>
