<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This research was aimed at studying the sequence of depolarization along the atrial epicardium and formation of the cardioelectric field on the body surface of hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out on eleven ISIAH rats (with hereditary stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed spatial-temporal characteristics of body surface potential map (BSPM), time characteristics of electrocardiogram during atrial depolarization, sequence of atrial epicardial depolarization of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using independent samples t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results indicated that in 27% of hypertensive rats in the pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) sleeves, early excitation areas are formed 2.0 ± 0.5 ms after the beginning of depolarization of the sino-atrial node area, in 73% of animals, the area of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeves is excited 6.5 ± 0.4 ms after the beginning of depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experimental animals, the beginning of inversion of areas of positive and negative cardioelectric potentials on BSPM does not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 73% of rats, duration of inversion on BSPM was 7.7 ± 1.9 ms, and in 27% - 3.9 ± 0.1 ms (p=0.011) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> results in actual risk of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which originate at the base of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In rats with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, two early depolarization zones are revealed in the sinus node area and in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> return to the left atrium, projected on BSPM by mutual positions of negative and positive potential zones </plain></SENT>
