<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of TMCC against <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30514">cesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the rabbit heart and find whether the antiarrhythmic activity is related to inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early afterdepolarization was induced by 1.5 mM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30514">cesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (1 ml kg(-1)) through intravenous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The monophasic action potentials (MAP) and electrocardiograms were simultaneously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of TMCC on functional refractory periods (FRPs) in the left atrium was also observed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was significantly retarded by TMCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contractions</z:mp> and incidence of monophasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and polyphasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 10 min were decreased by TMCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects can be abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (10 μg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAP duration at 90% repolarization was significantly prolonged by TMCC, which can be prolonged even longer by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (10 μg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments showed that FRPs was prolonged by TMCC which can be cancelled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (10 μg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TMCC prevents <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30514">cesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, in part, contributes to the antiarrhythmic effect of TMCC </plain></SENT>
