<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the actual risk for patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) to experience a clinically relevant venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> (VAE) during surgery performed in the semisitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed between January 2008 and December 2009, under general anesthesia and in the semisitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and capnometry were used intraoperatively to monitor for air bubbles in the venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 200 consecutive patients who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were operated on in the semisitting position, 52 patients (26%) had a diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates of VAE in patients were graded as follows: grade 0 (no air bubbles visible, no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>), 23 patients (44.2%); grade I (air bubbles on TEE), 22 patients (42.3%); grade II (air bubbles on TEE with decrease of end-tidal carbon dioxide [ETCO2] ≤3 mm Hg), 2 patients (3.8%); grade III, air bubbles on TEE with decrease of ETCO2 &gt;3 mm Hg, 4 patients (7.7%); grade IV, air bubbles on TEE with decrease of ETCO2 &gt;3 mm Hg and decrease of mean arterial pressure ≥20% or increase of heart rate ≥40% (or both), 1 patient (1.9%); and grade V, VAE causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 0 patients (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in this series, and no new or unexplained, mild or severe neurologic deficits were caused by a VAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under standardized anesthesia and neurosurgical protocols, patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> can be operated on safely in the semisitting position </plain></SENT>
