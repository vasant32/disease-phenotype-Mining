<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2004 to 2009, 80 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronary arteries evidenced by coronary angiography and CSF were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSF patterns were evaluated by the corrected TIMI frame count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned at 1:1 ratio to diltiazem sustained-release capsules treatment group (Dil, 90 mg twice daily) or placebo control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Holter, liver and kidney function, treadmill exercise test, coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography were measured at baseline and after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiovascular events (re-admission or progress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was evaluated during the 6 months follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients in control and 40 patients in Dil group completed the 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no medication induced drug withdraw during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction was similar between the 2 groups at baseline and during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was significantly lower in Dil group than in control group and there was no symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and II and III degree atrioventricular conduction block in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement was observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, treadmill exercise test and coronary blood flow in Dil group while these parameters remained unchanged in control group at the end of 6 months follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diltiazem slow-release capsules improved coronary blood flow and alleviated <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> in patients with CSF </plain></SENT>
