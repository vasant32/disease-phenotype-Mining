<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The potential health benefits of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) usually are studied using a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This combination reduces vulnerability to experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA have differential effects when taken alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a model of pacing-induced atrial hemodynamic overload, we investigated the individual effects of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA on vulnerability to AF and atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four dogs were randomized into 3 groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which underwent simultaneous atrial and ventricular pacing at 220 beats per minute for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One group received purified DHA (≈1 g/d) orally for 21 days beginning 7 days before pacing began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 1 group received ≈1 g/d purified <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a third (control) group (No-PUFAs), 8 dogs received ≈1 g/d olive oil, and 12 were unsupplemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological and echocardiographic measurements were taken at baseline and 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atrial tissue samples were collected at 21 days for histological and molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistent AF inducibility was significantly reduced by DHA compared with No-PUFAs median [25-75 percentiles], 0% [0%-3%] for DHA versus 3.1% [2.2%-11%] for No-PUFAs; P=0.007) but not by <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> (3.4% [1.9%-8.9%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DHA also reduced atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> compared with No-PUFAs (11 ± 6% versus 20 ± 4%, respectively; P&lt;0.05), whereas <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> did not (15 ± 5%; P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DHA is more effective than <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> in attenuating AF vulnerability and atrial remodeling in structural remodeling-induced AF </plain></SENT>
