<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>Pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (PE) can occur during or after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation, and may induce atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterize the impact of PE on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences following AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients referred for a first radiofrequency AF ablation were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before and 24h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If PE was present, transthoracic echocardiography was repeated at 1 month to evaluate PE evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences (EARs) were defined as any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> documented within 1 month of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PE was diagnosed in 18/81 patients (22%); and was present in significantly more patients with persistent versus paroxysmal AF (14/40 [35%] vs 4/41 [10%]; P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PEs were mild (mean 6 Â± 3mm), mainly asymptomatic (89%), and none required pericardiocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences were present in 25/81 (31%) and 29/81 (36%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PE was significantly higher among patients with EARs versus those without (12/25 [48%] vs 6/56 [11%]; P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By multivariable analysis, PE and duration in AF were the two independent predictors of EARs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PE incidence was similar in patients with and without late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 1 month, no patients had PE on transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PE following radiofrequency AF ablation is frequent, particularly following persistent AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This effusion is generally mild, mainly asymptomatic, and independently associated with EARs </plain></SENT>
