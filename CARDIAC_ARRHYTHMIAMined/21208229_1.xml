<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined if constantly moving the OITC (perpetual motion) when using 50 W increases ablation cure rates without increasing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated procedural data, complications, and individual procedure cure rates (IPCRs) for AF ablation using closed tip catheters (CTC) versus OITC at 40, 45, and 50 W in 1,122 ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used "perpetual motion" to move the OITC at 50 W every 3-10 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The OITC showed higher IPCR than CTC at 45 W (P = 0.012) and 50 W (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the OITC, IPCR increased from 44.6% to 60.7% as power increased from 40 to 50 W (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OITC appeared superior to the CTC for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For paroxysmal AF, increasing OITC power from 40 to 50 W provided no increase in IPCR (70.6% vs 71.2%, P = 0.827) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For persistent AF, increasing power from 40 to 50 W increased IPCR from 34.5% to 59.5% (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were similar for the CTC and the OITC at any power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OITC at 50 W had shorter procedure, left atrial, and fluoroscopy times (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increasing OITC power from 40 to 50 W increases IPCR with no increase in complications as long as the 50 W setting is done using "perpetual motion." The OITC 50 W power setting results in shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times and should be considered for AF ablations </plain></SENT>
