<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to report the safety and long-term efficacy of irrigated-tip magnetic ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Catheter ablation was remotely performed using a new irrigated-tip magnetic catheter (ThermoCool NaviStar-RMT, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) in 130 consecutive patients (mean age 59.7 ± 10.5 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal (81 patients) or persistent (49 patients) AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiofrequency (RF) generator was set to fixed power of 30 W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of the study was freedom from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT)/AF off antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was safely performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conventional ablation targets, but crossover to manual catheters was required in 12 patients to complete the mitral isthmus line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total procedure time was 94.6 ± 15.3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Impedance values significantly decreased during RF applications (P &lt; .001) and the maximum temperature on the catheter tip was 36.4°C ± 0.8°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up duration was 15.3 ± 4.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was achieved in 66 of 81(81.4%) patients with paroxysmal AF and in 33 of 49 (67.3%) with persistent AF (P = .035, by log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with paroxysmal AF had higher late AF recurrence (P =.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, postablation incessant left AT developed in 7 of 130 (5.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major complications were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Left atrial diameter (P &lt; .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (P = .032) predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence after remote irrigated-tip ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remote ablation with irrigated-tip magnetic catheters can be safely and effectively performed in patients with AF, but longer follow-up periods are required to evaluate late AF recurrences </plain></SENT>
