<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the long-term results of using a cryopreserved homograft for an aortic root or aorta and its branch replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 1995 to January 2010, 23 patients (male:female=15:8, 45.4±15.6 years) underwent a homograft replacement in the aortic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical techniques used were aortic root replacement in 15 patients and aortic graft interposition in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for the use of a homograft were systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (n=15) and complicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of clinical follow-up was 65±58 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early mortality occurred in 2 patients (8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications included atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (n=3), and low cardiac output syndrome (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late mortality occurred in 6 patients (26.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 66.3% and 59.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (28.6%) suffered from homograft-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early results of homograft replacement in aortic position were favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, close long-term follow-up is required due to the high rate of homograft-related events </plain></SENT>
