<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This is an observational multicentric prospective study of 352 patients implanted with EnPulse(®) DR pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 76.3 ± 9.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications of pacing were atrio-ventricular block (AVB) (64%) and sinus dysfunction (SD) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221047" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brady-tachy syndrome</z:e> (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The automatic atrial threshold monitoring function was maintained at nominal programming state with daily measurement scheduled at 1:00 am </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory automatic atrial threshold assessment was possible for 91.5% of patients at discharge, 97.3% at 2 months, and 95.7% at 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Causes of the unsuccessful attempts to perform automatic atrial threshold were atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or permanent atrial and ventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Feasibility is significantly better for AVB indication than SD indication due to more frequent occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At each stage, there is a strict correlation between the automatic measurements and those conducted manually by the physician with a P &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Feasibility of ambulatory automatic atrial threshold is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of the study show excellent correlation between the two methods for atrial threshold: there is no statistical difference between manual and automatic measurements during follow-up </plain></SENT>
