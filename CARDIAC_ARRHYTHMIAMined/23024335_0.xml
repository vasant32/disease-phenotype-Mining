<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The spatial QRS-T angle, which can be easily calculated from the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), might be useful in the prognostication in dialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to establish the prognostic value of the spatial QRS-T angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who initiated dialysis therapy between 2002 and 2009 in the hospitals of Leiden (LUMC) and Amsterdam (AMC) at least 3 months on dialysis were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spatial QRS-T angle was calculated, from a routinely acquired ECG, and its relationship with mortality was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was defined as ≥ 130° in men and ≥ 116° in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 277 consecutive patients (172 male, mean age 56.3 ± 17.0) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes [hazard ratio (HR) 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46-3.70] and especially a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.04-8.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an abnormal spatial QRS-T angle was of incremental prognostic value, when added to a risk model consisting of known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dialysis patients the spatial QRS-T angle is a significant and independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It implies that this parameter can be used to identify high risk patients </plain></SENT>
