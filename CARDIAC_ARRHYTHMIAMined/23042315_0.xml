<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a Holter-based non-invasive method for detecting cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> and is an independent, powerful predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in different patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effect of MetS on HRT in non-diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 80 non-diabetic MetS subjects and 50 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 130 subjects underwent a 24-h ambulatory Holter electrocardiogram recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two indices of HRT were analyzed: turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRT values were classified into 3 categories for risk stratification: 1) Category 0, TO and TS were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; 2) Category 1, either TO or TS was abnormal; 3) Category 2, both TO and TS were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When we compared MetS rates in the HRT risk stratification groups, there were significant differences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups as compared with the controls (Category 0 = MetS 28.8%, n = 15, Control 71.2%, n = 37, p 〈 0.001; Category 1 = MetS 80.8%, n = 42, Control 19.2%, n = 10, p 〈 0.001; Category 2 = MetS 88.5%, n = 23, Control 11.5%, n = 3, p 〈 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, TO and TS abnormalities were correlated with the number of MetS components (r = 0.608, p 〈 0.001; r = -0.388, p 〈 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish a relationship between HRT and MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MetS adversely affects HRT scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of MetS components is related to impaired HRT scores </plain></SENT>
