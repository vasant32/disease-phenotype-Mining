<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interaction between cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and TR has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of pre-implant TR, and worsened TR post-implant, on response to CRT and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with successfully implanted CRT systems between 2007 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups pre-implant: (Gp 1) no-or-mild TR; and (Gp 2) moderate-or-severe TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-implant, patients were divided into two groups: (Gp A) improved or stable TR; and (Gp B) worsened TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical and echocardiographic outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study included 193 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five subjects (18%) had moderate or severe TR pre-implant (Gp 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline echo parameters and 6 min walk distance were worse in Gp 2 compared with Gp 1 (mild or no TR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in clinical response to CRT between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, Gp 2 had a significantly lower echocardiographic response (35 vs. 60%, P = 0.01) and higher mortality over 3 years (OR = 6.70, 95% CI = 1.8-24.5, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Post-implant, 25 patients (13%) developed worsened TR (Gp B), not associated with deterioration in right ventricle function or elevation in pulmonary artery pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Worsened TR predicted a reduced clinical response to CRT (42 vs. 70%, P = 0.006), when compared with Gp A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of baseline moderate or severe TR is associated with increased mortality but does not predict clinical or echocardiographic response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with worsened TR following CRT are less likely to clinically respond to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pacing leads passing through the tricuspid valve may worsen TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that avoidance of lead-induced TR by alternative implantation techniques could improve the response rate to CRT </plain></SENT>
