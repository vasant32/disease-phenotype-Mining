<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) is generally associated with deterioration of the clinical status, functional capacity, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies evaluating the effectiveness of AF ablation in this cohort are relatively scant, have included relatively few patients, and their results are somewhat conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AF in patients with HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients (10 females; mean age 48.7 ± 11 years) with drug-refractory paroxysmal (n = 14), persistent (n = 7), or long-persistent (&gt; 1 year; n = 9) AF were prospectively recruited into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, 13 patients were in NYHA class II, and 6 patients were in NYHA class III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean atrial volume was 180 ± 47 mL, interventricular septum thickness was 20.5 ± 6.3 mm, and left atrial area was 29.8 ± 6.2 cm2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation protocol was adjusted to the clinical and electrophysiological status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation and bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, left atrial linear lesions were created and complex fragmented atrial potentials were ablated in patients with persistent and long-persistent AF, as well as during repeated procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 12 months, stable sinus rhythm (SR) was present in 16 (53%) patients, significantly more frequently in patients with paroxysmal AF (71% in SR) compared to those with persistent (57.1% in SR) or long-persistent (22% in SR) AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of AF burden was observed in 85.7% of patients with paroxysmal AF, 71.4% of patients with persistent AF, and 55.5% of patients with long-persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Single procedure success rate was 33% (10 patients), and repeat ablation procedures were performed in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No periprocedural complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were noted in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence during the follow-up, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 1 patient and peripheral embolism in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In both these patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> worsening was observed during these events, and anticoagulation was inadequate in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five of 16 patients in whom stable SR was observed during the follow-up were off antiarrhythmic drug therapy at final evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the other 6 patients, antiarrhythmic drug therapy was continued due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Successfully treated patients more often had paroxysmal AF (successful ablation: paroxysmal AF in 10 of 16 patients; unsuccessful ablation: paroxysmal AF in 4 of 14 patients; p = 0.009) and were younger (45 ± 11.5 years vs. 52.6 ± 9.2 years; p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, a trend toward a reduced need for cardioversion at the end of the procedure was also observed in these patients (3 patients in the successful ablation group vs. 8 patients in the unsuccessful ablation group; p = 0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, paroxysmal AF was the only independent predictor of a successful outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of AF in patients with HCM is an effective and safe therapeutic option, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of ablation is significantly smaller in patients with persistent AF and even more so in those with long-persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Repeated procedures were often necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Continued antiarrhythmic drug therapy is often required due to a significant degree of atrial remodelling </plain></SENT>
