<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Water-soluble polymeric 3-alkylpyridinum salts (poly-APS), isolated from the marine sponge Reniera sarai, are <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33243">natural products</z:chebi> with promising biomedical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their ability to form non-specific cell membrane pores raises safety issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the direct toxic effects of poly-APS on the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the impact of poly-APS toxicodynamics on vascular function, the relaxation and contraction responses of isolated rat thoracic aortas incubated in poly-APS solutions (0.01-10 μM) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cardiac toxicity was studied by measuring coronary flow, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release rate, left ventricular pressure, heart rate, and the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in isolated rat hearts perfused with poly-APS (0.001-1 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poly-APS diminished endothelium-dependent relaxation and contraction in a concentration- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was affected earlier and to a greater extent than contractile responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in isolated hearts the most evident cardiotoxic effects were observed after perfusion with the highest concentration (1 μM) of poly-APS: compared to the control group the coronary flow and heart rate were diminished by 2.2- and 1.8-fold, while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release rate and left ventricular pressure were increased by 7.8- and 2.2-fold (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, poly-APS had evident proarrhythmogenic activity in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the low concentration range (1-10 nM) poly-APS showed only minor toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results confirmed the direct toxic effects of poly-APS on the rat cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the use of poly-APS as therapeutic adjuvants has limited safety margins </plain></SENT>
