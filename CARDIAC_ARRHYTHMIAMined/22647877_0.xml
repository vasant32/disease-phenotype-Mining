<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Troponin mutations that increase myofilament Ca sensitivity are associated with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and confer a high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In mice, Ca sensitization causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that myofilament Ca sensitization increases cytosolic Ca buffering and to determine the resulting arrhythmogenic changes in Ca homeostasis in the intact mouse heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using cardiomyocytes isolated from mice expressing troponin T (TnT) mutants (TnT-I79N, TnT-F110I, TnT-R278C), we found that increasing myofilament Ca sensitivity produced a proportional increase in cytosolic Ca binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying cause was an increase in the cytosolic Ca binding affinity, whereas maximal Ca binding capacity was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect was sufficiently large to alter Ca handling in intact mouse hearts at physiological heart rates, resulting in increased end-diastolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22984,29320">[Ca]</z:chebi> at fast pacing rates, and enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca content and release after pauses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, action potential (AP) regulation was altered, with postpause action potential prolongation, afterdepolarizations, and triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Ca sensitization with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> 57033 mimicked the effects of Ca-sensitizing TnT mutants and produced pause-dependent ventricular ectopy and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myofilament Ca sensitization increases cytosolic Ca binding affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A major proarrhythmic consequence is a pause-dependent potentiation of Ca release, action potential prolongation, and triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased cytosolic Ca binding represents a novel mechanism of pause-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that may be relevant for inherited and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
