<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characterization of RA in health and identification of physiological RA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may help discrimination of abnormal RA cases more likely associated to arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, aim of the present study was the identification of a physiological RA region in terms of mean temporal location (MRAD) with respect to the T apex, and mean amplitude (MRAA), by application of our heart-rate adaptive match filter method to clinical ECG recordings from 51 control healthy (CH) subjects and 43 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that RA occurring within the first half of the T wave is dominant in both CH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> populations (74.5% and 53.5% of cases, respectively; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Definition of physiological RA region in the MRAD vs. MRAA plane (-83 ms ≤ MRAD ≤ 23 ms, 0≤ MRAA ≤ 30 μV) provided 0% and 32.6% abnormal RA cases among the CH subjects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> may associate with an RA occurring early (MRAD&lt;-83 ms) or late (MRAD &gt;23 ms) along the JT segment, in addition or in alternative to an abnormally high RA amplitude (MRAA &gt;30 μV) </plain></SENT>
