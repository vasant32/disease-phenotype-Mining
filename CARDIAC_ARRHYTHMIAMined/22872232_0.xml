<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine (Ran) is a novel anti-ischemic agent with electrophysiologic properties mainly attributed to the inhibition of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current and atrial-selective early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are only limited data regarding its efficacy and mechanism of action against <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (Afl) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to investigate the electrophysiologic mechanism of Ran in a rabbit model of inducible atrial tachyarrhythmias elicited by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were produced in 19 rabbits by rapid atrial burst pacing during control, after intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and after Ran + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recording of right atrial monophasic action potentials (MAPs) and programmed stimulation were utilized to determine the duration of atrial repolarization at various cycle lengths and voltage levels of action potential, including 75% of total MAP duration (MAPD75), effective refractory period (ERP), and postrepolarization refractoriness (PRR = ERP - MAPD75) prior to and after Ran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control stimulation yielded no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or maximal nonsustained runs of Afl/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, 17 of 19 rabbits exhibited sustained Afl and AF as well as mixed forms of Afl/AF, while 2 animals revealed none or short runs of nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-frequency burst pacing during the first 30 minutes after Ran + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> failed to induce any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 13 of 17 rabbits (76%), while 2 animals displayed sustained Afl/AF and 2 other animals nonsustained Afl/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At basic stimulation cycle length of 250 milliseconds, Ran prolonged baseline atrial ERP (80 ± 8 vs 120 ± 9 milliseconds, P &lt; .001) much more than MAPD75 (65 ± 7 vs 85 ± 7 milliseconds, P &lt; .001), leading to atrial PRR which was more pronounced after Ran compared with control measurements (35 ± 11 vs 15 ± 10 milliseconds, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This in vivo study demonstrates that Ran exerts antiarrhythmic activity by suppressing inducibility of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-mediated Afl/AF in intact rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its action may predominantly be related to a significant increase in atrial PRR, resulting in depressed electrical excitability and impediment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> initiation </plain></SENT>
