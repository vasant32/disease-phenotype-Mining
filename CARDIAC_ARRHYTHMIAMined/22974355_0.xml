<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic effect of 1 has been demonstrated in different experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, daurisoline (1) prolonged action potential duration (APD) in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> use-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the electrophysiological mechanisms for 1-induced prolongation of APD have not been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the direct effect of 1 was investigated on the hERG current and the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing the hERG channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was shown that 1 inhibits hERG current in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of 10 μM 1, steady-state inactivation of V(1/2) was shifted negatively by 15.9 mV, and 1 accelerated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blockade of hERG channels was dependent on channel opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression and function of hERG were unchanged by 1 at 1 and 10 μM, while hERG expression and the hERG current were decreased significantly by 1 at 30 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that 1, at concentrations below 30 μM, exerts a blocking effect on hERG, but does not affect the expression and function of the hERG channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may explain the relatively lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> after long-term usage </plain></SENT>
