<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite recent advances in diagnostic procedures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> remains unexplained in 15 to 35% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If implantable loop recorder is a validated diagnostic tool for unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, results of this strategy are largely issued from randomized studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We lack the results of surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report a single center experience with implantable loop recorders, in patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A device (Medtronic Reveal DX or XT) was implanted in 31 patients between January 2009 and January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 10.5±8.5 months, loop recording definitively determined that an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was the cause of symptoms in 10 patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (45%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In eight of the 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, during follow-up, no arrhythmic diagnosis could be made (one patient has been diagnosed as presenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and seven as having hypotensive vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six patients, the ILR showed an arrhythmic aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four other patients presented an abnormal ILR result without symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis included sinusal arrest in four patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in one patient, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in two patients, ventricular arrythmias in two patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> of 180/min in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therapy was instituted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, in whom an arrhythmic cause was found except one who refused the therapy (six pacemaker, two implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations, and one cryoablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> confirmed by an invasive exploration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this survey, implantable loop recorder implantation led to the diagnosis of an arrhythmic cause in 32% of patients and excluded an arrhythmic cause in 26% of patient with a mean follow-up of 10.5 months </plain></SENT>
