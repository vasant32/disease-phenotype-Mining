<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the current standard of interventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (Afib) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recurrence rate of Afib varies considerably after ablation between different series and is mainly attributed to the recovery of pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) conduction after initial successful PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Waiting longer during the initial PVI procedure and re-ablating any re-conduction may prolong procedure duration but should improve outcome with fewer relapses during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Circumferential PVI with radiofrequency energy according to an electro-anatomical reconstruction of the left atrium and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 107 consecutive patients who were presented to our hospital for circumferential PVI, were randomly assigned to prolongation of the waiting period (n= 54, 50.5%) or immediate termination of the procedure after initial successful isolation (n= 53, 49.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ablation was started in an alternating manner at the lateral (n= 51, 47.7%) or septal veins (n= 56, 52.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had paroxysmal (n= 70, 65.4%) and persistent Afib (n= 37, 34.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 gaps occurred in 27 patients (50%) during 1 h after initial successful PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Without any blanking period 24 patients (44.4%) were free of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the wait group and 23 patients (43.4%) in the stop group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (29.6 and 30.2%) underwent re-ablation for symptomatic recurrences of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With re-ablation 45 patients (83.3%) were free of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the wait group and 46 patients (86.8%) in the stop group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition there was no difference in the type of recurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> recovery was considerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, immediate re-ablation of early re-conduction did not result in a reduced recurrence rate of Afib during follow-up </plain></SENT>
