<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) may present during fetal development and can be life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism for the unusual early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of LQTS during fetal development is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to elucidate the molecular basis for severe fetal LQTS presenting at 19 weeks' gestation, the earliest known presentation of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fetal magnetocardiography was used to demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> and a prolonged rate-corrected QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro electrophysiological studies were performed to determine functional consequences of a novel SCN5A mutation found in the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fetus presented with episodes of ventricular ectopy progressing to incessant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001789'>hydrops fetalis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis disclosed a novel, de novo heterozygous mutation (L409P) and a homozygous common variant (R558 in SCN5A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro electrophysiological studies demonstrated that the mutation in combination with R558 caused significant depolarized shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation and activation, faster recovery from inactivation, and a 7-fold higher level of persistent current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the mutation was engineered in a fetal-expressed SCN5A splice isoform, channel dysfunction was markedly potentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, R558 alone in the fetal splice isoform evoked a large persistent current, and hence both alleles were dysfunctional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report the earliest confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic LQTS and present evidence that mutant cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel dysfunction is potentiated by a developmentally regulated alternative splicing event in SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the unusual severity and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in fetal LQTS </plain></SENT>
