<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ideal technique for addressing partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage into the superior vena cava (SVC), with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011567'>sinus venosus atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>), is debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of sinus node dysfunction, systemic, or pulmonary venous channels obstruction has led to different techniques being developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with 45 patients operated on using a vertical transcaval approach, without atrial or cavoatrial junction incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2001 and 2010, 45 patients (28 females, 17 males, with a mean age of 5 years (range, 8 months to 70 years), underwent operations using 1 patch of autologous pericardium, after vertical SVC incision anterior to the anomalous pulmonary veins: 43 had associated <z:mp ids='MP_0010408'>sinus venosus ASD</z:mp>, and 6 had associated left SVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Access was through sternotomy in 19 and right posterior thoracotomy in 26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional right atrial incision, without crossing the cavoatrial junction, was used in 2 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 76 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean cross-clamp time was 44 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or important morbidities occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 4.4 years (range, 2 months to 9.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had regular echocardiographic examination, electrocardiogram, and midterm 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed unobstructed caval and pulmonary venous flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The vertical transcaval approach is a simple, highly reproducible technique for correction of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage into the SVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It yields excellent results, with unobstructed pulmonary and systemic venous flow and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It can also be performed through a cosmetic right posterior thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
