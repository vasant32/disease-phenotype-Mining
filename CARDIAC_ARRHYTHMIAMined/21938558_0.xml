<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the electrophysiologic characteristics of Crista terminalis (CT) and their implication in the pathogenesis of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 27 New Zealand rabbits were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using standard glass microelectrode technique, cellular action potentials (APs) of CT and pectinate muscle (PM) were recorded in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Tyrode's perfusion and Tyrode's perfusion with 4 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal conduction velocity (V(L)) and transverse conduction velocity (V(T)) of CT were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As our data show, CT tissue had a trend of spontaneous phase IV depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction anisotropy (V(L)/V(T)) of CT was 4.53 ± 0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of the AP of CT was longer than that of PM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APD(20) and APD(90) for CT were 28.1 ± 3.5 and 145.3 ± 7.1 ms; and for PM cells were 21.8 ± 4.1 and 125.3 ± 6.3 ms, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The early and delayed action depolarizations were recorded after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A fast paroxysmal irregular rhythm was recorded which could be arrested by 0.1 mmol/l Isoptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was, therefore, concluded that the latent autorhythmicity, trigger activity, and conduction properties of CT might provide the electrophysiologic basis for the occurrence and sustenance of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
