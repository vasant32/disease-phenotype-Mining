<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of NS5806 on canine atrial versus ventricular tissues and myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: NS5806 (10 μM) was evaluated in arterially perfused canine right atrial and right ventricular wedge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ventricular wedges NS5806 (10 μM) accentuated phase 1 in epicardium (Epi), with little effect in endocardium (Endo), resulting in augmented J-waves on the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, application of NS5806 (10 μM) to atrial preparations had no effect on phase 1 repolarization but significantly decreased upstroke velocity (dV/dt) and depressed excitability, consistent with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current and voltage-clamp recordings were made in the absence and presence of NS5806 in (10 μM) enzymatically dissociated atrial and ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ventricular myocytes, NS5806 increased I(to) magnitude by 80% and 16% in Epi and Endo, respectively (at +40 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In atrial myocytes, NS5806 increased peak I(to) by 25% and had no effect on the sustained current, I(Kur)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under control conditions, I(Na) density in atrial myocytes was nearly double that in ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NS5806 caused a shift in steady-state mid-inactivation (V(1/2)) from -73.9 ± 0.27 to -77.3 ± 0.21 mV in ventricular and from -82.6 ± 0.12 to -85.1 ± 0.11 mV in atrial cells, resulting in reduction of I(Na) in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding putative I(Na) and I(to) channel subunits was evaluated by qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NS5806 produces a prominent augmentation of I(to) with little effect on I(Na) in the ventricles, but a potent inhibition of I(Na) with little augmentation of I(to) in atria </plain></SENT>
