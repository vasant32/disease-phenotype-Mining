<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From February 2004 to April 2010, our electronic database was searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had undergone bronchoscopic laser therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected data on age, gender, performance status, diagnosis leading to bronchoscopic laser treatment, number of procedures per patient, efficacy by means of extend of recanalisation and symptom improvement, additional interventions and procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-six procedures were performed in 121 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>17% of obstructions were localised in the trachea, 57% in main bronchi and 26% in lobar bronchi including right intermedius bronchus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sum of complete and partial recanalisation reached 95%, 80% and 68%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>26% of interventions in lobar bronchi were undertaken to treat haemoptysis which could be controlled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 6%; severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were seen in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed one treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (overall mortality 0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic laser therapy is a generally safe and effective method to regain airway patency in cases with tracheal or bronchial obstruction and to treat haemoptysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We observed clinical improvement in terms of reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> or controlled haemoptysis in 93% of our patients </plain></SENT>
