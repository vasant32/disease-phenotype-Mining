<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expedited treatment may influence the efficacy of nonfibrin specific thrombolytic agents in restoring early patency of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related artery (IRA), which is a major determinant of survival after ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a randomized double blind clinical trial comparing an accelerated infusion (1.5 MU/20 min; group A, n = 200) with the conventional infusion (1.5 MU/60 min; group B, n = 100) of streptokinase (SK) in 300 patients with their first episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical reperfusion rates, angiographic study findings, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), in-hospital morbidity and mortality and one year mortality were compared between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 59 Â± 12 years (79% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in baseline data between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical, electrocardiographic and physiologic reperfusion indices revealed significant faster and higher reperfusion rates and better preserved LVEF at discharge in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three percent of patients in either group underwent invasive coronary angiography at a mean of 5 days with comparable findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the second day, in-hospital and late mortalities rates occurred more frequently in group B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, accelerated SK infusion was the only independent predictor of higher electrocardiographic reperfusion (OR = 3.2, CI: 1.93-5.3, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The accelerated SK infusion regimen of 1.5 MU in 20 min is safe and well tolerated with significantly faster and higher clinical reperfusion rates, more preserved LV systolic function, less atrial and ventricular sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and less in-hospital and 1 year mortality rates in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
