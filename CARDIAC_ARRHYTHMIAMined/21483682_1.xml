<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are associated with the formation of spiral and scroll waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue; single spiral and scroll waves are believed to be associated with VT whereas their turbulent analogs are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the study of these waves is an important biophysical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a systematic study of the combined effects of muscle-fiber rotation and inhomogeneities on scroll-wave dynamics in the TNNP (ten Tusscher Noble Noble Panfilov) model for human cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, we use the three-dimensional TNNP model with fiber rotation and consider both conduction and ionic inhomogeneities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that, in addition to displaying a sensitive dependence on the positions, sizes, and types of inhomogeneities, scroll-wave dynamics also depends delicately upon the degree of fiber rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find that the tendency of scroll waves to anchor to cylindrical conduction inhomogeneities increases with the radius of the inhomogeneity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the filament of the scroll wave can exhibit drift or meandering, transmural bending, twisting, and break-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the scroll-wave filament exhibits weak meandering, then there is a fine balance between the anchoring of this wave at the inhomogeneity and a disruption of wave-pinning by fiber rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If this filament displays strong meandering, then again the anchoring is suppressed by fiber rotation; also, the scroll wave can be eliminated from most of the layers only to be regenerated by a seed wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ionic inhomogeneities can also lead to an anchoring of the scroll wave; scroll waves can now enter the region inside an ionic inhomogeneity and can display a coexistence of spatiotemporal chaos and quasi-periodic behavior in different parts of the simulation domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We discuss the experimental implications of our study </plain></SENT>
