<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Electrocardiographic criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo> are sometimes not visible on ECG in sinus rhythm (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the significance of unapparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo> in SR, when overt conduction through accessory pathway (AP) was noted at atrial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anterograde conduction through atrioventricular AP was identified at electrophysiological study (EPS) in 712 patients, studied for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n=316), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (n=89) or life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=55) or asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo> (n=252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG in SR at the time of EPS was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 78 patients (11%) (group I) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG in SR and anterograde conduction over AP at atrial pacing; 634 (group II) had overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> in SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group I was as frequently asymptomatic (35%) as group II (35%), had as frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as group II (43, 5, 2% vs 43, 13, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AP was more frequently left lateral in group I (57%) than in group II (36%)(p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AV re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), antidromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were induced as frequently in group I (54, 18, 10%) as in group II (54, 27, 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Malignant forms (induced AF with RR intervals between preexcited beats &lt;250ms in control state or &lt;200ms after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>) were as frequent in group I (11.5%) as II (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of unapparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo> represents 11% of our population with anterograde conduction through an AP and could be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk to have a malignant form is as high as in patients with overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo> in SR </plain></SENT>
