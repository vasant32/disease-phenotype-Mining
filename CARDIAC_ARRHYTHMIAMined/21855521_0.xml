<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A high incidence of early repolarization (ER) pattern in the inferolateral leads has been reported in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (IVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BS) is characterized by J-point or ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and some patients with BS also have ER in the inferolateral leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical characteristics and effects of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blockade on ER between IVF patients with ER (early repolarization syndrome [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>]) and BS patients with or without ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> and 21 patients with BS were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ER was defined as an elevation of at least 0.1 mV from baseline in the QRS-T junction in the inferorolateral leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Provocative tests with <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blockers were conducted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> from BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were male and most patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> during sleep or low activity (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ER was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blockers in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> (13/14, 93%) and BS (5/5, 100%), whereas ST-segment elevation was augmented in the right precordial leads in the BS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of positive late potentials were significantly higher in the BS group (60%) than in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> group (7%) (P &lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Some similarities were observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> and BS, including gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> triggers, and response of ER to <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike the ST segment in the right precordial leads in BS, ER was attenuated in patients with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> and BS, suggesting a differential mechanism between ER in the inferolateral leads and ST elevation in the right precordial leads </plain></SENT>
