<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 66 year-old man was brought to the emergency room (ER) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and sphincter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> duration was about 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similar short duration episodes had been referred by his relatives during the last months, following small traumas; no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had been registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient told he was affected with BS, having already been diagnosed 5 years before, after performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) highly suggestive for it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had performed an electrophysiologic study, which had not shown any sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> after scheduled stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding together to the lack of symptoms had suggested a conservative treatment, notwithstanding that familiar history documented his father's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient was also affected with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination did not suggest any significant findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests, supra aortic Doppler ultrasound, electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain CT were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECG showed sinus rhythm with a heart frequency of 82 bpm, QRS axis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as well as atrioventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ST coved-type elevation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> pattern and repolarization abnormalities were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Holter ECG and Doppler echocardiography were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in presence of BS suggested the evaluation of this case report together with electrophysiolgists and neurologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) was implanted through left subclavian vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He was discharged eight days after hospitalization, diagnosis was "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> in patient affected with BS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmogenic risk stratification is necessary; the indication for implanting this device is obvious in symptomatic patients, whereas it is controversial in patients presenting only ECG patterns of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the above mentioned case report rises remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The finding of BS in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> indicates the opportunity of implanting a defibrillator and only clinical experience and common opinions may help doctors in taking the most appropriated, often difficult, decisions </plain></SENT>
