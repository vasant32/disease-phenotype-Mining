<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the influence of rigorous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring on outcomes is not yet clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 103 patients with symptomatic AF who underwent catheter ablation at a single academic medical center from 2002 to 2006 were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the success rate of catheter ablation, defined as the absence of any atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence lasting &gt;10 seconds at the clinical visit and electrocardiographic or long-term cardiac rhythm recording after a single procedure and after the last procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 153 procedures were performed, with a median of 1 (interquartile range 1 to 2) per patient as follows: 61 had 1, 35 had 2, 6 had 3, and 1 had 4 catheter ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was present in 23% of patients at 6 years after a single procedure and in 39% of patients after the last procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No clinical predictors of AF recurrence were recognized after a single procedure, whereas after the last procedure, in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, only nonparoxysmal AF (hazard ratio 1.92, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 3.47, p = 0.02) was a predictor of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AF recurrence at 6-year follow-up after catheter ablation in a selected group of patients with symptomatic drug-refractory AF was relatively high, with 2/3 of AF relapses occurring in the first year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strict clinical surveillance after catheter ablation should be considered to help guide clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
