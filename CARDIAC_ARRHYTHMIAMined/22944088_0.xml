<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive epicardial ablation via right minithoracotomy is an emerging option for patients with drug-refractory nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To guide the development of rational treatment algorithms, factors predisposing to recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> need to be quantified and eventually treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We addressed the association of the plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after minimally invasive ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 104 patients at follow-up after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery; the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was expressed as micromoles per liter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prospective follow-up was conducted through electrocardiogram Holter monitoring (average 18.5 ± 5.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analysis (high vs low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>) was based on the cutoff value for the last quartile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration (16 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time-to-event and diagnostic performance analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 89.4% at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level, persistent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and increased left atrial dimension independently predicted the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during the follow-up (adjusted Cox regression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence (stratified Kaplan-Meier, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value for elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (16 μmol/L) yielded a good diagnostic performance in the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.807) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level measured during the follow-up reliably predicts the risk of recurrence after epicardial ablation of nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> via minithoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specific treatments to reduce plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> could be considered in the future in these patients </plain></SENT>
