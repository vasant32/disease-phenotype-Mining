<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been demonstrated to improve the functional class of patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> if QRS width is &gt;120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Addition of an internal cardioverter defibrillator diminishes the prevalence of mortality of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The technique for CRT requires selective stimulation of the left ventricle (LV), commonly undertaken through the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This procedure is not always feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct His-bundle pacing (DHBP) might be an alternative for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were selected from a population with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> derived for CRT and internal cardioverter defibrillator insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those, patients in whom LV stimulation via the coronary sinus was not achievable and DHBP obtained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> disappearance were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct His-bundle pacing corrected basal conduction disturbances in 13 of the 16 patients (81%) selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients in whom DHBP was attempted, the electrode was not successfully fixed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the nine remaining patients, a definitive resynchronization by DHBP was achieved, with consequent improvement in functional class and parameters of LV function as assessed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct His-bundle pacing might be an alternative treatment for CRT in selected cases </plain></SENT>
