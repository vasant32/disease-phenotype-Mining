<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study was designed to compare long-term clinical outcomes and costs between video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and transcatheter Amplatzer occlusion (TAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study enrolled 294 patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) from April 2002 to April 2007, and 290 of these patients were followed up until April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 294 patients, 196 underwent VATS and 98 accepted TAO for <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were similar in terms of demographics and preoperative clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients in the VATS group had successful <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> closure, and 94 patients (94/98, 95.9%) in the TAO group had successful <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedure-related complications recorded was 1.5% in the VATS group compared with 10.2% in TAO group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cost per patient was $1,309.40 ± $312.20 in the VATS group and $3,415.80 ± $637.30 in the TAO group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or newly occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in either group during the fellow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Up to the latest follow-up, no late recanalization or residual shunting was documented, and heart structure returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level in the VATS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, residual shunting was detected in four more TAO patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed the long-term safety and efficacy of VATS clipping of <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Compared with TAO, <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> interrupted with VATS can achieve both excellent clinical results and satisfying cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cost for VATS is only a little more than one third the cost for TAO </plain></SENT>
