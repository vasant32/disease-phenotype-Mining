<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Septic wound complications are known to limit the ability of surgeons to perform primary fascial closure after damage control laparotomy (DCL) in patients with trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors preventing primary fascial closure after DCL in nontrauma patients, however, are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to identify these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Institutional research board approval was obtained to review the medical records of nontrauma patients undergoing DCL between December 2006 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who died before an attempt at fascial closure were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was performed comparing patients with primary fascial closure to partial fascial or planned <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data are presented as median or percentage as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was considered at P &lt; .05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one patients were identified (53% male), of whom 8 died before an attempt at fascial closure, leaving 173 patients within the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary fascial closure was achieved in 111 patients (64%), with the remaining patients receiving either partial fascial or planned <z:hpo ids='HP_0002933'>ventral hernia</z:hpo> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rate of primary fascial closure plateaued by day 12 at 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who achieved primary fascial closure had a greater incidence of pre-existent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (32% vs 16%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (27% vs 11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a superior base deficit on admission (-7 vs -9) in the primary closure cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was equivalent mortality (21% vs 25%) and intensive care unit stay (9 days vs 14 days); however, the overall hospital stay (22 vs 42 days) and ventilator days (4 vs 6) in the primary fascial closure group were shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Success of primary fascial closure was associated with lower incidence of septic complications (39% vs 59%), enterocutaneous fistulae (4% vs 11%), and intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (14% vs 33%), as well as fewer days of open abdomen management (2 vs 6), and number of serial abdominal explorations (2 vs 4) and a lower fluid balance over the first 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of septic complications such as intra-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and enterocutaneous fistulae were associated with inability to primarily close the fascia after DCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, longer duration of open abdomen management, greater number of serial abdominal explorations, and worse base deficits were negatively associated with primary fascial closure </plain></SENT>
