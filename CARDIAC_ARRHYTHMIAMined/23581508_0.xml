<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although progress has been made toward identifying biological vulnerabilities to self-injury, mechanisms underlying psychosocial risk have received less attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared self-injuring adolescents (n = 17) with typical controls (n = 20) during a mother-child conflict discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dyadic interactions were coded using both global and microanalytic systems, allowing for a highly detailed characterization of mother-child interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed resting state psychophysiological regulation, as indexed by respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global coding revealed that maternal invalidation was associated with adolescent anger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, maternal invalidation and coerciveness were both related to adolescent opposition/defiance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from the microanalytic system indicated that self-injuring dyads were more likely to escalate conflict, suggesting a potential mechanism through which emotion dysregulation is shaped and maintained over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, mother and teen aversiveness interacted to predict adolescent resting RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low-aversive teens with highly aversive mothers had the highest RSA, whereas teens in high-high dyads showed the lowest RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with theories that emotion invalidation and conflict escalation are possible contextual risk factors for self-injury </plain></SENT>
