<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac vagal function can be indexed by the respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) - oscillations in heart rate linked to respiration mediated predominantly by fluctuations of vagus nerve efferent traffic originating in the nucleus ambiguus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the neurocardiac vagal modulation has been shown to be related to physiological adaptability/flexibity and emotional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, greater vagal withdrawal during stressors and subsequent recovery should be indicative of a more flexible physiological response system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the vagal inhibitory function plays a key role in the regulation of allostatic processes including the immune response (cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreased cardiovagal function (lower RSA) was shown to be associated with increased proinflammatory markers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase proteins indicating increased allostatic load and poor health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the study of the vagal-immune interactions could help illuminate the pathway via which psychosocial factors may influence health and disease </plain></SENT>
