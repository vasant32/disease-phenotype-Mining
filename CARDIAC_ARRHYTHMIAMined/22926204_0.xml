<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) with a wide QRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fragmented QRS (<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>) on a 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) has been shown to predict cardiac events in several patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationship between fragmented wide QRS (f-wQRS) and left ventricular dyssynchrony and response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients with HF undergoing CRT were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> was assessed using standardized criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dyssynchrony was defined as interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD) ≥40 ms and tissue Doppler velocity opposing-wall delay ≥65 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic response to CRT was defined by a ≥15 % reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume at 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fragmented wide QRS was present in 17 (32 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventricular and intraventricular dyssynchrony were highly prevalent in both patient groups with f-wQRS and nonf-wQRS (64.7 % vs 75 %, p = 0.44; 70.6 % vs 72.2 %, p = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic HF was significantly higher in patients with f-wQRS than patients with nonf-wQRS (64 % vs 33 %, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reverse remodeling was developed in 32 (89 %) and 6 (35 %) of patients with nonf-wQRS and f-wQRS, respectively (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, significant associates of response to CRT were evaluated adjusting for etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, QRS width, IVMD, intraventricular delay, and f-wQRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lack of f-wQRS was the only predictor of response to CRT (OR 1.556, 95 % CI, 0.016-0.806, p = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of dyssynchrony is necessary but not sufficient to select appropriate candidates for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Presence of f-wQRS on baseline ECG may play a role in identifying patients who may not respond to CRT </plain></SENT>
