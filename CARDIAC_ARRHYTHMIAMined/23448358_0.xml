<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies over the last few decades have reinforced the concept that cardiac fibroblasts are much more than simple homeostatic regulators of extracellular matrix turnover, but are integrally involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of the repair and remodelling of the heart that occurs following MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasticity of fibroblasts is due in part to their ability to undergo differentiation into myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts are specialised cells that possess a more contractile and synthetic phenotype than fibroblasts, enabling them to effectively repair and remodel the cardiac interstitium to manage the local devastation caused by MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to their key role in cardiac restoration and healing, persistence of myofibroblast activation can drive pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, myocardial stiffness and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to give an appreciation of both the beneficial and detrimental roles of the myofibroblast in the remodelling heart, to describe some of the major regulatory mechanisms controlling myofibroblast differentiation including recent advances in the microRNA field, and to consider how this cell type could be exploited therapeutically </plain></SENT>
