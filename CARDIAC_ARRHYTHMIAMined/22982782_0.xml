<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial steps in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> are not clear; however, it is likely that cardiac fibroblasts play an important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In immune cells, ATP release from pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels acts as a paracrine signal initiating activation of innate immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATP has been shown in noncardiac systems to initiate fibroblast activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that ATP release through Panx1 channels and subsequent fibroblast activation in the heart drives the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the heart following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified for the first time that Panx1 is localized within sarcolemmal membranes of canine cardiac myocytes where it directly interacts with the postsynaptic density 95/Drosophila disk large/zonula occludens-1-containing scaffolding protein synapse-associated protein 97 via its carboxyl terminal domain (amino acids 300-357) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> rapidly increased glycosylation of Panx1, resulting in increased trafficking to the plasma membrane as well as increased interaction with synapse-associated protein 97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular stress enhanced ATP release from myocyte Panx1 channels, which, in turn, causes fibroblast transformation to the activated myofibroblast phenotype via activation of the MAPK and p53 pathways, both of which are involved in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATP release through Panx1 channels in cardiac myocytes during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be an early paracrine event leading to profibrotic responses to ischemic cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
