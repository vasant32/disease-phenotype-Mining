<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Genetic long QT (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>) syndrome is a life-threatening disorder caused by mutations that result in prolongation of cardiac repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent work has demonstrated that a zebrafish model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> syndrome faithfully recapitulates several features of human disease, including prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, spontaneous early afterdepolarizations, and 2:1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in early stages of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of their transparency, small size, and absorption of small molecules from their environment, zebrafish are amenable to high-throughput chemical screens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a small-molecule screen using the zebrafish KCNH2 mutant breakdance to identify compounds that can rescue the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> type 2 phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Zebrafish breakdance embryos were exposed to test compounds at 48 hours of development and scored for rescue of 2:1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> at 72 hours in a 96-well format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only compounds that suppressed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> phenotype in 3 of 3 fish were considered hits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screen compounds were obtained from commercially available small-molecule libraries (Prestwick and Chembridge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial hits were confirmed with dose-response testing and time-course studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4 ANEPPS was performed to measure compound effects on cardiac action potential durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening of 1200 small molecules resulted in the identification of flurandrenolide and 2-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-N-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52556">4-methylphenyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi> (2-MMB) as compounds that reproducibly suppressed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping confirmed that treatment with each compound caused shortening of ventricular action potential durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Structure activity studies and steroid receptor knockdown suggest that flurandrenolide functions via the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a zebrafish model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> type 2 syndrome in a high-throughput chemical screen, we have identified 2 compounds, flurandrenolide and the novel compound 2-MMB, as small molecules that rescue the zebrafish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> type 2 syndrome by shortening the ventricular action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that flurandrenolide functions via the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor-mediated pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These 2 molecules and future discoveries from this screen should yield novel tools for the study of cardiac electrophysiology and may lead to novel therapeutics for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
