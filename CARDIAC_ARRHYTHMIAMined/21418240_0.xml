<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study investigated the overall mortality and the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) in 99 patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (NICM) and with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a stepwise regression model to identify independent risk factors for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a Cox regression model, independent risk factors for total mortality were evaluated and, subsequently, a Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of this study was the identification of independent predictors of overall mortality and the incidence of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five VT (≥310 ms), 51 fast VT (between 310 ms and 240 ms), and 48 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (≤240 ms) were documented in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> detected and treated by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> included female gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.4), lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy (OR 3.5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased serum creatinine</z:hpo> (OR 3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in survival between participants with or without VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total mortality was predicted by increased age (OR 2.3) and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> (OR 1.9), independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of NICM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, female gender, lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased creatinine</z:hpo> represented independent risk factors for the incidence of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and age favored total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering these results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> might represent a valuable noninvasive tool to identify NICM patients who, despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, have the highest risk of mortality and therefore require a particularly thorough follow-up </plain></SENT>
