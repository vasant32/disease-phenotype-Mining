<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> and Rgs5(-/-) mice were subjected to in vivo, in vitro, and cellular electrophysiological experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rgs5(-/-) mouse hearts showed significantly prolonged cardiac repolarization, including <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> and action potential duration (APD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents in ventricular myocytes of Rgs5(-/-) mice revealed significant reduction of the outward voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents, including I(peak), I(to,)I(Kur), and I(ss), compared to that in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcript and protein expression levels of Kv4.2, Kv4.3, Kv1.5, and Kv2.1 were downregulated in Rgs5(-/-) mouse ventricles compared with those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, electrically induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias were facilitated by Rgs5(-/-) in isolated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the increased incidence and duration of electrically induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias were associated with enhanced dispersion of APD and spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of I(peak), I(to) and I(Kur) between the epicardium and endocardium in the Rgs5(-/-) heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed the relationship between the absence of Rgs5 and cardiac electrophysiological abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results strongly indicate that Rgs5(-/-) induced prolonged repolarization and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which were closely related to the remodeling of voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
