<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ion channel dysfunction due to congenital or acquired defects has been linked to human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, defects in ion channel-associated proteins have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B is a multifunctional adapter protein responsible for targeting select ion channels, transporters, cytoskeletal proteins, and signaling molecules in excitable cells, including neurons, pancreatic Î²-cells, and cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B dysfunction has been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in human patients and ankyrin-B heterozygous (ankyrin-B(+/-)) mice with a phenotype characterized by sinus node dysfunction, susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> ("ankyrin-B syndrome") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, ankyrin-B(+/-) cells have defects in the expression and membrane localization of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase, Ca(2+) overload, and frequent afterdepolarizations, which likely serve as triggers for lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite knowledge gathered from mouse models and human patients, the molecular mechanism responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the setting of ankyrin-B dysfunction remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we use mathematical modeling to provide new insights into the cellular pathways responsible for Ca(2+) overload and afterdepolarizations in ankyrin-B(+/-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase play related, yet distinct, roles in intracellular Ca(2+) accumulation, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload, and afterdepolarization generation in ankyrin-B(+/-) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a human disease and are relevant for acquired human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, where ankyrin-B dysfunction has recently been identified </plain></SENT>
