<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> can result in the lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> characterized by a rapid heart rate and severely compromised cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many patients requiring medication present with serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> abnormalities due to a variety of conditions including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679407" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal dysfunction</z:e>, renal and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disorders, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> use, and aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> influences HERG channel inactivation and can alter block of HERG by some drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, block of HERG by a number of drugs is not sensitive to extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that block of WT HERG by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> and terfenadine, two drugs previously shown to be trapped inside the HERG channel after the channel closes, is insensitive to extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> over the range of 0 mM to 20 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi> block of the HERG mutant D540K, a mutant channel that is unable to trap drugs, is dependent on extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, correlates with the permeant ion, and is independent of HERG inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the lack of extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> dependency of block of HERG by some drugs may in part be related to the ability of these drugs to be trapped inside the channel after the channel closes </plain></SENT>
