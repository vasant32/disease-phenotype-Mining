<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> possess a common functional core, glitazone, which is considered a privileged scaffold upon which to build a drug selective for a given target--in this case, PPARÎ³ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we report a retrospective analysis of two variants of the glitazone scaffold, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, in an effort to identify off-target binding events in the rat heart to explain recently reported cardiovascular risk associated with these drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that glitazone has affinity for dehydrogenases, consistent with known binding preferences for related rhodanine cores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both drugs bound ion channels and modulators, with implications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional proteins involved in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, synaptic transduction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy production were detected and potentially contribute to drug efficacy and cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
