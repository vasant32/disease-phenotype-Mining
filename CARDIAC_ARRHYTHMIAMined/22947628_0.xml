<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of an implantable loop recorder for patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 18 patients, five of whom still have the device implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone extensive evaluation for their symptoms before getting the loop recorder implanted and this was therefore a highly select group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the thirteen patients where use of the device was completed, the mean age was 65±20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The loop recorder was in use for a mean time of 20±13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, eleven of thirteen, was the most common indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other two received the loop recorder for unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> during monitoring, three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further three had typical symptoms but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was recorded and excluding that as a cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had no symptoms the entire time they had the loop recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the five patients still with the device three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> as the indication for monitoring and two have the device as a means of evaluating the results of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study on our initial experience with implantable loop recorders shows that these devices can be useful in the investigation of the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
