<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> caused by mutations in desmosomal genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is often associated with life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some affected individuals develop progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and may require cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The explanted heart of a young adult with end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to a null allele in desmoglein-2 was studied at macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial samples were probed for junctional localization of desmosomal components and the gap junction protein connexin43 by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the protein content of desmosomal and adherens junction markers as well as connexin43 was assessed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological analysis confirmed ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the loss of specific immunoreactive signal for desmosomal components at the cardiac intercalated disks (shown for plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin-2), these proteins could be detected by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only for desmoglein-2, desmocollin-2, and plakoglobin were reduced protein levels observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adherens junction proteins were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lower phosphorylation levels were observed for connexin43; however, localization of the gap junction protein displayed regional differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, disease progression was more severe in the right ventricle compared to the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in the ARVC heart, plakoglobin is mainly redistributed from the junctions to other cellular pools and that protein degradation only plays a secondary role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Homogenous changes in the phosphorylation status of connexin43 were observed in multiple ARVC samples, suggesting that this might be a general feature of the disease </plain></SENT>
