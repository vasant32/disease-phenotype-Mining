<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autopsy is essential in the counselling of the bereaved, as the family of the victim may be at risk too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a nationwide setting operating under the same set of laws, we hypothesized that regional differences exist in the investigation of young persons dying suddenly and unexpectedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in persons aged 1-35 years in Denmark in 2000-2006 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> certificates were read independently by two physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>External examination as well as autopsy status was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant regional differences were found regarding external examinations and autopsy frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ratios of conducted external examinations varied between 63% and 93% (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autopsy ratios varied between 60% and 88% (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In urban areas, external examinations and autopsies were more often conducted than in rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In East Denmark, there were more external examinations resulting in a forensic autopsy, and there was a higher overall autopsy rate compared to West Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite operating under the same set of laws, we document significant regional differences in forensic investigations of young persons suffering a sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is probably not unique for Denmark although no data exist to confirm that </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results are worrying and call for a revision of the way these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> are handled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mandatory autopsy in sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in young persons is warranted as a thorough investigation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may help the clinician in guidance of the relatives in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
