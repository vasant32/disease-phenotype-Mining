<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three mammalian genes (SLC8A1, SLC8A2, and SLC8A3) and their splice variants are expressed in a tissue-specific manner to mediate Ca(2+)-fluxes across the cell-membrane and thus, significantly contribute to regulation of Ca(2+)-dependent events in many cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A long-wanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger has been recently identified as NCLX protein, representing a gene product of SLC8B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Distinct NCX isoform/splice variants contribute to excitation-contraction coupling, long-term potentiation of the brain and learning, blood pressure regulation, immune response, neurotransmitter and insulin secretion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> bioenergetics, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altered expression and regulation of NCX proteins contribute to distorted Ca(2+)-homeostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, renal Ca(2+) reabsorption, muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, high-resolution X-ray structures of Ca(2+)-binding regulatory domains of eukaryotic NCX and of full-size prokaryotic NCX have become available and the dynamic properties have been analyzed by advanced biophysical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular silencing/overexpression of NCX in cellular systems and organ-specific KO mouse models provided useful information on the contribution of distinct NCX variants to cellular and systemic functions under various pathophysiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selective inhibition or activation of predefined NCX variants in specific diseases might have clinical relevance, although this breakthrough has not yet been realized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms as well as the development of in vitro procedures for high-throughput screening of "drug-like" compounds may lead to selective pharmacological targeting of NCX variants </plain></SENT>
