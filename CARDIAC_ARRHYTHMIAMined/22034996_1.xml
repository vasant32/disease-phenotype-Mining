<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Beyond pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), adjuvant ablation at the sites of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) has been shown to improve the long-term success of catheter ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this approach often requires extensive ablation due to the widespread distribution of CFAE within the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An optimal strategy would identify areas of CFAE which, when selectively targeted with ablation, result in AF termination with an acceptable long-term freedom from AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the intraprocedural administration of an antiarrhythmic drug may help accomplish this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Modified Ablation Guided by Ibutilide Use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> AF (MAGIC-AF) Study is an international multicenter prospective randomized double-blinded clinical trial assessing the utility of the intraprocedural administration of 0.25 mg of intravenous ibutilide before performing CFAE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint of this study will be the freedom from AF at 1 year after a single procedure off antiarrhythmic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety endpoints will include procedural and radiofrequency ablation time as well as overall procedural complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing a first ever catheter ablation procedure for persistent AF will be included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo>, and ejection fraction &lt;35% will be excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients will first undergo PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those patients who remain in AF will then be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either 0.25 mg intravenous ibutilide or saline placebo followed by a CFAE based ablation strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two hundred randomized patients will be enrolled in this study-100 in each study arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The MAGIC-AF study will assess the utility of a combined pharmaco-ablative strategy in patients with persistent AF undergoing a CFAE based ablation strategy </plain></SENT>
