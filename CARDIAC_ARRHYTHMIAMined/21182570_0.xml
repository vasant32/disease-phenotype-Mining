<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded HRV in a sample of currently abstinent individuals with a history of METH dependence compared to age- and gender-matched drug-free comparison subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRV was assessed using time domain, frequency domain, and non-linear entropic analyses in 17 previously METH-dependent and 21 drug-free comparison individuals during a 5 minute rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The METH-dependent group demonstrated significant reduction in HRV, reduced parasympathetic activity, and diminished heartbeat complexity relative to comparison participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recent METH use was associated with increased sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> METH exposure may be associated with decreased HRV, impaired vagal function, and reduction in heart rate complexity as assessed by multiple methods of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss and review evidence that impaired HRV may be related to the cardiotoxic or neurotoxic effects of prolonged METH use </plain></SENT>
