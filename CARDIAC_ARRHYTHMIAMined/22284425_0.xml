<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the main reasons for this high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> toll is the severe lack of effective imaging techniques for screening, early detection and localization of an abnormality detected on the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two most widely used imaging techniques in the clinic are CT angiography and echocardiography with limitations in speed of application and reliability, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been established that the mechanical and electrical properties of the myocardium change dramatically as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, infarction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; both at their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and after survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite these findings, no imaging technique currently exists that is routinely used in the clinic and can provide reliable, non-invasive, quantitative mapping of the regional, mechanical, and electrical function of the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI) is an ultrasound-based technique that utilizes the electromechanical coupling and its associated resulting strain to infer to the underlying electrical function of the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methodology of EWI is first described and its fundamental performance is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent in vivo canine and human applications are provided that demonstrate the applicability of Electromechanical Wave Imaging in differentiating between sinus rhythm and induced pacing schemes as well as mapping <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preliminary validation with catheter mapping is also provided and transthoracic electromechanical mapping in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four chambers of the human heart is also presented demonstrating the potential of this novel methodology to noninvasively infer to both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological electrical conduction of the heart </plain></SENT>
