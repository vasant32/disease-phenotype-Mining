<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that isolated gastrointestinal complaints (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>), in the absence of other symptoms, were a common mode of initial presentation in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-eight patients younger than 18 years hospitalized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> at a single institution between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of their presenting complaints was recorded and analyzed according to 3 age groups: 0 to 1 year (infants), 1 to 10 years (children), and 11 to 18 years (adolescents) of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Respiratory symptoms were common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups (range, 56%-63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal complaints were also common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups (42%, 28%, and 65%, respectively) and were more frequent than respiratory complaints in adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adolescents were likely to present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> as their only complaint (10/43, 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>Chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> occurred rarely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal complaints are a common component of the presenting symptom complex of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adolescents, abdominal complaints occur more frequently than respiratory complaints and often in the absence of any other symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> in adults, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> occurs rarely at presentation in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the different presenting symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in children by primary providers is crucial to ensuring prompt diagnosis and timely initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
