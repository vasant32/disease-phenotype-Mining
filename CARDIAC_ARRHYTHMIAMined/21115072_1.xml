<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems are intricately connected and some of the cardioprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> are abolished by blocking the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the ability of six clinically available ARBs to specifically bind and activate the B2R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we investigated their ability to activate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> (PI) hydrolysis in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the B2R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> activated the B2R, working as a partial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> compared to the endogenous ligand bradykinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was blocked by the B2R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> HOE 140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A competitive binding analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> does not significantly compete with bradykinin and does not change the binding affinity of bradykinin on the B2R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">Candesartan</z:chebi> mimicked the ability of bradykinin to increase the recovery of contractile force after metabolic stress in rat atrial tissue strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> is a partial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> of the B2R through direct binding and activation, suggesting that B2R agonism could partly explain the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
