<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to retrospectively measure and compare estimated radiation doses between consecutive patient cohorts who underwent coronary imaging CT with 64- and 320-MDCT scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n = 4475) underwent imaging with 64-MDCT (n = 770) and 320-MDCT (n = 3705) scanners and were classified into one of five subgroups according to the patient heart rate and the image acquisition strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, image quality was subjectively evaluated using a 3-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated radiation dose and image quality were compared between subjects stratified by CT scanner and by subgroups imaged with each technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with a heart rate of 60 beats/min or less, the estimated radiation dose was halved (3.8 ± 2.0 vs 7.6 ± 2.6 mSv) when the 320-MDCT scanner (n = 2787) replaced the 64-MDCT scanner (n = 511) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the entire cohort, image quality score was significantly better (2.9 ± 0.4 vs 2.8 �� 0.5; p &lt; 0.0001) and the effective dose was significantly lower (4.9 ± 3.3 vs 9.9 ± 5.4 mSv; p &lt; 0.0001) for 320-MDCT scanners, compared with 64-MDCT scanners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Wide area-detector coronary CT angiography protocols have reduced radiation dose, with image quality maintained at the same level, compared with 64-MDCT technologies </plain></SENT>
