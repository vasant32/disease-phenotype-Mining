<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reports in the literature indicate that specialty clinics focusing on management of patients with specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorders have a significant positive impact on patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), one of the most common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, affects millions of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome data regarding the impact of managing patients with AF are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We established a specialty clinic focusing on management of patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of treating AF patients in this clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A team consisting of electrophysiologists and pharmacists designed a specific plan for managing and educating patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This plan consisted of evaluation, implementation of an individualized treatment plan, patient education, medication management, and follow-up care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the outcomes of patients who had clinic visits between November 2011 and March 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the incidence of AF-related hospitalizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy one patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of 71 patients, we identified 17 (23.9%) patients who were hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of these 17 hospitalized patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When compared to published data in the existing literature, managing AF patients in specialty clinics reduces the incidence of AF-related hospitalizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
