<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations that inhibit or up-regulate VGIC activities can dramatically interfere with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of several organs, leading to unpredictable failure and therefore poor quality of life or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many genomic variations that change amino acids in cytoplasmic domains of ion channels have been found to be associated with several diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a mechanism linking these mutations to ion channel malfunction has not been clearly established and in some cases is totally unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This concept article gives an overview on a possible mechanism by which disease-associated mutations in cytoplasmic domains of ion channels can affect channel activity by creating or disrupting phosphorylation sites for specific kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We call these events "ion channel phosphorylopathies" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding ion channel phosphorylopathies offers the opportunity to find a mechanism linking genomic variations to human disease and is crucial to the process of designing an effective pharmacological strategy </plain></SENT>
