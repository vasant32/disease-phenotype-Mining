<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main indication for the procedure is the occurrence of multiple shocks or electrical storm, while prophylactic ablation is only rarely performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The epicardial approach is seldom used and mostly only after failure of endocardial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main ablation strategy is targeting the clinical VT only by substrate mapping and ablation, and by targeting fractionated potentials with utilization of modern electroanatomical mapping systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Still, a considerable number of centres frequently perform the procedure using conventional mapping catheters only </plain></SENT>
