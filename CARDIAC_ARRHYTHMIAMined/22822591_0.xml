<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone inhibits both testicular and extratesticular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been approved in the European Union for use in this situation, in which treatment options are extremely limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation is based on a double-blind comparative trial of good methodological quality that included 1195 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival time was 4 months longer in the group treated with abiraterone + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) than in the group treated with placebo + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>): 15.8 versus 11.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>) reduced but did not eliminate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000859'>hyperaldosteronism</z:hpo> induced by abiraterone; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> occurred in 26.7% of patients, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 8.5%, and hypokalaemia in 17.1% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone was also associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (7.2% versus 4.6% with placebo) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (1% versus 0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone is metabolised by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> isoenzyme CYP3A4 and inhibits isoenzyme CYP2D6, resulting in a high potential for drug interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment is somewhat inconvenient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone must be taken between meals, serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels must be monitored, and care must be taken to avoid interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the known risks of abiraterone appear to be acceptable in view of its efficacy, but patients must be carefully monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abiraterone is one option to discuss with patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> after other treatments fail </plain></SENT>
