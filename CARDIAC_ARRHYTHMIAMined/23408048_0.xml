<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A regional geometry around Koch's triangle was constructed in 42 consecutive patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT), and a bipolar electrogram map was created with 72 ± 30 sampling points during sinus rhythm to identify sites with Haissaguerre's slow potentials (SPs) and His bundle electrograms (HBEs) to examine the anatomical and electrical variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was performed at the most prominent SP recording site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> results and long-term outcome were examined in comparison to another 42 consecutive patients who underwent a conventional fluoroscopy-guided slow pathway ablation in the previous months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The size of Koch's triangle and the coronary sinus ostium varied over a wide range of 132 to 490 and 69 to 346 mm(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HBEs were recorded linearly along the antero-septal right atrium (n = 29) or deviated downward toward the midseptum (n = 13, 31 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SPs were always distributed below the lowest HBE recording site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NavX-guided ablation eliminated AVNRT with a median of 1 radiofrequency pulse, 9.1 ± 4.6 min of fluoroscopy, and 49 ± 14 min of procedure time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were significantly smaller than those in fluoroscopy-guided ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related complications or long-term recurrence was noted in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Koch's triangle varies in terms of the size and electrogram distribution, and the NavX-guided slow pathway ablation overcomes the diversity and seems more effective than fluoroscopy-guided ablation </plain></SENT>
