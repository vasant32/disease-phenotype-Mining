<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) with cryoenergy has not been widely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of cryoablation for VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases where cryoablation of VA was attempted as the initial strategy or was considered to prevent potential damage to other structures such as the coronary arteries, phrenic nerve, and His bundle were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart or structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> undergoing VA ablation using cryoenergy at six different institutions were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epicardial access was obtained when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (7 men) underwent endocardial ablation, 13 (9 men) epicardial ablation (from the coronary sinus in 7), and 5 (2 men) aortic cusp ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 54 ± 8 years, and ejection fraction was 45% ± 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 15 (45%) patients, VAs were successfully ablated, whereas cryoablation was unsuccessful in the remaining 18 (55%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parahisian cases (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three patients, epicardial cryoablation was successful after several failed attempts with open irrigated catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred during catheter placement in the aortic cusp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At follow-up of 24 ± 5 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success were free from clinical VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of cryoenergy for ablation of VA has excellent success for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> near the His bundle; however, success rates at other sites appear less favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation may be considered as an alternative approach for reducing complications during ablation of VAs originating from sites close to other relevant cardiac structures (conduction system, coronary arteries, phrenic nerve) and, in rare cases, could be used epicardially when radiofrequency energy applications have failed </plain></SENT>
