<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping of cardiac electrophysiology combines high spatiotemporal resolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and physiological function with fast and simultaneous data acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If applied to the clinical setting, this could improve both diagnostic potential and therapeutic efficacy of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore this utility in vivo using a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we present a single-camera imaging and multiple light-emitting-diode illumination system that reduces economic and technical implementation hurdles to cardiac optical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined with a red-shifted calcium dye and a new near-infrared voltage-sensitive dye, both suitable for use in blood-perfused tissue, we demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo multi-parametric imaging of the mammalian heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our approach combines recording of electrophysiologically-relevant parameters with observation of structural substrates and is adaptable, in principle, to trans-catheter percutaneous approaches </plain></SENT>
