<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of (1) an arrhythmic end point, (2) tests in remodeled, predisposed tissue, and (3) testing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> drug influence on channel trafficking impairs on the drawn conclusions of these assays regarding drug safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the currently used human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-Ã -go-go-related gene assays, action potential duration, prolongation in multicellular preparations, or the QT interval have significant shortcomings in their prediction of an increased risk for drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, it will be proposed that beat-to-beat variability of repolarization quantified as short-term variability can (1) discriminate between safe and unsafe drugs even under predisposed and highly arrhythmogenic conditions despite accompanying QT prolongation and (2) identify the individual at risk for subsequent arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
