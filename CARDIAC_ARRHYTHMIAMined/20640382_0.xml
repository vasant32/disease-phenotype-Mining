<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in children and adolescents undergoing repair of TF, and to associate them with clinical aspects and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 37 patients undergoing repair of TF at Instituto Estadual de Cardiologia Aloysio de Castro (Rio de Janeiro) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After review of the medical records and clinical assessment, the patients underwent electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography (Echo), 24-h Holter monitoring and exercise test (ET), whose results were subjected to statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37 patients of whom 54% were males with a mean age of 9.7 ± 3.5 years and mean follow-up period of 4.7 ± 1.9 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities most frequently found were: on ECG: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> (89%); Echo: severe <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> (43%), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> (73%), moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (RVH, 57%); on ET: low exercise capacity (90%), impaired chronotropic response (40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (20%); on Holter monitoring: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (59%, of which 44% were ventricular, 38% supraventricular, and 24% both ventricular and supraventricular, with predominance of infrequent and benign <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients (15%) presented with multiform <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> with moderate and severe RVH (p=0.026), as well as with right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery gradient (RV/PA) &gt; 45 mmHg (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression analysis showed that increased RV/PA gradient was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was a common finding in a large proportion of children and adolescents after surgical repair of TF; however, it was infrequent and benign in most of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RV/PA gradient was considered a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
