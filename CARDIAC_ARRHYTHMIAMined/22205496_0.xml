<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the preliminary safety and efficacy of three doses of budiodarone in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Budiodarone is a chemical analogue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and shares its mixed ion channel electrophysiological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has a shorter half-life than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and a previously implanted dual-chamber pacemaker capable of storing electrograms for at least 4 weeks were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker memories were used to quantify atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> burden (AT/AFB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> antiarrhythmic drugs were stopped for greater than five half-lives and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> greater than 3 months prior to enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following a 4-week baseline period to assess AT/AFB off antiarrhythmic drugs, patients with AT/AFB between 3% and 70% were blindly randomized to placebo, 200, 400, or 600 mg BID of budiodarone for 12 weeks followed by a 4-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pacemakers were interrogated and safety assessed every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker-derived electrograms were adjudicated blinded to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary study endpoint was percent change from baseline AT/AFB over 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 72 randomized patients, 61 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median reduction of AT/AFB for the 400 and 600 mg BID groups vs. placebo was 54% and 74% (p = 0.01 and 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The budiodarone dose-response was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Number and duration of AT/AF episodes were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, budiodarone at both higher doses significantly reduced AT/AFB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The study is novel because dual-chamber pacemakers, previously placed for standard clinical indications, were successfully used to monitor AT/AFB </plain></SENT>
