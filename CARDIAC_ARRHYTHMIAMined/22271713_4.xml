<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We systematically reviewed the available evidence on the impact of CW compared with DW on periprocedural complications of AF catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched major Web databases for studies on radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF under CW versus DW with periprocedural bridging with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on periprocedural complications were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 9 studies (1 large case series indirectly compared with the latest Worldwide Survey) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 27,402 patients were included in the analysis (6400 undergoing ablation with CW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CW was associated with a striking decrease of thromboembolic complications (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.23; P&lt;0.001) and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.71; P=0.002) compared with DW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CW also did not increase the risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.31-1.43; P=0.30), including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.19-2.47; P=0.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is highly consistent evidence from observational studies that a CW strategy during radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications without increasing the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
