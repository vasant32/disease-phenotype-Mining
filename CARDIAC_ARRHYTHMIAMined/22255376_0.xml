<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Models can generate novel predictions, suggest experiments, and provide a quantitative understanding of underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limitations of present modeling approaches, however, include non-uniqueness of both parameters and the models themselves, and difficulties in accounting for experimental variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe new approaches that can begin to address these limitations, and show how these can provide novel insight into mathematical models of cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
