<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) is largely mediated by the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system through its modulating influence on the heart beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose a robust algorithm for quantifying instantaneous RSA as applied to heart beat intervals and respiratory recordings under dynamic breathing patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood volume pressure-derived heart beat series (pulse intervals, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi>) are modeled as an inverse Gaussian point process, with the instantaneous mean PI modeled as a bivariate regression incorporating both past <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> and respiration values observed at the beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A point process maximum likelihood algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters, and instantaneous RSA is estimated via a frequency domain transfer function evaluated at instantaneous respiratory frequency where high coherence between respiration and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53232">PIs</z:chebi> is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model is statistically validated using Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit analysis, as well as independence tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The algorithm is applied to subjects engaged in meditative practice, with distinctive dynamics in the respiration patterns elicited as a result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presented analysis confirms the ability of the algorithm to track important changes in cardiorespiratory interactions elicited during meditation, otherwise not evidenced in control resting states, reporting statistically significant increase in RSA gain as measured by our paradigm </plain></SENT>
