<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The prevalence, clinical significance, and pathogenesis of J-waves were studied in the patients with an ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two consecutive patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-elevation MI were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 68.6 ± 13.5 years, and 78.3% of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following successful PCI, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were monitored, and J-waves were measured 1 week after the MI and analysed in relation to the location of the MI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and ECG parameters were compared between the groups with and without J-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate dependency of the J-wave amplitude was analysed in the conducted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature beats</z:e> (APBs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>J-waves were present in 60.5% (≥0.1 mV) or 48.9% (≥0.2 mV) of the 152 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The J-waves were more often located in the inferior leads and more frequently in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340305" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="imi">inferior MI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of J-waves was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The J-wave amplitude increased in the conducted APB, mechanistically suggesting a phase 3 block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many patients in the early recovery phase after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI had J-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This ECG phenomenon was associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-dependent augmentation of the J-wave amplitude suggested a mechanistic role of conduction delay </plain></SENT>
