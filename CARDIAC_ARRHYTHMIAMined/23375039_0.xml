<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 48 male Japanese white big-ear rabbits were randomly divided into control group (A), I/R group (B), low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group (C), high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> group (D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration of and also reduced the concentration of plasma serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK), CK-MB, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ultra-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> skin peroxidase (GSH-PX), nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and endothelin (ET) were measured 1 h later after I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after I/R the hearts were harvested for pathological and ultrastructural analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma concentration of CK, CK-MB, hsCRP, NO, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and ET were decreased in C, D group compared with group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration of T-SOD and GSH-Px were increased significantly in C, D group compared with group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with group B, pathological and ultrastructural changes in C and D group were slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> area between group C, D and group B (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> area and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rate were lower in group C, D compare with group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">Rosiglitazone</z:chebi> may protect myocardium from I/R injury by enhancing T-SOD and GSH-Px concentration, inhibit inflammatory reaction, and improve endothelial function </plain></SENT>
