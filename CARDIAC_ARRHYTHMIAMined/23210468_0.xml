<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Objectives: The study objective was to determine whether Reiki practice increases the electromagnetic field strength from the heart and hands of Reiki practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rationale: This study repeated experiments performed 20 years ago that detected exceptionally high-strength electromagnetic fields (100 nT) from the hands of several energy healers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The equipment used was far more sensitive than in the original studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design: Using a Magnes 2500 WH SQUID, the electromagnetic field from the hands and heart of each of 3 Reiki masters was measured when they were (1) not practicing Reiki, (2) sending Reiki to a distant person, and (3) sending Reiki to a person in the room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar measurements were made on 4 Reiki-naïve volunteers before and after they received a Reiki training/attunement enabling them to self-administer Reiki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Setting/location: The study setting was the Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures: Magnetic field intensity of hands and heart recorded over 5-minute sessions with corresponding frequency spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions, sensors closest to the heart and the hands produced spikes of 2 pT corresponding to the heartbeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recordings from 2 Masters and 1 volunteer showed a low-intensity sine wave oscillation of 0.25-0.3 Hz (intensity 0.1-0.5 pT) whether or not they were practicing Reiki </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This oscillation probably reflected respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, judged by comparison with recent previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These signals were not detected in the original studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the current study, no electromagnetic field intensities greater than 3 pT were observed in any of the recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Practicing Reiki does not appear to routinely produce high-intensity electromagnetic fields from the heart or hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it is possible that energy healing is stimulated by tuning into an external environmental radiation, such as the Schumann resonance, which was blocked in the present study by the strong magnetic shielding surrounding the SQUID </plain></SENT>
