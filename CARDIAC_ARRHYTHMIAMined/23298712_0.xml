<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in atrial myocytes changes substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 'remodeled' intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis plays an important role in the development of the contractile dysfunction and the changes in atrial electrophysiology (contractile and electrical remodeling) that are characteristic of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies also show that unstable intracellular Ca(2+) signaling (i.e. increased Ca(2+) sparks and Ca(2+) waves) is present in atrial myocytes from AF patients and that it might contribute to cellular arrhythmogenic mechanisms that help maintain the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is currently not well understood how and when unstable Ca(2+) signaling develops during the progression of AF, or if, in cases of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, it even precedes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current work therefore in particular aims to elucidate the molecular and sub-cellular mechanisms underlying the arrhythmogenic intracellular Ca(2+) signaling instability in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As treatment of AF remains difficult, the identification of novel targets for counteracting or preventing arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) signaling is an important part of AF research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to recognize which phase of AF is addressed in a specific research (and ultimately treatment) approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we review and critique the distinct alterations in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling during the progression of AF from initial intracellular Ca(2+) overload to the remodeling process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We address Ca(2+) signaling after cardioversion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and its potential role in the recurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that altered Ca(2+) signaling during AF progression consists of three phases 1.) Ca(2+) Overload, 2.) Remodeling, and 3.) Steady State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, after AF termination three distinct phases of 'recovery' of intracellular Ca(2+) handling occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4.) Calcium Unloading, 5.) Reverse Remodeling and 6.) Full Recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While there is evidence that unstable Ca(2+) signaling is part of phases 1, 3 and 4, phase 2 (remodeling) appears to have a more stabilizing function on Ca(2+) signaling ('Ca(2+) silencing') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This has important implications for the timing and type of pharmacological intervention, especially for new compounds aimed at intracellular 'Ca(2+) stabilization' </plain></SENT>
