<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle-related diseases are well-known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and induce imbalances in autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether pet ownership modulates cardiac autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity imbalance in patients with lifestyle-related diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 191 patients (mean age 69 Â± 8 years) were interviewed about their pet ownership status and were classified into pet owner and nonowner groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After recording a 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram for heart rate variability analysis, frequency-domain and nonlinear-domain analyses were performed to determine the high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components, LF/HF ratio, and entropy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heart rate variability parameters were assessed for 24 hours, during the day (8.00 A.M. to 5.00 P.M.), and during the night (0:00 A.M. to 6.00 A.M.), and compared between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the potential predictive factors for cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e>, univariate and multivariate analyses of HF and LF/HF were conducted for potential confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pet owner group exhibited significantly greater HF(24h), HF(day), HF(night), entropy(24h), entropy(day), and entropy(night) and significantly lower LF/HF(24h) and LF/HF(night) compared to the nonowner group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, pet ownership was independently and positively associated with HF(24h,) HF(day), and HF(night) and inversely associated with LF/HF(24h) and LF/HF(night) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that pet ownership is an independent modulator of cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> in patients with lifestyle-related diseases </plain></SENT>
