<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that electrical cardioversion (EC) would be more effective and safer in converting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF to sinus rhythm, compared with intravenous propafenone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the emergency department (ED) of Valduce Hospital, a single-centre randomised trial was conducted to compare EC with pharmacological cardioversion (PC) to restore the sinus rhythm in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 247 patients was enrolled (121 in the EC group and 126 in the PC group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EC was more successful than PC in restoring sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful cardioversion was achieved in 108 out of 121 patients in the EC group (89.3%) and 93 out of 126 patients in the PC group (73.8%) (HR in the EC group, 0.34; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time patients spent in the ED undergoing treatment was significantly lower in the EC group compared with the PC group (median (range), 180 (120-900) vs 420 (120-1400) min; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EC was more effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF and resulted in a shorter length of stay in the ED than PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were small in number and transient in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials registration number NCT00933634 </plain></SENT>
