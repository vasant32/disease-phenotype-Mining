<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 27 is related to the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical relationship between HSP27 and AF is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to determine the clinical relationship between HSP27 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A case-control study was conducted (AF, n=114; control, n=100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum HSP27 (HSP27S) levels were measured by ELISA, and its correlations with electrophysiological characteristics and catheter ablation outcomes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with AF had a larger left atrial diameter (LAD), waist circumference, and body mass index, and a lower baseline HSP27S level, than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After logistic multivariate analysis, low baseline HSP27S was independently associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with AF, those with paroxysmal AF (PAF) had higher baseline HSP27S levels compared with those without PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with PAF, lower baseline HSP27S was associated with larger LAD, whereas baseline HSP27S was not correlated with LAD in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In PAF, low baseline HSP27S (≤3.85 ng/mL) was associated with low atrial voltage and nonpulmonary vein ectopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In non-PAF, the mean fractionated interval had a good correlation with baseline HSP27S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After catheter ablation, a high baseline HSP27S level could predict sinus rhythm maintenance in the patients with PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline HSP27S was also correlated with interleukin 10 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analysis of buffy coat <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels showed the same correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The HSP27S levels were correlated with LAD, left atrial voltage, and fractionated intervals, and predicted AF recurrence after catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms could be related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
