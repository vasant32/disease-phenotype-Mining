<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms that link mechanical and electrical dysfunction remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggest that ventricular electrical remodeling (VER) is a process that can be induced by altered mechanical stress, creating persistent electrophysiological changes that predispose the heart to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While VER is clearly a physiological property of the human heart, as evidenced by "T wave memory", it is also thought to occur in a variety of pathological states associated with altered ventricular activation such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and cardiac pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animal models that are currently being used for investigating stretch-induced VER have significant limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The zebrafish has recently emerged as an attractive animal model for studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and could overcome some of these limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Owing to its extensively sequenced genome, high conservation of gene function, and the comprehensive genetic resources that are available in this model, the zebrafish may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive detrimental electrical remodeling in response to stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we have established a zebrafish model to study mechano-electrical feedback in the heart, which combines efficient genetic manipulation with high-precision stretch and high-resolution electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this model, only 90 min of ventricular stretch caused VER and recapitulated key features of VER found previously in the mammalian heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the zebrafish model is a powerful platform for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying mechano-electrical feedback and VER in the heart </plain></SENT>
