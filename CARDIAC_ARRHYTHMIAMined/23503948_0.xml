<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a cardiovascular risk-screening program in students from grades 9-12 in 7 high schools in Hillsborough County, FL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained blood pressure (BP) measurements and calculated body mass index (BMI) as risk factors for future cardiovascular events as well as obtained an electrocardiogram (ECG) for the purposes of detecting possible life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of ~14,000 students contacted, 600 (4 %) participated in the screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 517 (86 %) were diagnosed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 71 (12 %) with borderline, and 12 (1 %) with <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECGs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although no participant had any cardiac history, two of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECGs</z:mp> indicated a cardiac diagnosis associated with the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both systolic and diastolic BP increased as the ECG diagnosis moved from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (115.6/73.8) through borderline (121.0/75.9) to an abnormal (125.0/80.7) diagnosis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P ≤ .0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in BMI was only observed when an ECG diagnosis was abnormal (P = .0180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Boys had a greater prevalence (18.97 %) of borderline or <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECGs</z:mp> compared with girls (6.75 %), whereas no discernible differences were seen in ECG diagnosis between white and nonwhite individuals (15.09 and 12.26 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although participation rates were low, a high school-based cardiovascular risk-screening program including ECG is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although ECG diagnosis tended to be related to other known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (BP, BMI), the utility of an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> in adolescence as a predictor of future cardiovascular risk will require further evaluation in more controlled settings </plain></SENT>
