<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For proper action according to current guidelines, the systematic evaluation of symptoms related to the underlying valve disease is of utmost importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If a discrepancy between symptoms reported or not reported by the patients and the severity of the valve disease is supposed, true absence of symptoms and exercise tolerance should be verified by spiroergometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the truly asymptomatic patient with a severe valvular lesion, preservation of myocardial adaption to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> volume or pressure overload should be tested utilizing appropriate imaging techniques like radionuclide ventriculography under exercise conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proper evaluation of the functional status is of growing importance in our aging population with its sedentary lifestyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this context, the results of a survey should be kept in mind, which indicated that a significant proportion of patients still have interventions too late during the natural history of their valve disease with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> persisting after a primarily successful valve repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
