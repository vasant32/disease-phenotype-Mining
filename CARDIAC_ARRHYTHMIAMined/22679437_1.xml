<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the unclear etiologies of AF and a potential role of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, the present study examined cardiac reactive oxygen species production and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase (NOX) expression in AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Patients with AF were older than those without (58.8 ± 11.7 vs. 47.8 ± 19.2, p = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas total [Formula: see text] production (determined by electron spin resonance) was similar in patients with and without AF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production was more than doubled in AF patients (149.8 ± 26.28 vs. 66.9 ± 7.14 pmol/mg/min, p = 0.0055), which correlated well with a doubling in NOX isoform 4 (NOX4) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF patients with co-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> had three-fold higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production compared to those without (239.0 ± 125.1 vs. 83.6 ± 51.3 pmol/mg/min, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 atrial cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, a known modulator of atrial structural remodeling, resulted in upregulation of NOX4 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> production, further implicating a potential role of NOX4 in atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Our data represent the first implication that NOX4-derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> may play an important role in the etiologies of AF </plain></SENT>
