<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with 1 episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with intermittent wide QRS regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> without hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> with cardioversion to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, wide QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW syndrome</z:e> with antidromic conduction of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through the accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW syndrome</z:e> as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events </plain></SENT>
