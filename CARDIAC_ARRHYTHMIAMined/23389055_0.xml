<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relations of PR interval with indices of vascular function and endothelial repair as the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study comprised 348 high-risk patients with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> recruited from medical outpatient clinics and 150 healthy subjects without such a history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PR interval was considered prolonged if &gt;200 ms, as determined from resting 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular function was assessed by brachial flow-meditated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) using high-resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating CD133(+)/KDR(+) endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among healthy subjects, PR interval was inversely associated with FMD (R = -0.20, P = 0.015), but not with the level of circulating CD133(+)/KDR(+) EPC (R = 0.05, P = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among high-risk cardiovascular patients, PR prolongation &gt;200 ms was more common compared with healthy subjects (45/348 (13 %) versus 4/150 (3 %), P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PR interval was associated inversely with FMD (R = -0.14, P = 0.01) and positively with circulating CD133(+)/KDR(+) EPC level (R = +0.14, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Circulating CD133(+)/KDR(+) EPC level was significantly increased in patients with PR prolongation &gt;200 ms (0.87 ± 0.37 versus 0.68 ± 0.42 (log, ×10(-3)/ml), P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for potential confounders, increased PR interval remained independently associated with increased CD133(+)/KDR(+) EPC by +0.002 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.000 to 0.004 (log, ×10(-3)/ml), P = 0.011) and depressed FMD (B = -0.014 %, 95 % CI -0.027 to -0.002, P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PR prolongation is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and evidence of endothelial repair activation in patients with high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
