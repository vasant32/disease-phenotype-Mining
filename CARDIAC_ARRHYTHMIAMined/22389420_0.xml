<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It aims at reducing the bulk created by two or three pins at the proximal end of the defibrillator lead and its corresponding ports at the header of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Having only one connection port between the lead and the device reduces the material in the pocket, the risk of lead-to-port mismatch, may lower the risk of lead <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e>, and probably makes the implantation procedure a little easier since only one set screw is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these conceived benefits are related to convenience rather than to a medical need </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the recent experiences with the possible negative clinical impact of 'minor' changes like simply downsizing a defibrillator lead, a word of caution is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lead is the weakest part of the defibrillator system, complex in design and undergoing constant stress through movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is very hard to predict which issues may evolve over time with the changes in lead design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>Does the perceived benefit really outweigh an unpredictable risk in a sensitive medical product like a defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This article tries to address the possible issues of the new spring contacts instead of set screws, the proximity of the low- and high-voltage connections as well as the inability of adding a pace/sense or an additional shock lead without a special adaptor, and advocates a measured speed in the introduction of this technology </plain></SENT>
