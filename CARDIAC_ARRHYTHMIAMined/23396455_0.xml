<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although âˆ¼22% of the astronaut corps are women, most mechanistic studies use mostly male subjects, despite known sex differences in autonomic control and postflight orthostatic intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied adrenergic, baroreflex, and autonomic indexes during continuous infusions of vasoactive drugs in men and women during a 60-day head-down bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volunteers were tested before bed rest (20 men and 10 women) and around day 30 (20 men and 10 women) and day 60 (16 men and 8 women) of bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three increasing doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (PE) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> were infused for 10 min after an infusion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 20-min rest period separated the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autonomic activity was approximated by spectral indexes of heart rate and blood pressure variability, and baroreflex sensitivity was measured by the spontaneous baroreflex slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parasympathetic modulation and baroreflex sensitivity decreased with bed rest, with women experiencing a larger decrease in baroreflex sensitivity by day 30 than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sympathetic activation of men and parasympathetic responsiveness of women in blood pressure control during physiological stress were preserved throughout bed rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During PE infusions, women experienced saturation of the R-R interval at high frequency, whereas men did not, revealing a sex difference in the parabolic relationship between high-frequency R-R interval, a measurement of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and R-R interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These sex differences in blood pressure control during simulated microgravity reveal the need to study sex differences in long-duration spaceflight to ensure the health and safety of the entire astronaut corps </plain></SENT>
