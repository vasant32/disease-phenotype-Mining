<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guided by the polyvagal perspective, we tested whether children's VRC is associated with attenuated sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (SNS) stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one 4- to 5-year-old children living in poverty underwent two standardized laboratory stress induction procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac vagal reactivity (respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) to a first set of stressors (social, cognitive, physical, and emotional) indexed VRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a second set of stressors, participants were randomly assigned to a supportive or nonsupportive social context, and cardiac sympathetic reactivity (preejection period) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized VRC would predict lower SNS stress reactivity, but only in the socially supportive context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with high VRC showed attenuated SNS stress reactivity in the socially supportive context compared to children with high VRC in the nonsupportive context and children with low VRC in either context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual differences in VRC predict attenuated SNS stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Understanding how social support and VRC jointly mitigate SNS stress reactivity may further efforts to prevent negative health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories are discussed </plain></SENT>
