<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only studies using invasive coronary angiography as reference standard were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk of bias was assessed (QUADAS-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were stratified according to patient group on the basis of clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of DSC CT for detecting 50% or greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> were calculated by using a bivariate summary receiver operating characteristic or random-effects model.Results:Twenty-five studies reported accuracy of DSC CT for diagnosing CAD in difficult to image patients; in 22 studies, one of two CT units of the same manufacturer (Somatom Definition or Somatom Definition Flash) was used, and in the remaining three, a different CT unit of another manufacturer (Aquilion One) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled, per-patient estimates of sensitivity were 97.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.0%, 99.9%) and 97.7% (95% CI: 93.2%, 99.3%) for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and high heart rates, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding pooled estimates of specificity were 81.7% (95% CI: 71.6%, 89.4%) and 86.3% (95% CI: 80.2%, 90.7%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were acquired by using Somatom Definition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two studies with Somatom and one study with Aquilion One, sensitivity estimates of 90% or greater were reported in patients with previous stent implantations; specificities were 81.7% and 89.5% for Somatom and 81.0% for Aquilion One </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with high coronary calcium scores, previous bypass grafts, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, only per-segment or per-artery data were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity estimates remained high (&gt;90% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one study), and specificities ranged from 79.1% to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were acquired by using Somatom Definition.Conclusion:DSC CT may be sufficiently accurate to diagnose clinically significant CAD in some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> difficult to image patients.Â© RSNA, 2013Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13121136/-/DC1 </plain></SENT>
