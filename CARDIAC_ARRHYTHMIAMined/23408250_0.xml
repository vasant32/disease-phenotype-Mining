<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its recent popularity as a recreational drug in the United States has led to numerous reports to poison control centers across the country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As with other synthetic cathinones, the recreational use of MDPV has resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MDPV is thought to exert its pharmacologic effects by inhibiting the reuptake of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report describes the case of an exposure of a 39-year-old male to MDPV, which resulted in his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmortem concentrations of MDPV in various tissues were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The detection of MDPV in tissues and fluids was accomplished using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after solid-phase extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood analysis also demonstrated therapeutic levels of lamotrigine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8871">risperidone</z:chebi>, benztropine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51209">pseudoephedrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection of cathinones in hair was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after solid-phase extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MDPV was uniformly distributed among multiple tissues (blood, brain, muscle, cerebrospinal fluid and lung) at concentrations of approximately 0.4 to 0.6 µg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tissue and fluids responsible for detoxification/excretion had higher concentrations of MDPV (kidney, liver and bile &gt; 0.8 µg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A blood concentration ≥ 0.4 µg/mL was judged sufficient to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was ruled MDPV intoxication resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
