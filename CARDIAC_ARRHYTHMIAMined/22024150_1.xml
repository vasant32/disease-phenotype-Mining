<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), together with its KCNE Î² subunits, plays a pivotal role both in the repolarization of cardiac tissue and in water and salt transport across epithelial membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nedd4/Nedd4-like (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4) ubiquitin-protein ligases interact with the KCNQ1 <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel through a PY motif located in the C terminus of KCNQ1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This interaction induces ubiquitylation of KCNQ1, resulting in a reduced surface density of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was reported recently that the epithelial <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel is regulated by the reverse process-deubiquitylation-mediated by USP2 (ubiquitin-specific protease 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this article, we investigated whether deubiquitylation may regulate KCNQ1 channel complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we used electrophysiology, biochemistry, and confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electrophysiological investigations of KCNQ1/KCNE1 proteins coexpressed with USP2-45 or USP2-69 isoforms and Nedd4-2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and mammalian cells revealed that both USP2 isoforms counter the Nedd4-2-specific downregulation of I(Ks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies showed that the total and surface-expressed KCNQ1 protein was more abundant when coexpressed with USP2 and Nedd4-2 as compared with Nedd4-2 alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blotting revealed partial protection against covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties on KCNQ1 when USP2 was coexpressed with Nedd4-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coimmunoprecipitation assays suggested that USP2 can bind to KCNQ1 independently of the PY motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry confirmed that USP2 restores the membrane localization of KCNQ1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that USP2 can be a potent regulator of KCNQ1 surface density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>USP2, which is well expressed in many tissues, may therefore be important in controlling the KCNQ1 channel dynamics in vivo </plain></SENT>
