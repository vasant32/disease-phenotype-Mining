<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp>) with aneurysmatic formation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011623'>muscular ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010420'>mVSD</z:mp>) with Amplatzer duct occluder II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 48 cases received transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> aneurysmatic formation or <z:mp ids='MP_0010420'>mVSD</z:mp> from February 2011 to March 2012 in our hospital (42 <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> with aneurysmatic formation and 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0010420'>mVSD</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 5.2 years (range: 1.8 - 15 years), and median weight was 20.2 kg (range: 12 - 44 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amplatzer duct occluder II was selected depending on the condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The device was implanted by antegrade or retrograde approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications such as residual shunt, valvular regurgitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were evaluated by echocardiography or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 9.5 months (range: 1 - 13 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ratio of pulmonary (Qp) to systemic (Qs) blood flow was 1.35 ± 0.15 before transcatheter closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diameter of exit hole of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> was (2.46 ± 0.53) mm measured by transthoracic echocardiography, and (2.35 ± 0.40) mm by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Successful implantation of the device was achieved in 46 patients (96%) and unsuccessful in two cases due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (92%) patients were closed successfully, and trivial residual leak was evidenced in four patients and remained unchanged during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0010420'>mVSD</z:mp> still had trivial residual shunt at 6 months post procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New trivial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> was observed in 1 patient (2.1%) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed procedural related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011711'>left anterior fascicular block</z:hpo> and remained unchanged during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010420'>mVSD</z:mp> could be successfully treated with Amplatzer duct occluder II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the long waist and large disc of the device could interfere with tricuspid valve function and cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
