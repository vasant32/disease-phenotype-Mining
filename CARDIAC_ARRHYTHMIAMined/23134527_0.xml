<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in in vivo models is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine effects of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and delayed RIPC on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> protocol anesthetized open chest rats were exposed to 5 minutes of proximal left coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) and 10 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were either untreated (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion, IR group, n = 17) or received RIPC (n = 14) with 5 minutes bilateral femoral occlusions followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion times 3, started 30 minutes before CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At reperfusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) was delayed in RIPC group (25.7 seconds) versus IR (8.8 seconds; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Number of episodes of VT was 17.0 in IR versus 3.0 in the RIPC group (P = 0.01) and duration of VT was 54.1 seconds in IR versus 4.9 seconds in RIPC (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Number of ventricular premature complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>) was 26.0 in IR and 10.0 in RIPC rats (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of reperfusion injury salvage kinases (RISK), that is, phospho-Akt and phospho-p70S6 in the risk area of IR and RIPC hearts were similarly higher compared to the nonischemic areas both at 1 and 10 minutes into reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delayed RIPC was induced on day 1 and on day 2, myocardial IR was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed RIPC did not affect VT or <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> RIPC of the lower limbs induced a powerful delay in/and reduction in IR induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but without evoking the RISK pathway; a late protective phase of RIPC on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> did not occur </plain></SENT>
