<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kernel independent component analysis (KICA) was used to extract nonlinear features and wavelet transform (WT) was used to extract time-frequency features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combining these features could include more information about the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed the classification model based on SVM combined with error correcting output codes (ECOC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) value were used to assess the classification model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of AUC is 0.956 against <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
