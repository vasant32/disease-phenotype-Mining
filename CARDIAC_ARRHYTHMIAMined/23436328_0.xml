<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in action potential recordings from healthy intact hearts remains highly variable, and, where present, is almost entirely abolished at fast pacing rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the functional importance of intrinsic action potential duration (APD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in healthy ventricles, and particularly its role during rapidly activating reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By incorporating both transmural and apicobasal APD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within a biventricular rabbit computational model and comparing with an equivalent homogeneous model, we directly investigated the functional importance of intrinsic APD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> under fast pacing and arrhythmogenic protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although differences in APD were significantly modulated at the tissue level during pacing, and further reduced as pacing frequency increased, small differences were still noticeable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such differences were further marginally accentuated/ attenuated via electrotonic effects relative to wavefront propagation directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remaining small levels of APD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> under the fastest pacing frequencies resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> initiation via <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> conduction block, in contrast to complete block in the homogeneous model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such induction mechanisms were more evident during premature stimuli at slower paced rhythms where intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> remained to a greater degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, however, intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> made little difference to overall reentrant behaviour, either visually, or in terms of duration, metrics quantifying filament/phase singularity dynamics, and global electrocardiogram characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, despite being important during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> initiation, intrinsic electrophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> plays little functional role during rapid pacing and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> dynamics in the healthy ventricle, and, thus, questions the need to incorporate such detail in computational models when simulating rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
