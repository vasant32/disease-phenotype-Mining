<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e>), individuals feel compelled to repeatedly perform security-related behaviors, even though these behaviours seem excessive and unwarranted to them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present research investigated two alternative ways of explaining such behavior: (1) a dysfunction of activation--a starting problem--in which the level of excitation in response to stimuli suggesting potential danger is abnormally strong; versus (2) a dysfunction of termination--a stopping problem--in which the satiety-like process for shutting down security-related thoughts and actions is abnormally weak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In two experiments, 70 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> (57 with washing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600104" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">compulsions</z:e>, 13 with checking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600104" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">compulsions</z:e>) and 72 controls were exposed to contamination cues--immersing a hand in wet diapers--and later allowed to wash their hands, first limited to 30 s and then for as long as desired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intensity of activation of security motivation was measured objectively by change in respiratory sinus arrythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjective ratings (e.g., contamination) and behavioral measures (e.g., duration of hand washing) were also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> patients with washing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600104" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">compulsions</z:e> did not differ significantly in their levels of initial activation to the threat of contamination; however, they were significantly less able to reduce this activation by engaging in the corrective behavior of hand-washing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the deactivating effect of hand-washing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> patients with checking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600104" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">compulsions</z:e> was similar to that for controls, indicating that the dysfunction of termination in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> is specific to the patient's symptom profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> is characterized by a reduced ability of security-related behavior to terminate motivation evoked by potential danger, rather than a heightened initial sensitivity to potential threat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They lend support to the security-motivation theory of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> (Szechtman &amp; Woody, 2004) and have important implications both for research into the biological mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> and for the development of new treatment approaches </plain></SENT>
