<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Naturally occurring mutations in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) have been associated with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is clear that delayed afterdepolarization resulting from abnormal activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release is the primary cause of RyR2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying RyR2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> is completely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigate the role of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal region of RyR2 in and the impact of a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-associated RyR2 mutations on the termination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The 35-residue exon-3 region of RyR2 is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single-cell <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> imaging revealed that the deletion of the first 305 NH2-terminal residues encompassing exon-3 or the deletion of exon-3 itself markedly reduced the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> threshold at which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release terminates and increased the fractional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single-cell cytosolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> imaging also showed that both RyR2 deletions enhanced the amplitude of store overload-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transients in HEK293 cells or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the RyR2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal mutations, A77V, R176Q/T2504M, R420W, and L433P, which are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular displasia type 2, also reduced the threshold for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release termination and increased fractional release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RyR2 A1107M mutation associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> had the opposite action (i.e., increased the threshold for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release termination and reduced fractional release) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal region of RyR2 is an important determinant of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release termination, and that abnormal fractional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release attributable to aberrant termination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release is a common defect in RyR2-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
