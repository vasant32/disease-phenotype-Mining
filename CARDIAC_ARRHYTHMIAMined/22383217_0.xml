<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic nerve sprouting in healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) has been associated with high incidences of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to test that sympathetic hyperinnervation and/or MI remodels the myocardial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> signaling and ultimately increases the severity of ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myocardial necrotic injury (MNI) was created by liquid nitrogen freeze-thawing across an intact diaphragm to mimic MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac sympathetic hyperinnervation was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> subcutaneous injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17254">4-methylcatechol</z:chebi>, a potent stimulator of nerve growth factor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that sympathetic hyperinnervation with or without MNI upregulated the myocardial expression of ionotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors (iGluRs), including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor (NMDAR) and AMPA receptor (AMPAR), and induced cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (12 mg/kg) or AMPA (15 mg/kg) triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in rats with healed MNI plus sympathetic hyperinnervation; these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were prevented by respective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of NMDAR or AMPAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that MNI with sympathetic nerve sprouting upregulates the expression of NMDAR and AMPAR in the myocardium and this impact in turn enhances cardiac responses to stimulations of iGluRs and thus increases the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
