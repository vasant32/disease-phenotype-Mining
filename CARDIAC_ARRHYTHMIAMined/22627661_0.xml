<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Management strategy of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (TOF)-including timing, as well as surgical technique-remains a controversial topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to analyse both early and late results of our consistent policy of non-neonatal transatrial/transpulmonary (TA/TP) repair of TOF over almost 14 years, in order to assess preservation or possible deterioration of right ventricular (RV) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 245 consecutive patients with TOF, referred to our group for repair between September 1997 and December 2010, have been prospectively followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their clinical and echocardiographic data were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent complete TA/TP repair at a median age of 1.6 years (range 0.2 to 55.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up (median 8.5 years, range 0.5 to 14.6 years) was 100% completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were three early re-operations: one for residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (<z:mp ids='MP_0010449'>RVOTO</z:mp>), one for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and one for remote second <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three non-cardiac-related late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 14 years was 98.8% (242/245) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty five patients required late re-operation, including 23 patients (9.4%, 23/245) who had pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients remained asymptomatic at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean residual right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) pressure gradients have remained stable (6.8 ± 6.6 mmHg, 95% CI 5.9-7.6, early postoperatively, versus 7.6 ± 7.5 mmHg, 95% CI 6.6-8.6 at follow-up; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean qualitative grade of <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary valve insufficiency</z:mp> (PVI) increased (from 1.4 ± 0.9, 95% CI 1.3-1.5 at discharge to 2.1 ± 1.2, 95% CI 2-2.3 at follow-up; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mean qualitative grade of <z:mp ids='MP_0006044'>tricuspid valve insufficiency</z:mp> (TVI) also increased (from 1 ± 0.7, 95% CI 0.9-1 at discharge to 1.5 ± 0.8, 95% CI 1.4-1.6 at follow-up; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, RV function has remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> have been noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our management strategy of non-neonatal TA/TP repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with TOF is associated with minimal early and late mortality and morbidity, relatively low re-operation rate, preserved RV function and excellent clinical outcomes at follow-up over almost 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Since many patients demonstrated progressive increase in PVI and TVI, a much longer follow-up is necessary to determine the ultimate rates of late re-operation for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) </plain></SENT>
