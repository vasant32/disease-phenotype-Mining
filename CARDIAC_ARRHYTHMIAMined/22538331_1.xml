<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is sometimes challenging to diagnose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because extraction is associated with significant morbidity/mortality, new imaging modalities to confirm the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and its dissemination would be of clinical value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group A, 42 patients with suspected CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive PET/CT was defined as abnormal uptake along cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B included 12 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> who underwent PET/CT 4 to 8 weeks post-implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group C included 12 patients implanted for &gt;6 months without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> who underwent PET/CT for another indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative ratio (SQR) was obtained from the ratio between maximal uptake and lung parenchyma uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Group A, 32 of 42 patients with suspected CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had positive PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with positive PET/CT underwent extraction with excellent correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients with positive PET/CT, 6 were treated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282002" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superficial infection</z:e> with clinical resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient with positive PET/CT but negative leukocyte scan was considered false positive due to Dacron pouch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with negative-PET/CT were treated with antibiotics and none has relapsed at 12.9 Â± 1.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Group B, patients had mild uptake seen at the level of the connector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no abnormal uptake in Group C patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Median SQR was significantly higher in Group A (A = 2.02 vs. B = 1.08 vs. C = 0.57; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT is useful in differentiating between CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and recent post-implant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It may guide appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
