<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the haemodynamic effects of different pHRs (60 or 80 b.p.m.), using an implanted haemodynamic monitor (IHM), during a 2-week period in ambulatory CRT patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten CRT patients received an IHM (Chronicle(®), Medtronic Inc.) to continuously record right ventricular systolic (RVSP) and diastolic (RVDP) pressure, as well as estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (ePAD) during a 2-week period at two basic pHR programming (60 and 80 b.p.m.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output (CO) was calculated using a validated IHM algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of each period, 6 min walk test (6MWT), quality of life (QoL), and plasma levels of brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing at 80 b.p.m. significantly reduced the 2-week average of ePAD compared with 60 b.p.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(23.4 ± 6.2 vs. 25.1 ± 6.5 mmHg, P = 0.03), whereas CO was increased (4.5 ± 1.3 vs. 4.2 ± 1.4 L/min; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly ePAD, RVSP, and RVDP were significantly lower with a pHR of 80 b.p.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 6MWT, QoL score, and BNP were not affected by the pHR.CONCLUSION: In CRT patients, a basic pHR of 80 b.p.m. compared with 60 b.p.m. reduces filling pressures and increases CO during a 2-week period of ambulatory living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that increasing the basic pHR may be considered to achieve short-term haemodynamic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term effects of differential pHR programming remain to be established </plain></SENT>
