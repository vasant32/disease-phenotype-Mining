<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The Mediterranean diet (MedD) has long been associated with lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available on association between MedD, vitamins intake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the relationship between adherence to MedD, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> intake and spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A group of 800 subjects was included in a case-control study; 400 of them had a first detected episode of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nutritional parameters were assessed by a self-administered food frequency validated questionnaire and completed by an interviewer-administered 7 days diet recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence to MedD was evaluated using the Mediterranean Score and intake of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> from food was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adherence to the Med Diet was lower in patients that developed AF compared to control (mean Med Score: 22.3 ± 3.1 vs 27.9 ± 5.6; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median value was 23.5 (Q1-Q3 range 23-30) in patients with AF and 27.4 (Q1-Q3 range 26-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated intake of total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> was lower in patients with AF (13.5 ± 8.3 vs 18.2 ± 9.4 mmol/d; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the highest quartile of Mediterranean Score had higher probability of spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR1.9; 95%CI 1.58-2.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High levels of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> intake were also associated with an increasing probability of spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (O.R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>1.8; 95%CI 1.56-2.99; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had lower adherence to MedD and lower <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> intake compared to control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> showing a higher Med Score had more probability of a spontaneous conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
