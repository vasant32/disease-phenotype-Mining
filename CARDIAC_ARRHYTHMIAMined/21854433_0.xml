<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the utility of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> administration to augment the chronotropic response of patients undergoing treadmill exercise stress echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective study, we assessed the utility of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> administration to augment the chronotropic response in 1,396 patients undergoing treadmill exercise stress echocardiography between January 2004 and January 2009, compared with a historical control group with no <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">Atropine</z:chebi> was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of abnormal studies differed significantly between patients who underwent exercise with and without <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> augmentation (15% vs. 10%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the historical control group, the proportion of patients who achieved â‰¥85% of their target heart rates increased from 67% to 78% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> augmentation is safe and feasible, further studies are required to determine whether it is an equivalent surrogate to achieving target heart rate through exercise alone </plain></SENT>
