<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence ranges from 40 to 50%, despite the attempts of electrical cardioversion and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this review, the literature data about predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence are highlighted, with special regard to clinical, therapeutic, biochemical, ECG and echocardiographic parameters after electrical cardioversion and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identifying predictors of success in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion or ablation may allow a better selection of patients to undergo these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim is to reduce healthcare costs and avoid exposing patients to unnecessary procedures and related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> depends on a combination of several parameters and each patient should be individually assessed for such a risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
