<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a case report of a young Gabonese lady who presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and we suspected a paripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent investigations showed isolated left ventricular noncompaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few months later, the same disease was disclosed at her 9 year-old son who presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suspect a family form of left ventricular noncompaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And it is the first description in subsaharan Africa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hereditary character of this new form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> linked to a genetic mutation on the X chromosome is well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This disease is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, high incidence of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The echocardiography and the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has been reported to be tools for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Africa, access to these techniques remains a privilege </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>So the discovery of illness is often late and the family screening are special </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our area, the therapeutic management is the medical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Implatable cardioverter defibrillator or heart transplantation are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So long-term prognosis of our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> stays poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With best equipment in our hospitals and good training of African cardiologists, we should improve the management of our patients </plain></SENT>
