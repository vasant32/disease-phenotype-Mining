<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The utility of defibrillation threshold testing in patients undergoing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher defibrillation thresholds have been noted in patients undergoing implantation of cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the risks and potential benefits of testing may be higher in this population, we sought to assess the impact of defibrillation safety margin or vulnerability safety margin testing in CRT-D recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 256 consecutive subjects who underwent CRT-D implantation between January 2003 and December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into two groups based on whether (n= 204) or not (n= 52) safety margin testing was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, tachyarrhythmia therapies, procedural results, and clinical outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) severity, were comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases of HF exacerbation (2%), including one leading to one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were recorded in the tested group immediately post-implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed in the untested group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 32 Â± 20 months, the proportion of appropriate shocks in the two groups was similar (31 vs. 25%, P = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were three cases of failed appropriate shocks in the tested group, despite adequate safety margins at implantation, whereas no failed shocks were noted in the untested group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survival was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Defibrillation efficacy testing during implant of CRT-D was associated with increased morbidity and did not predict the success of future device therapy or improve survival during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
