<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (E/e') correlates with left ventricular (LV) filling pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, an E/e' ratio more than 15 is an excellent predictor of increased LV filling pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the prognostic implications of preoperative estimated LV filling pressure, assessed by E/e' ratio, in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This observational study investigated 1,048 consecutive adults undergoing elective off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, cardiac dysfunction, or need for new revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression and survival analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An E/e' ratio more than 15 was independently associated with 30-day MACE (odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-3.9, P = 0.001) and 1-yr MACE (hazard ratio 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.1, P = 0.001), irrespective of underlying LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MACE free 1-yr survival rate was significantly decreased in patients with E/e' &gt;15, irrespective of underlying LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased LV filling pressure, assessed by E/e' ratio, is an independent predictor of 30-day and 1-yr MACE in patients who undergo elective off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that measurements of E/e' may assist in preoperative risk stratification of these patients </plain></SENT>
