<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular etiologies of AF are poorly understood, leaving patients with limited therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF has been recognized as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> in almost 30% of patient cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, few genetic loci have been identified and the mechanisms linking genetic variants to AF susceptibility remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By sequencing 193 probands with lone AF, we identified a Q76E variant within the coding sequence of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> gremlin-2 (GREM2) that increases its inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional modeling in zebrafish revealed that, through regulation of BMP signaling, GREM2 is required for cardiac laterality and atrial differentiation during embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GREM2 overactivity results in slower cardiac contraction rates in zebrafish, and induction of previously identified AF candidate genes encoding connexin-40, sarcolipin and atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By live heart imaging in zebrafish overexpressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or variant GREM2, we found abnormal contraction velocity specifically in atrial cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results implicate, for the first time, regulators of BMP signaling in human AF, providing mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and identifying potential new therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
