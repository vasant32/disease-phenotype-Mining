<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>Atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) is the one of most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> detected in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Along with remarkable development of device technology, the first treatment strategy of <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> has been transcatheter closure in feasible cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are only a few publications regarding the results of transcatheter closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in elderly patients, especially those over 60 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our results of transcatheter closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in patients over 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between May 2006 and December 2011, 31 patients over 60 years old (25 female and 6 male; mean 66.7Â±5.25 years old, range 61-78 years old) were referred to our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 23 patients underwent therapeutic catheterization to close <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp>, and the closure was successful in 22 patients (95.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent the procedure survived except for one patient who expired because of left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A small residual shunt was observed in two (9%) of 21 patients before discharge but disappeared at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients eventually had complete closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were five patients who had coronary problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using a stent at the same time as transcatheter closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected in 6 of 23 patients (26.1%) before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient was successfully treated by radiofrequency ablation before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No patients displayed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up echocardiographic evaluation showed a significantly improved right ventricular geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that transcatheter closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> is a safe and an effective treatment method for patients over 60 years old if the procedure is performed under a thorough evaluation of comorbidities and risk factors </plain></SENT>
