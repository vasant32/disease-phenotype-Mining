<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A system for unobtrusive night-time electrocardiogram (EKG) and heart rate variability (HRV) monitoring as well as data analysis methods are presented, comparing bed sheet HR and HRV values with corresponding parameters obtained by a reference measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our system uses eight embroidered textile electrodes attached laterally to a bed sheet for measuring bipolar contact EKG from multiple channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrodes are arranged in a line so that at least two adjacent electrodes make sufficient skin contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focus of the signal processing development has been on selecting the best measurement channel for further analysis and minimizing the amount of incorrectly detected R-peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The test measurements were performed with four healthy men without previously known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> and one who frequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (ectopic beats) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For healthy test subjects, an average of 94.9% heartbeat detection coverage was achieved with the system during 29 measurement nights (in total 213.8 h of data) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the quality of the signal obtained from bed sheet electrodes is good enough for the computer-assisted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Applications for EKG derived RR-interval data include the calculation of HRV parameters that can be utilized in sleep quality analysis and other wellness-related topics as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
