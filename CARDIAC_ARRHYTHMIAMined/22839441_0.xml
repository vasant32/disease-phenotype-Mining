<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To compare results of radiofrequency (RF) ablation (A) of mitral and inferior septal isthmuses in the left atrium for the treatment of perimitral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> previously subjected to RF isolation of pulmonary veins and modification of the left atrial anatomical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We treated 20 patients (3 women, mean age 57.1+/-9.3 years) with recurrent postablational perimitral AF verified by 3-dimensional reconstruction of left and right atrial activation by nonfluoroscopic mapping and pacing techniques of entrainment into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At first stage RFA was carried out in the region of mitral isthmus (its endocardial parts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At second stage RFA was performed in the region of coronary sinus (CS) roof (epicardial portions of the mitral isthmus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the third stage RFA influences were applied in the region of inferior septal isthmus (endocardial portions of the inferioseptal isthmus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the fourth stage RFA was applied in the region of roof of proximal CS (epicardial portions of inferioseptal isthmus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Application of RF influences to endocardial parts of the mitral isthmus resulted in sinus rhythm (SR) restoration in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Change of length of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle was noted in 5cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SR restoration was observed after RFA in the region of the roof of distal CS in 3 cases and change of length of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle was noted in 2 more cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RFA of epicardial parts of the inferioseptal isthmus resulted in SR restoration in 3 cases and in increase of atypical AF cycle length in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 12 cases SR was restored during RFA application in the region of the roof of proximal CS parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RF influences in the region of endocardial (stage 1) and epicardial (stage 2) parts of the mitral isthmus resulted in SR restoration in 9 cases while continuation of RFA in the region of endocardial (stage 3) and epicardial (stage 4) parts of the inferioseptal isthmus led to SR restoration in the remaining 15 cases (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFA of endocardial and epicardial parts of the inferioseptal isthmus significantly more often led to termination of perimitral atypical AF in patients previously operated because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
