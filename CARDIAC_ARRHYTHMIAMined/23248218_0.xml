<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined if AC and DC for minute-order long-term heart rate dynamics also have independent predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 24-hr Holter electrcardiograms in 708 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients who were followed up for up to 30 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acceleration capacity and DC was calculated with the time scales of T (window size defining heart rate) and s (wavelet scale) from 1 to 500 s and compared their prognostic values with conventional measures (AC(conv) and DC(conv)) that were calculated with (T,s) = [1,2 (beat)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 47 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both increased AC(conv) and decreased DC(conv) predicted mortality (C statistic, 0.792 and 0.797) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, sharp peaks of C statistics were observed at (T,s) = [2,7 (<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>)] for both increased AC and decreased DC (0.762 and 0.768), but there were larger peaks of C statistics at around [30,60 (<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>)] for both (0.783 and 0.796) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C statistic was greater for DC than AC at (30,60) (P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deceleration capacity at (30,60) was a significant predictor even after adjusted for AC(conv) (P = 0.020) and DC(conv) (P = 0.028), but the predictive power of AC at (30,60) was no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A decrease in DC for minute-order long-term heart rate dynamics is a strong predictor for post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> mortality and the predictive power is independent of AC(conv) and DC(conv) for beat-to-beat short-term heart rate dynamics </plain></SENT>
