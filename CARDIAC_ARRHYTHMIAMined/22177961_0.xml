<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using multiple epicardial electrodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was recorded in 22 isolated perfused rabbit hearts, analyzing the activation maps upon applying trains of stimuli at 3 different frequencies close to that of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>: a) at baseline; b) after radio-frequency ablation to induce a lesion of the left ventricular free wall (length=10 [1] mm), and c) after lengthening the lesion (length=23 [2] mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following lesion induction, the regularity of the recorded signals decreased and significant variations in the direction of the activation fronts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On lengthening the lesion, there was a slight increase in the episodes with at least 3 consecutive captures when pacing at cycles 10% longer than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (baseline: 0.6 [0.7]; initial lesion: 1 [1], no significant differences; lengthened lesion: 3 [2.8]; P&lt;.001), while a decrease was observed in those obtained upon pacing at cycles 10% shorter than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The radio-frequency -induced lesion increases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of myocardial activation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and modifies arrival of the activation fronts in the adjacent zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-frequency pacing during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> produces occasional captures during at least 3 consecutive stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lengthened lesion in turn slightly increases capture capacity when using cycles slightly longer than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
