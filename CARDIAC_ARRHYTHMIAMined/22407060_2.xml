<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most significant histological property of AF is atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, but the underlying mechanism is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the expression of miR-133 and miR-30, anti-fibrotic microRNAs (miRNAs), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF in canines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total amount of 42 mongrel canines of either gender, weighing between 20 and 28 kg, were randomly assigned to the sham-operated and AF groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> canines were subjected to weekly physical examinations and electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alterations in tissue structure were assessed in atrial tissue samples by using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and Masson's trichrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of miR-133 and miR-30 was determined by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blot analyses of atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed using the program SPSS 11.5 for Windows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, rapid pacing from the left superior pulmonary vein induced sustained AF in the AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the left atrium, increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and northern blot analyses showed that miR-133 and miR-30 expression was downregulated in the AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results show that both miR-133 and miR-30 play an important role in controlling structural changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
