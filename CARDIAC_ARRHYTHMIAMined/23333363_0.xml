<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to analyze the current burden of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> in Danish Fontan patients and furthermore, to estimate the future burden from analysis of mortality and the current burden related to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Danish citizens with Fontan completion from 1981 to 2009 were identified (n=235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surviving patients performed exercise test, Holter monitoring, echocardiography, pulmonary function test, and blood sampling and medical history was retrieved from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six (11%) patients died or had heart transplantation (HTx) after a mean (±SD) post-Fontan follow-up of 8.3±5.7years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (n=8), a linear probability of HTx-free survival was observed and estimated to 99.1% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> increased significantly with age and was found in 32% and 85% of patients ≥20years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, from survival data and logistic regression models the future prevalence of patients, clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> were estimated, revealing a considerable augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, resting and maximum cardiac index, resting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index and pulmonary diffusing capacity decreased significantly with age while diastolic and systolic ventricular function was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> increased significantly with age in Danish Fontan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The future Fontan burden was estimated showing an increase in the prevalence of older patients, clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
