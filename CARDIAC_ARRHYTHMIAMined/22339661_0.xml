<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This function operates in AAI/R mode with backup VP during <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of "Generation MVP" study was to assess the VP burden and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (AA) burden according to indication of pacing and MVP™ function programming of AdaptaDR implantable pacemaker (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The multicenter observational "Generation MVP" study included 220 patients aged 75.9 ± 11 years (men = 52%) implanted for sinus node dysfunction (SND; n = 115) or atrio-ventricular block (AVB; n = 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Programming MVP function has been left to the physician's discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percentage of VP and AA burden (percentage of time spent in AA) stored in memories were assessed at 2 and 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 220 patients were followed at 2 months (174 MVP [On], 46 MVP [off]) and at 10 months (165 MVP [On], 55 MVP [off]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median percentage of VP is significantly lower when MVP is programmed [On] versus [off] at 2 and 10 months follow-up for SND and AVB indications of pacing (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, programming MVP function is performed at middle term (10 months) for 84% of patients with SND and 65% of patients with AVB: median percentage of VP is as low as 0.6% for patients with SND and 12% for patients with AVB versus 95% for SND and 99% for AVB when MVP function is programmed [off](P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median AA burden was significantly lower when MVP function was programmed [On] versus [off] at 2 months (8.7% vs 28%; P &lt; 0.001) and 10 months (1% vs 22%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study programming MVP function decreases percentage of VP at 2 and 10 months for patients paced for SND or AVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover median AA burden is reduced when MVP function was programmed [On] vs [off] at two follow-ups </plain></SENT>
