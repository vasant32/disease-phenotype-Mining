<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited data on the utility of catheter ablation for the treatment of MMVT in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study details a series of case reports from multiple centers where combined epicardial-endocardial ablation was performed in a highly selected group of patients with HCM-related MMVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 10 patients with HCM-related MMVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pericardial access was achieved using the percutaneous subxyphoid approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epicardial and endocardial ventricular 3D bipolar voltage maps were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation sites were identified using a combination of entrainment, activation, late/fractionated potential, and pace mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological-identified epicardial scar was present in 8 (80%) patients, endocardial scar in 6 (60%), and no scar in 1 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 5 patients with inducible, stable MMVT, 3 cases were successfully terminated with ablation from the epicardium and 1 from the endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The case that failed catheter ablation required surgical cryoablation to abolish the incessant VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 patients, 4 underwent epicardial and endocardial ablation of sites with good pace maps and late/fractionated potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No ablation was performed in the remaining patient because of noninducibility and lack of identifiable scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After 37Â±17 months (limits, 2 to 62 months; median, 37 months), the freedom from recurrent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks was 78% (7/9 patients) in those who underwent ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In highly selected patients with HCM, combined epicardial and endocardial mapping and ablation is a feasible and reasonably efficacious option for MMVT if refractory to aggressive trials of antiarrhythmic drugs and antitachycardia pacing </plain></SENT>
