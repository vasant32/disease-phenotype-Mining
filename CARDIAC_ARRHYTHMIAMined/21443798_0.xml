<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of a reliable, accurate, non-invasive and robust method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection could assists cardiologists in the study of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper provides a method for morphological heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection which might have different shapes in one category and also different <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> in relation to the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distinctive property of this method in addition to accuracy is the robustness of that, in presence of Gaussian noise, time and amplitude shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this work 2nd, 3rd and 4th order cumulants of the ECG beat are calculated and modeled by linear combinations of Hermitian basis functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, the parameters of each cumulant model are used as feature vectors to classify five different ECG beats namely as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>, APC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> using 1-Nearest Neighborhood (1-NN) classifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, after classifying each model, a final decision making rule apply to these specified classes and the type of ECG beat is defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The experiment was applied for a set of ECG beats consist of 9367 samples in 5 different categories from <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>/BIH heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity of 99.67% and the sensitivity of 98.66% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection are achieved which indicates the power of the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the accuracy of the system remained almost intact in the presence of Gaussian noise, time shift and amplitude shift of ECG signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a novel and robust methodology in morphological heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The methodology based on the Hermite model of the Higher-Order Statistics (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi> in suppressing morphological variations of different class-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and also reducing the effects of Gaussian noise, made <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37859">HOS</z:chebi>, suitable for detection morphological heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The proposed method exploits these properties in conjunction with Hermitian model to perform an efficient and reliable classification approach to detect five morphological heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>And the time consumption of this method for each beat is less than the period of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beat </plain></SENT>
