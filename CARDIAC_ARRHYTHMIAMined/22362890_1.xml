<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> is suggested to play a role in favoring the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed whether vitamin E, a known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, or markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are associated with AF recurrence in patients undergoing electric cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 144 patients (83 men; mean age, 71.1±5.4 years) underwent successful biphasic electric cardioversion of nonvalvular persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At baseline, urinary 8-isoprostaglandin F2α and serum soluble NOX2-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (sNOX2-dp), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and vitamin E levels were measured in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 3 months of clinical follow-up, including an office visit with ECG every week or in cases of symptom recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 94 patients maintained sinus rhythm, whereas 50 experienced AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted analysis, left atrial diameter and levels of urinary isoprostanes and serum sNOX2-dp and hs-CRP were significantly higher and serum vitamin E lower in patients with AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable Cox analysis, serum vitamin E (hazard ratio, 0.734; 95% CI, 0.605-0.891; P&lt;0.001) and, to a lesser extent, hs-CRP (P=0.047) remained significantly associated with AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary isoprostanes and serum sNOX2-dp levels were inversely correlated with serum vitamin E level (r=-0.626, P&lt;0.001, and r=-0.460, P&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that low serum vitamin E levels are associated with AF recurrence in patients who underwent cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because vitamin E inversely correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, the findings reinforce the hypothesis of an interplay between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and AF </plain></SENT>
