<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation at the ostial or antral level usually is sufficient for treatment of true paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For persistent AF ablation, drivers and perpetuators outside of the pulmonary veins are responsible for AF maintenance and have to be targeted to achieve satisfying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both complex fractionated atrial electrogram (CFAE) ablation and linear ablation are added to pulmonary vein isolation for persistent AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, ablation failure and necessity of repeat ablations are still frequent, especially after persistent AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein reconduction is the main reason for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence after paroxysmal and to a lesser extent after persistent AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure of persistent AF ablation mostly is a consequence of inadequate trigger ablation, substrate modification or incompletely ablated or reconducting linear lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review we will discuss these points responsible for AF recurrence after ablation and review current possibilities on how to overcome these limitations </plain></SENT>
