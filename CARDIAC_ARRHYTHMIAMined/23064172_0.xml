<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty four hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded in 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and echocardiography left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45%.Sixty age and sex- matched individuals with no obvious evidence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> were also evaluated for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) were evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects being infrequent [ &lt; 30 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> per hour], in 21 (35%) and frequent [ &gt; 30 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> per hour] in 39 (65%).Multiform extra systoles were recorded in 44 (73.3%) subjects, ventricular couplets in 50 (83.4%), and non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) in 28 (46.7%) of the 60 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the controls, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> were seen in 27(45%) and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the controls had multiform extra systole, ventricular couplets or NSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse relationships were found between ejection fraction and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> per h ( P-value &lt; 0.001), ventricular couplet per 24h (P-value &lt; 0.001) and NSVT per hour (P-value 0.002).Time domain heart rate variability measures i.eMean Standard Deviation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> RR Interval (SDNN), mean Percentage of Adjacent NN Intervals in a 24 hour recording which differ by at least 50ms (pNN550) , mean Root Mean Square Successive Difference in RR Interval (rMSSD) were significantly lower in the subjects compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding P-values were &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001, &lt; 0.001 respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that ambulant out patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, have significantly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and narrow heart rate variability compared to healthy individuals of comparable age and gender </plain></SENT>
