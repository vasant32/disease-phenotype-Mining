<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of ARVC is categorized as Naxos disease, which is characterized by ARVC and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cutaneous disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the Plakoglobin (Jup) gene, which encodes a major component of the desmosome and the adherens junction, had been identified in Naxos patients, although the underlying mechanism remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We generated Jup mutant mice by ablating Jup in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jup mutant mice largely recapitulated the clinical manifestation of human ARVC: ventricular dilation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, cardiac dysfunction and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultra-structural analyses revealed that desmosomes were absent in Jup mutant myocardia, whereas adherens junctions and gap junctions were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were associated with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in Jup mutant hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Massive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> contributed to the cardiomyocyte dropout in Jup mutant hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the increase of β-catenin at adherens junctions in Jup mutant cardiomyoicytes, the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated signaling was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta-mediated signaling was found significantly elevated in Jup mutant cardiomyocytes at the early stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, suggesting an important pathogenic pathway for Jup-related ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings have provided further insights for the pathogenesis of ARVC and potential therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
