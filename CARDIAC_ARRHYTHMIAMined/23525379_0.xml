<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence demonstrates that <z:mp ids='MP_0002925'>abnormal cardiovascular development</z:mp> is involved in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the coding exons and splice sites of the NKX2.5 gene, which encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor pivotal for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiovascular morphogenesis, were sequenced in 110 unrelated index patients with familial AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the mutation carrier and 200 unrelated ethnically-matched healthy individuals serving as controls were subsequently genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease-causing potential of the identified NKX2.5 variation was predicted by MutationTaster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional characteristics of the mutant NKX2.5 protein were analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, a novel heterozygous NKX2.5 mutation, p.F145S, was identified in a family with AF transmitted as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait, which co-segregated with AF in the family with complete penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detected substitution, which altered the amino acid completely conserved evolutionarily across species, was absent in 400 control chromosomes and was automatically predicted to be causative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis demonstrated that the NKX2.5 mutant was associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of the NKX2.5 loss-of-function mutation with increased susceptibility to familial AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present study provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism underlying AF, suggesting the potential implications for the early prophylaxis and allele-specific therapy of AF </plain></SENT>
