<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in SCN5A, the gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels, cause a spectrum of arrhythmic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, sinoatrial node (SAN) dysfunction occurs in patients with both loss- and gain-of-function SCN5A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored for corresponding alterations in SAN function and intracardiac conduction and clarified possible mechanisms underlying these in an established mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> type 3 model carrying a mutation equivalent to human SCN5A-ΔKPQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological characterizations of SAN function in living animals and in vitro sinoatrial preparations were compared with cellular SAN and two-dimensional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519523" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">tissue models</z:e> exploring the consequences of Scn5a+/ΔKPQ mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scn5a+/ΔKPQ mice showed prolonged electrocardiographic QT and corrected QT intervals confirming long QT phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They showed frequent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>, sinus pause/arrest, and significantly longer sinus node recovery times, suggesting compromised pacemaker activity compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic waveforms suggested depressed intra-atrial, atrioventricular node, and intraventricular conduction in Scn5a+/ΔKPQ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated Scn5a+/ΔKPQ sinoatrial preparations similarly showed lower mean intrinsic heart rates and overall slower conduction through the SAN to the surrounding atrium than did <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations of both single SAN cells as well as two-dimensional SAN-atrial models could reproduce the experimental observations of impaired pacemaker and sinoatrial conduction in terms of changes produced by both augmented tail and reduced total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the gain-of-function <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> type 3 murine Scn5a+/ΔKPQ cardiac system, in overlap with corresponding features reported in loss-of-function <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel mutations, shows compromised SAN pacemaker and conduction function explicable in modeling studies through a combination of augmented tail and reduced peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
