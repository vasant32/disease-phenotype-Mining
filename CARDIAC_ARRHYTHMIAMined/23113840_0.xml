<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and cause are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To detect cardiac damage in rattlesnake-bitten horses by measuring cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and evaluating ECG recordings for presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and explore causes of this cardiac damage by measuring venom excretion, anti-venom antibodies, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFα) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: A total of 20 adult horses with a clinical diagnosis of rattlesnake bite and 6 healthy adult horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective clinical study, bite site swabs, blood samples, and urine samples were collected at various time points from 20 horses with a clinical diagnosis of snake bite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous ECG recordings were obtained on the 20 affected horses and 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control horses using 24-hour holter monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were assayed for cTnI, serum samples were assayed for TNFα and anti-venom antibodies, and bite site swabs and urine were assayed for venom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty percent of rattlesnake-bitten horses (8/20) experienced myocardial damage (increased cTnI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent (14/20) experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between cTnI and TNFα (P &lt; .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Horses with cTnI ≥ 2 ng/mL were more likely to have antibody titers &gt;5,000 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found between venom concentration and cTnI, anti-venom antibody titers, TNFα, or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>Cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> in this population of horses indicate that cardiac damage after rattlesnake bite is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rattlesnake-bitten horses should be monitored for signs of cardiac damage and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up should be encouraged to detect delayed cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
