<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial thickness is particularly thick at the ridge between the left pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) and the left atrial appendage (LAA) by dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation outcome was influenced by altering ablation strategies according to the thickness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-LAA ridge using preprocedural multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with AF scheduled for extensive encircling circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (EEPVI) (110 patients) were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the nonmodulation group (32 patients), EEPVI lines were created using a 3.5-mm tip irrigated catheter at a maximum power of 30 W for 20-30 s at each site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the modulation group (78 patients), ablation was extended (40-60 s) at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-LAA ridge if its thickness was &gt;4.0 mm on MDCT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extended ablation at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-LAA ridge was noted in 37 patients in the modulation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 25Â±9 months of follow-up, recurrence was significantly less in the modulation group than in the nonmodulation group (10% vs. 28%; p=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that modifications in the ablation time and left atrium volume index were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free recovery after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence following EEPVI could be reduced by modifications in the ablation time at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-LAA ridge </plain></SENT>
