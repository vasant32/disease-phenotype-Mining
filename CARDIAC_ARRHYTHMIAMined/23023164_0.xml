<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Page (1994) holds that people with blood-injury <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349231" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">phobia</z:e> faint, because they are disgust sensitive and disgust facilitates fainting by eliciting parasympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the following two hypotheses: (1) Disgusting pictures elicit more disgust in blood-injection-injury-anxious people with a history of fainting than they do in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Disgust causes parasympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 24 participants with high blood-injection-injury fear and a history of fainting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> relevant situations and 24 subjects with average blood-injection-injury fear and no fainting history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed self-reported feelings of disgust, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and faintness and reactions in heart rate, skin conductance, blood pressure and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the confrontation with disgusting pictures with and without blood content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not find any evidence that the blood-injection-injury anxious subjects were more disgust sensitive than the control subjects and we also did not find any evidence that disgust elicits parasympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
