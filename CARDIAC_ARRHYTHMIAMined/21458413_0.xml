<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are caused by genetic defects in ion channels and associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in these channels often do not affect their biophysical properties, but rather interfere with their trafficking to the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, strategies that could reroute the mutated channels to the membrane should be sufficient to restore the electrical properties of the affected cells, thereby suppressing the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified here both, embryonic and adult zebrafish breakdance (bre) as a valuable model for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms of adult homozygous bre mutants exhibit significant QT prolongation caused by delayed repolarization of the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further show that the bre mutation (zERG(I59S)) disrupts ERG protein trafficking, thereby reducing the amount of active <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels on the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, improvement of channel trafficking by cisapride or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethylsulfoxid</z:chebi> is sufficient to reconstitute ERG channels on the cell membrane in a manner that suffices to suppress the Long-QT induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in breakdance mutant zebrafish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we show for the first time that therapeutic intervention can cure protein trafficking defects and the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
