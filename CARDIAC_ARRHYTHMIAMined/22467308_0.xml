<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This differential may result from age-related structural remodeling (<z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) or electrical remodeling of ventricular myocytes or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used optical mapping and microelectrode recordings in Langendorff-perfused hearts and patch-clamp recordings in isolated ventricular myocytes from aged (24-26 mo) and young (3-4 mo) rats to assess susceptibility to EADs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during either <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> with ANG II (2 μM) or ionic stress with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> (2.7 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANG II caused EAD-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in 16 of 19 aged hearts (83%) after 32 ± 7 min but in 0 of 9 young hearts (0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANG II-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was suppressed with KN-93 (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor) and the reducing agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>Hypokalemia</z:hpo> caused EAD-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in 11 of 11 aged hearts (100%) after 7.4 ± 0.4 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 young hearts, however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> did not occur in 6 hearts (43%) or was delayed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (31 ± 22 min, P &lt; 0.05) in 8 hearts (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patch-clamped myocytes, ANG II and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> (n = 6) induced EADs and triggered activity in both age groups (P = not significant) at a cycle length of &gt;0.5 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When myocytes of either age group were coupled to a virtual fibroblast using the dynamic patch-clamp technique, EADs arose in both groups at a cycle length of &lt;0.5 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aged ventricles had significantly greater <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and reduced connexin43 gap junction density compared with young hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of differential age-related sensitivity at the single cell level in EAD susceptibility indicates that increased ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the aged heart plays a key role in increasing vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> induced by oxidative and ionic stress </plain></SENT>
