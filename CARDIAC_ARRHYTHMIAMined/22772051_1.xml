<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The novel Achieve inner lumen mapping catheter designed to be used in conjunction with the cryoballoon, serves as both a guidewire and a mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the latter to verification of electrical isolation with the 'traditional' circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We assigned 40 consecutive patients matched for age and left atrial diameter suffering of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> to cryoballoon PVI using either the circular mapping catheter or the Achieve as a mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duration of procedure as well as fluoroscopy times were significantly lower in the Achieve group than in the circular mapping catheter group (111 ± 14 min vs. 126 ± 13 min, P &lt; 0.005 and 22 ± 5 min vs. 29 ± 4 min, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of mean degree of occlusion, mean minimal temperatures, and PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation could be documented by real-time recordings in 55% of veins in the Achieve group with mean time to isolation of 65 ± 23 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation in conjunction with the novel Achieve is feasible, safe, and affords PVI in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> veins in similar proportions to the approach with the traditional guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, if compared to the procedure with the circular mapping catheter, cryoballoon ablation with the Achieve is significantly faster and associated to shorter fluoroscopy times </plain></SENT>
