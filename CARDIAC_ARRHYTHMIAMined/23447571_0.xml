<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic response (LV dP/dtmax) of multisite and BiV pacing using a quadripolar LV lead.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 21 patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy, a quadripolar LV lead and conventional right atrial and ventricular leads were connected to an external pacing system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A guidewire pressure sensor was placed in the LV for continuous dP/dt measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four multisite pacing configurations were tested three times each and compared with BiV pacing using the distal LV electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had useable haemodynamic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median increase in LV dP/dtmax with BiV vs. atrial-only pacing was 8.2% (interquartile range 2.3%, 15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With multisite pacing using distal and proximal LV electrodes, median increase in LV dP/dtmax was 10.2% compared with atrial-only pacing (interquartile range 6.1%, 25.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 16 of 19 patients (84%), two or more of the four multisite pacing configurations increased LV dP/dtmax compared with BiV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 72% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested configurations of multisite pacing produced greater LV dP/dtmax than obtained with BiV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pacing from most distal and proximal electrodes was the most common optimal configuration, superior to BiV pacing in 74% of patients.CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients, multisite pacing improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> systolic function further compared with BiV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pacing with the most distal and proximal electrodes of the quadripolar LV lead most commonly yielded greatest LV dP/dtmax </plain></SENT>
