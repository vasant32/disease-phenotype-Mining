<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine whether sarcolemmal dysfunction could be identified with muscle velocity recovery cycles (MVRCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven genetically confirmed ATS patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MVRCs were recorded with 1, 2, and 5 conditioning stimuli and with single conditioning stimuli during intermittent repetitive stimulation at 20 Hz, in addition to the long exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ATS patients had longer relative refractory periods (P &lt; 0.0001) and less early supernormality, consistent with membrane depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients had reduced enhancement of late supernormality with 5 conditioning stimuli (P &lt; 0.0001), and less latency reduction during repetitive stimulation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were separated completely from controls by combining MVRC and repetitive stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MVRCs combined with repetitive stimulation differentiated ATS patients from controls more effectively than the conventional long-exercise test </plain></SENT>
