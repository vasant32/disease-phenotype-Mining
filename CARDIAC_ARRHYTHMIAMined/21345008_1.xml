<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Partial pneumonectomy (PNX) in mice results in compensatory growth in the remaining lung and is a useful model for lung repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, common pitfalls to the technique present a challenge for researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A complete description of murine PNX is thus provided, with a modification that, in our hands, enhanced animal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 ± 2 weeks old mice were anesthetized using 5% inhalational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> via tracheotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilation was provided using a Harvard Model 687 ventilator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a procedure optimized to be performed in ≤20 min, left lateral thoracotomy was used to access to the left lung, which was grasped with a blunt forceps just distal to the hilum and clipped using a single 5-mm neuro clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left lung was resected, leaving a small rim of lung tissue immediately adjacent to the clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The thoracotomy was closed, and while anesthesia was titrated, <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> saline was injected subcutaneously to replace insensible fluid losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Upon return of spontaneous breaths, the trachea was decannulated, and the tracheotomy was closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Even when performed by a single operator, this modified technique produced a survival rate of &gt;85% during the procedure and &gt;90% up to seven days postoperatively in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57BL/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimizing the time required to perform left lobe pneumonectomy is critical for animal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a 5-mm neuro clip, rather than silk suture, to isolate the lobe streamlines the procedure, helps reduce cardiac arrythmia, and results in significantly increased rates of intraoperative and immediate postoperative survival </plain></SENT>
