<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Procedural safety and success depend on patient comfort, compliance, and immobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is difficult to achieve with <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> and opiate boluses that are the mainstay of current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> infusion sedation administered to patients without assisted ventilation for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Procedural data from 1000 consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sedation with 2% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures without assisted ventilation and was administered, monitored, and controlled by electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were adverse sedative affects including (i) respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SpO(2)&lt; 90% for &gt;20 s) and (ii) persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> [systolic blood pressure (SBP)&lt;90 mmHg at minimum sedation level] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included full recovery within 60 min and procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 1000 ablations, 506 ablations were performed for persistent and 494 for paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average patient age was 60.1 ± 11.3 years (72.3% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> was commenced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a mean infusion rate of 18.5 ± 4.8 mL/h with a mean baseline SBP of 140.3 ± 19.9 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean procedure time was 148.7 ± 57.7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Adverse sedative effects necessitating cessation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and switch to midazolam bolus sedation occurred in 15.6% of patients (13.6% due to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, 1.9% due to respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and 0.1% due to <z:mp ids='MP_0000622'>hypersalivation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who had persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were older (62.9 ± 11.2 vs. 60.0 ± 11.4 years, P= 0.011) and more likely to be female (39.5 vs. 23.7%, P&lt; 0.001) than those who tolerated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patient age correlated to maximum blood pressure drop with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (R(2)= 0.101, P&lt; 0.001) and inversely correlated to mean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> infusion rate (R(2)= 0.066, P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No procedures were abandoned due to adverse effects of sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered within 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Serious procedural complications, unrelated to sedation, occurred in 0.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> successfully treated with percutaneous pericardiocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sedation with 2% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> infusion administered by cardiologists without assisted ventilation is safe, effective, and practical for use in AF ablation without serious or residual complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this setting, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adverse effect requiring cessation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> in ∼14% </plain></SENT>
