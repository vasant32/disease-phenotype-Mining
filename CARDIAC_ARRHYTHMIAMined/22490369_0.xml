<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current evidence indicates that, despite their proven efficacy, the Cox-Maze procedure and its modifications require cardiopulmonary bypass and cannot be easily justified in the case of AF without other indication for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing cardiac surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e>, concomitant ablation techniques using modifications of the Maze and alternative energy sources appear to be safe and effective in treating AF, especially in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive epicardial ablation has been recently developed and can be performed on a beating heart through small access incision ports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various techniques combining pulmonary vein isolation, ganglionated plexi ablation, and left atrial lines have been tried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial results are promising but further clinical experience is required to establish ideal lesion sets, appropriate energy sources, and the benefit-risk ratio of such an approach in patients without other indication for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of surgical ablation in the current management of AF is under investigation </plain></SENT>
