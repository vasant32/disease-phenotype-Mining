<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine causes modest QTc prolongation, yet it shows antiarrhythmic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the association between prolonged QTc and risk of SCD, and the effect of ranolazine on this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The relationship between baseline QTc and SCD was studied in 6492 patients with non-ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) randomized to placebo or ranolazine in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the placebo group, an abnormal QTc interval (≥450 ms in men, ≥470 ms in women) was associated with a two-fold increased risk of SCD (hazard ratio, HR, 2.3, P = 0.005) after adjustment for other risk factors (age ≥75 years, NYHA class III/IV, high TIMI risk score, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> ≥8 beats, digitalis, and antiarrhythmics) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the ranolazine group, the association between abnormal QTc and SCD was similar to placebo, but not significant (HR 1.8, P = 0.074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between placebo and ranolazine in the risk for SCD in patients with abnormal QTc (HR 0.78, P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When QTc was used as a continuous variable, for every 10 ms increase in QTc, hazard rate for SCD increased significantly by 8% (P = 0.007) in the placebo group, and only by 2.9% (P = 0.412; P for interaction=0.25) in the ranolazine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In NSTEACS patients treated with placebo, prolonged QTc was a significant independent predictor for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine, compared with placebo, was not associated with increased risk for SCD in patients with prolonged QTc </plain></SENT>
