<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Diastolic spontaneous Ca(2+) waves (DCWs) are recognized as important contributors to triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DCWs are thought to arise when [Ca(2+)] in sarcoplasmic reticulum ([Ca(2+)](SR)) reaches a certain threshold level, which might be reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> as a consequence of sensitization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors (RyR2s) to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated the mechanisms of DCW generation in myocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased hearts, using a canine model of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The frequency of DCWs, recorded during periodic pacing in the presence of a Î²-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> myocytes than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather than occurring immediately on reaching a final [Ca(2+)](SR), DCWs arose with a distinct time delay after attaining steady [Ca(2+)](SR) in both experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of [Ca(2+)](SR) recovery after the SR Ca(2+) release was similar between the groups, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> myocytes the latency to DCWs was shorter, and the [Ca(2+)](SR) at DCW initiation was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The restitution of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) transients, assessed by a 2-pulse protocol, was significantly faster in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> myocytes than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-related alterations in myocyte Ca(2+) cycling were mimicked by the RyR2 <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reducing agent, mercaptopropionylglycine, or the CaMKII inhibitor, KN93, decreased DCW frequency and normalized restitution of Ca(2+) release in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The attainment of a certain threshold [Ca(2+)](SR) is not sufficient for the generation of DCWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postrelease Ca(2+) signaling refractoriness critically influences the occurrence of DCWs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Shortened Ca(2+) signaling refractoriness due to RyR2 phosphorylation and oxidation is responsible for the increased rate of DCWs observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> myocytes and could provide a substrate for synchronization of arrhythmogenic events at the tissue level in hearts prone to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
