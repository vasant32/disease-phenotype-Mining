<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous analyses used administrative data or focused on single-center outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the most common operations, patient characteristics, and postoperative outcomes using a multicenter clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included adults (aged â‰¥ 18 years) listed in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (2000-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe patient characteristics and morbidity and mortality, and examine congenital procedures in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to permit consideration of the primary dataset within a broader context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5265 patients (68 centers) from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 20-35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common preoperative risk factors included noncardiac abnormalities (17%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, in-hospital mortality was 2.1%, 27% had 1 or more complication, and median length of stay was 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common operations included right ventricular outflow tract procedures (21%) and pacemaker/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> procedures (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We further evaluated cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in more than 100 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mortality ranged from 0% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> repair) to 11% (Fontan revision/conversion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Separate evaluation of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database revealed 39,872 adults undergoing congenital heart operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most adult congenital heart operations listed in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database are performed in the third to fourth decades of life; approximately half are for right heart pathology or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Many patients have complications, but mortality is low with the exception of those undergoing Fontan revision/conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Many more adults undergoing congenital heart surgery are entered into the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database </plain></SENT>
