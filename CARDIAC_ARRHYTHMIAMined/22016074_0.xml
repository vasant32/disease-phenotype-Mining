<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) depends, in part, on the programming of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We assessed events treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks or antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in the Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing with AV Search Hysteresis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> (INTRINSIC RV) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ATP and shock episodes from 1530 patients with dual-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For episodes in which electrograms were stored and adjudicated, ATP was delivered for 763 episodes (182 patients), shock-only was delivered for 300 episodes (146 patients), and shock following ATP was delivered for 81 episodes (56 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATP was delivered appropriately for 507 episodes (130 patients), with 93% success, and inappropriately for 256 episodes (89 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For ATP episodes, appropriate (VT: 170 ± 28 bpm) and inappropriate (not VT: 165 ± 21 bpm) rates did not differ (P = .16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the initial therapy was shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> rates were higher for appropriate therapy than for inappropriate therapy (224 ± 46 bpm vs 187 ± 31 bpm; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate ATP was more likely to be followed by a shock (odds ratio 2.49; 95% confidence interval 1.56-3.97; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight percent (225 of 381) of shocked episodes had rates &lt;200 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For episodes between 200 and 250 bpm, 20% (23 of 113) were polymorphic VT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, 59% were monomorphic VT, 19% were supraventricular, and &lt;1% was artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For episodes &gt;250 bpm, 37% were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, 28% polymorphic VT, 23% monomorphic VT, 7% supraventricular, and 5% artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a general <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> population, ATP treated VT effectively or obviated the need for shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> &lt;250 bpm were not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Proper zone programming may identify and treat VT without shock </plain></SENT>
