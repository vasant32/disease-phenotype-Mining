<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the myocardial iron loads of 88 TM patients from Taiwan with cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and assessed the correlation between cardiac T2* values and serum ferritin levels, liver iron concentration and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also determined the predictive value of these measurements for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In our group of Taiwanese patients, the relative risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 10·36 when cardiac T2* values were less than 10 ms (compared with ≥10 ms) and 1·98 when serum ferritin levels increased &gt;2500 ng mL(-1) (compared with ≤2500 ng mL(-1) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels correlated with cardiac T2* values in patients with abnormal myocardial iron loads (T2* &lt; 20 ms, r = -0·48, P = 0·004, n = 34), but LVEF (measured by echocardiography) gave no indication of excess myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> (r = -0·07, P = 0·52) or of the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
