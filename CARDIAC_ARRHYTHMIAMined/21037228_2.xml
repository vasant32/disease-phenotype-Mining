<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hearts from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-induced diabetic rats have previously been shown to have impaired intercellular electrical coupling, due to reorganization (lateralization) of connexin43 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the resulting reduction in conduction reserve, conduction velocity in diabetic hearts is more sensitive to conditions that reduce cellular excitability or intercellular electrical coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> is a known risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>, a condition associated with both reduced cellular excitability and reduced intercellular coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) is known to be part of the response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and may contribute to the intercellular uncoupling by causing increased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> and lysophosphatidyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Normally perfused diabetic hearts are known to exhibit increased iPLA(2) activity and may thus be particularly sensitive to further activation of these enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used voltage-sensitive dye mapping to assess changes in conduction velocity in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in Langendorff-perfused STZ-induced diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conduction slowing in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was significantly larger in STZ-induced diabetic hearts compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, slowing of conduction velocity in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> was also more pronounced in STZ-induced diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of iPLA(2) activity using bromoenol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25000">lactone</z:chebi> (BEL; 10 Î¼M) had no effect on the response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in healthy control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in STZ-induced diabetic hearts, BEL significantly reduced the amount of conduction slowing observed beginning 5 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BEL treatment also significantly increased the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in STZ-induced diabetic hearts but had no effect on the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in healthy control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that iPLA(2) activation in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in STZ-induced diabetic hearts is more pronounced than in control hearts and that this response is a significant contributor to arrhythmogenic conduction slowing </plain></SENT>
