<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the course of catheter ablation of AF, there are often transitions from AF to left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) and from faster to slower AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize the time course of change in AFL rate during AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourier transformation was performed on 16 s segments of coronary sinus and ablation catheter bipolar electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ablation-induced AF-to-AFL and AFL-to-AFL transitions were defined as a sudden drop in the dominant frequency (DF) of at least 10 bpm, followed by a regular rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-five transitions were detected in 24 ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean DF in AF was 5.31 ± 0.79 Hz, which was significantly faster than AFL, 4.52 ± 0.62 Hz (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean ΔDF at transitions was -51 ± 16 bpm in AF and -40 ± 14 bpm in AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dominant frequency slope was positive (rate increased) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the transitions during AF (P&lt; 0.0001) and in 11 of 14 transitions in AFL (P= 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time constant of the DF recovery curve was 161 ± 105 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After ablation-induced transition from AF to AFL, or faster to slower AFL, there is a progressive increase in AFL rate over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this acceleration is uncertain, but the time constant of this rate increase is consistent with the recovery of the slow/ultraslow <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current in the setting of established electrical remodelling </plain></SENT>
