<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While it is widely accepted that the type 2 ryanodine receptor (Ryr2) is the major Ca(2+) release channel in excitation-contraction coupling, the role of these channels in setting a consistent beating rate remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gain-of-function RYR2 mutations in humans and genetically engineered mouse models are known to cause Ca(2+) leak, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embryonic stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes lacking Ryr2 display slower beating rates, but no supporting in vivo evidence has been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that RYR2 loss-of-function would reduce heart rate and rhythmicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated inducible, tissue-specific Ryr2 knockout mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> âˆ¼50% loss of RYR2 protein in the heart but not in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography, working heart perfusion, and in vivo ECG telemetry demonstrated that deletion of Ryr2 was sufficient to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results also show that cardiac Ryr2 knockout mice exhibit functional and structural hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results illustrate that the RYR2 channel plays an essential role in pacing heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that RYR2 loss-of-function can lead to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> typically associated with gain-of-function mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given that RYR2 levels can be reduced in pathological conditions, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, we predict that RYR2 loss contributes to disease-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
