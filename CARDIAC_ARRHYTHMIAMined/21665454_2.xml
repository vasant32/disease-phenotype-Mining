<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of Danshensu (DSS), a water-soluble active component of Danshen, on <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are the first to report that DSS reversed Cx43 down-regulation in ventricular tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in rats was produced using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (Iso) treatment (2.5 mg/kg/d, s.c.) for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSS (3 and 10 mg/kg/d, i.p.) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> (Val) (10 mg/kg, i.g.) were administered on days 4-7 of Iso-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart weight index, hemodynamic parameters, and ECG II parameters were monitored and recorded; protein expression of left ventricular connexin 43 (Cx43) and the activity of the redox system were assayed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were produced using a coronary ligation/reperfusion procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that DSS treatment significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0002834'>decreased heart weight</z:mp>/body weight (HW/BW) and left ventricular weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective role of DSS against Iso-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> was further confirmed using ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (VT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) and arrhythmic scores were higher in the model group and were suppressed by DSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DSS decreased the serum and myocardium levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and malondialdehyde (CK, LDH, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and increased serum activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cx43 expression in the left ventricle was down-regulated, and there was significant <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in this model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DSS reversed the down-regulated Cx43 protein levels and showed potent anti-oxidative activities and cellular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that DSS can prevent cardiac I/R injury and improve cardiac function in a rat model of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, the effects partially resulting from <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and the protection from Cx43 expression </plain></SENT>
