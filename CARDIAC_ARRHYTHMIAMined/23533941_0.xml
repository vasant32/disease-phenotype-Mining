<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the time-domain nonspectral evaluation, the SDNN (P &lt; 0.001), SDNNi (P &lt; 0.05), RMSDD (P &lt; 0.01), and pNN50 (P &lt; 0.01) were found to be significantly lower in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> intoxication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spectral analysis of the data recorded during the first 5 minutes after intensive care unit admission showed that the values of the nLF (P &lt; 0.05) and the LF/HF ratio (P = 0.001) were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> intoxication group, while the nHF (P = 0.001) values were significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency-domain spectral analysis of the data recorded during the last 5 minutes showed a lower nHF (P = 0.001) in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> intoxication group than in the controls, and the LF/HF ratio was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the intoxication group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LF/HF ratio was higher in the seven children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provided us with a starting point for the value of HRV analysis in determining the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> poisoning patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRV can be used as a noninvasive testing method in determining the treatment and prognosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> poisoning patients </plain></SENT>
