<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Fifty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and SDB (33 male; mean age, 61 years) underwent Holter electrocardiogram and portable sleep monitoring simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The circadian variation in positive T-wave alternans (TWA; &gt;65μV) was determined during 6-h intervals (0-6, 6-12, 12-18, and 18-24h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated across a 24-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into 2 groups based on whether respiratory disturbance index was ≥20events/h (Group A, n=24) or not (Group B, n=26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of positive TWA, parameters in HRV and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (&gt;5 beats) were compared between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of positive TWA in Group A was significantly higher than that in Group B in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6-h intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-frequency and high-frequency powers of HRV were significantly lower in Group A than in Group B across a 24-h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (46% vs. 19%, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: SDB may induce cardiac electrical instability associated with life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> across a 24-h period in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
