<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the electrophysiological properties and vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induction from these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Transseptal endocardial and percutaneous epicardial mapping were performed in a porcine model (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two opposing 4-mm electrophysiological catheters were positioned endocardially and epicardially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A circular mapping catheter (CMC) was positioned at the ostium of the common inferior pulmonary vein (CIPV) recording left atrial (LA)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endocardial and epicardial effective refractory periods (ERPs) at two basic cycle lengths (CLs) of 600 and 400 ms were recorded from four anatomic locations (CIPV, LA appendage, right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, and LA posterior wall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial repetitive response (ARR) induction was also tested from endocardial and epicardial sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 254 ERP measurements (mean 36.3 per animal) and 84 induction attempts (mean 12 per animal) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ERP was significantly shorter in the epicardium compared to the endocardium at basic CL of 400 ms (P = 0.006) but not at CL of 600 ms (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, only the epicardium demonstrated ERP shortening when the CL of the basic drive was shortened (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ARR could be induced more often from the epicardium (P = 0.002) and fibrillatory activity with epicardial/endocardial dissociation was recorded (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, the earliest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> activation site on the CMC was noted to be different in 16.5% of cases during epicardial and endocardial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The electrophysiological characteristics of the atrial epicardium are different from the endocardium with a shorter ERP and more frequent ARR induction by programed stimulation </plain></SENT>
