<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if there were any interactions between cardiac devices and small bowel capsules secondary to electromagnetic interference (EMI) in patients who have undergone small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Authors conducted a chart review of 20 patients with a cardiac pacemaker (CP) or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) who underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during their SBCE from 2003-2008. authors searched for unexplained electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, changes in CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> set parameters, any abnormality in transmitted capsule data, and adverse clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no adverse events or hemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> set parameters were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> were also found in pre- or post- SBCE ECG tracings and the CP behavior during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> appeared appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients seemed to have episodes of undersensing by the CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, similar findings were documented in ECGs taken outside the time frame of the SBCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was observed to have a low signal encountered from the capsule resulting in lack of localization, but no images were lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Capsule-induced EMI remains a possibility but is unlikely to be clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CP-induced interference of SBCE is also possible, but is infrequent and does not result in loss of images transmitted by the capsule </plain></SENT>
