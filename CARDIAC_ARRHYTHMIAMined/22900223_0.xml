<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the effect of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> on postoperative outcome remain limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the effects preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> on patients' outcome following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected departmental data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent cardiac surgery over 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our cohort consisted of 3777 consecutive patients divided into <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 413, 11%) and sinus rhythm (n = 3364, 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed significantly increased mortality and major complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared to sinus rhythm patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using multiple logistic regression analysis and after accounting for Euro SCORE as a confounding variable, we found that preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> significantly increases the risk of mortality (OR 1.7), low cardiac output state (OR 1.3), prolonged ventilation (OR 1.4), infective complication (OR 1.5), gastrointestinal complications (OR 2.0), and intensive care unit readmission (OR 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in cardiac surgery patients increases their risk of mortality and major complications following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical strategies such as Cox-Maze procedure may be beneficial in these patients </plain></SENT>
