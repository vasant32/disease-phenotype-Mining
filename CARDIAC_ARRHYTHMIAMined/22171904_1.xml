<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although there has been growing concordance over what constitutes best practice in recent guidelines for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), notably regarding <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> use, it remains unclear whether patients are being treated accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aims of this study were to explore the pattern of treatment pathways - i.e. how patients are treated over time - for patients with AF, and to test the hypothesis that comparative to patients in lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk categories (as measured by CHADS(2) score), patients with higher CHADS(2) scores are less likely to discontinue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy or, if not started on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment, more likely to be transferred to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, in keeping with guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A total of 67,857 patients with a diagnosis of AF in practices registered with the General Practice Research Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A series of possible treatment pathways were identified, and for each initial treatment, we estimated the probability of treatment change and the average time that a patient newly diagnosed with AF spent on a particular treatment, projected across 5 years and stratified by CHADS(2) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no relationship between CHADS(2) score and maintenance or discontinuation of particular approaches to antithrombotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While those beginning on antiplatelet therapy were more likely to change treatment than those on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (approximately 60% vs. 50% within the first year), as much as one-third of treatment time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those starting on a therapeutic approach involving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> featured no use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (either as monotherapy or in combination) over the 5-year period, and whether treatment was discontinued or maintained did not vary by CHADS(2) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in treatment pathways controlling for post-2002 diagnoses as against the whole sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although there is more evidence of treatment maintenance than treatment change, especially in the first year after diagnosis, the amount of therapeutic change remains noteworthy and appears higher than in some previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prescription patterns for AF therapy suggest that too few high-risk patients are receiving best practice treatment, and particularly of concern is that some of these patients are being transferred away from best practice treatment over time </plain></SENT>
