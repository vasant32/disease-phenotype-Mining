<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical application of skeletal myoblast transplantation has been curtailed due to arrhythmogenicity and inconsistent therapeutic benefits observed in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these issues may be solved by the use of a new cell-delivery mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is now possible to generate "cell-sheets" using temperature-responsive dishes without artificial scaffolds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to validate the safety and efficacy of epicardial placement of myoblast-sheets (myoblast-sheet therapy) in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: After coronary artery ligation in rats, the same numbers of syngeneic myoblasts were transplanted by intramyocardial injection or cell-sheet placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous radio-telemetry monitoring detected increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, after intramyocardial injection compared to the sham-control, while these were abolished in myoblast-sheet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was conjunct with avoidance of islet-like cell-cluster formation that disrupts electrical conduction, and with prevention of increased arrhythmogenic substrates due to exaggerated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Persistent ectopic donor cells were found in the lung only after intramyocardial injection, strengthening the improved safety of myoblast-sheet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, myoblast-sheet therapy enhanced cardiac function, corresponding to a 9.2-fold increase in donor cell survival, compared to intramyocardial injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both methods achieved reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, attenuated cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and increased neovascular formation, in association with myocardial upregulation of a group of relevant molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern of these beneficial changes was similar between two methods, but the degree was more substantial after myoblast-sheet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cell-sheet technique enhanced safety and therapeutic efficacy of myoblast-based therapy, compared to the current method, thereby paving the way for clinical application </plain></SENT>
