<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of ubiquitin (Ub) in endocytic degradation of hERG channels stably expressed in HEK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> conditions, UbKO, a lysine-less mutant Ub that only supports monoubiquitination, preferentially interacted and selectively enhanced degradation of the mature hERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Vps24 protein, also known as charged multivesicular body protein 3, significantly accelerated degradation of mature hERG channels, whereas knockdown of Vps24 impeded this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the lysosomal inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22689">bafilomycin A1</z:chebi> inhibited degradation of the internalized mature hERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, monoubiquitination directs mature hERG channels to degrade through the multivesicular body/lysosome pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi> inhibited the low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-induced hERG endocytosis and concomitantly led to an accumulation of monoubiquitinated mature hERG channels, suggesting that deubiquitination is also required for the endocytic degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, overexpression of the endosomal deubiquitinating enzyme signal transducing adaptor molecule-binding protein significantly accelerated whereas knockdown of endogenous signal transducing adaptor molecule-binding protein impeded degradation of the mature hERG channels under low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, monoubiquitin dynamically mediates endocytic degradation of mature hERG channels under low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> conditions </plain></SENT>
