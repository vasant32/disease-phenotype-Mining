<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe and illustrate a method to obtain early estimates of the effectiveness of a new version of a medical device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the absence of empirical data, expert opinion may be elicited on the expected difference between the conventional and modified devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bayesian Mixed Treatment Comparison (MTC) meta-analysis can then be used to combine this expert opinion with existing trial data on earlier versions of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We illustrate this approach for a new four-pole implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) compared with conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, and conventional drug therapy for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Existing RCTs were identified from a published systematic review, and we elicited opinion on the difference between four-pole and conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> from experts recruited at a cardiology conference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven experts provided valid probability distributions for the new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> compared with current devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTC model resulted in estimated relative risks of mortality of 0.74 (0.60-0.89) (predictive relative risk [RR] = 0.77 [0.41-1.26]) and 0.83 (0.70-0.97) (predictive RR = 0.84 [0.55-1.22]) with the new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy compared to Class III anti-arrhythmic drug therapy and conventional drug therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results showed negligible differences from the preliminary results for the existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method incorporating expert opinion to adjust for a modification made to an existing device may play a useful role in assisting decision makers to make early informed judgments on the effectiveness of frequently modified healthcare technologies </plain></SENT>
