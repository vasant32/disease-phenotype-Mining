<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (JET) in a modern cohort of pediatric patients, evaluate possible risk factors for JET, and examine the effects of JET on postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>JET is common after congenital heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JET-related mortality has been a rare event at our center, which is different from previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed records for pediatric patients who had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> between January 2006 and June 2010 at a large tertiary-care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a matched case-control study to identify risk factors for JET and a matched-cohort study to compare outcomes between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whenever possible, each JET case was randomly matched to two controls on the basis of lesion, repair, and surgical period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 54 patients with JET (incidence = 1.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate logistic regression analysis, low operative weight, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration &gt;100 min, and immediate postoperative serum <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> level &gt;20 mg/dl were associated with increased odds of developing JET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with JET had longer mechanical ventilation time, cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) stay, and hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was only one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in JET group (1.8 %) with no significant difference compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>JET remains a relatively common postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, but it is less frequent than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>JET occurs more commonly in smaller patients with longer CPB runs and significant postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality associated with JET is lower than historically reported, but morbidity remains high </plain></SENT>
