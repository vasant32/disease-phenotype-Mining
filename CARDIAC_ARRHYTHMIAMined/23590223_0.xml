<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, combination therapy using aspirin with a platelet <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (i.e. P2Y12 ) receptor inhibitor, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, prasugrel or, more recently, ticagrelor, has been recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological agents that reversibly inhibit platelet aggregation without metabolic activation in the liver are believed to reduce cardiovascular mortality compared with the current drug of choice for antiplatelet therapy, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings are based on a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Numerous factors are postulated to contribute to the improved survival of patients who take ticagrelor compared with those taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>, including the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> may lead to a much higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although ticagrelor has recently been approved for use in the US and exhibits superiority over other antiplatelet agents, certain concerns remain regarding its use, including lung injury and dyspnoea, thus raising the issue of its true superiority over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> or prasugrel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies into ticagrelor report conflicting data, with certain aspects of its mechanisms of action still not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ticagrelor has beneficial effects following its clinical application, such as achieving overall higher reductions in mortality compared with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and prasugrel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Harmful effects associated with the use of ticagrelor include a higher incidence of dyspnoea and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
