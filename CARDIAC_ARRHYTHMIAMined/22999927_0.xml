<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) and parasympathetic release of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) are controlled by the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and by pre-synaptic inhibition of transmitter release within the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in cardiac sympathetic transmission relative to parasympathetic transmission is pathological as it can lead to disturbances in heart rhythm, catecholaminergic toxicity and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(-/-)) have elevated atrial NE but a low heart rate suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002271'>autonomic dysregulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mice whose sympathetic neurons lack the gp130 cytokine receptor (gp130 KO) have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rate but enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> after vagal nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>What is unclear is whether cardiac autonomic disturbances in these animals reflect systemic alterations in nerve activity or whether localized defects in neurotransmitter stores or release are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To examine local stimulus-evoked release of <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi>, we have developed a novel method for simultaneous quantification of both NE and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> after ex vivo atrial field stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using HPLC with electrochemical detection for NE, and HPLC with mass spectrometry for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, we found that following field stimulation NE release was impaired in p75(-/-) atria while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> content and release was elevated in gp130 KO atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, alterations in localized transmitter release from atrial explants are consistent with in vivo deficits in heart rate control, suggesting peripheral alterations in autonomic transmission in these mice </plain></SENT>
