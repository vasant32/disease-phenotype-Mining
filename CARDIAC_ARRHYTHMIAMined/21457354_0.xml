<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The study aimed to assess electrocardiographic alterations during oral implant placement surgeries under local anesthesia (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> chlorhydrate with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>), using 15 mg of midazolam as an anxiolytic premedication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study randomly selected 20 patients, aged 21-50 years old, requiring bilateral mandibular dental implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was assessed using placebo on one side and midazolam on the contralateral side, with random, double-blinded distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram recorded 12 static leads every 2 min, while D2 derivations were recorded continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between the placebo and midazolam when analyzing the morphological behavior of the electrocardiographic wave and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, under sedation, assessment of the behavior of electrocardiographic parameters during different stages of the procedure revealed statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) for heart rate, P-wave amplitude and duration of the RR and QTc intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> detected were considered low risk for patients without systemic alterations and were observed in 53.3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently occurring alterations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> and blocked atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp>, which were similar for both placebo and midazolam, with the greatest incidence during the initial, incision and bone drilling stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of 15 mg of midazolam made no difference compared with the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of 15 mg of midazolam did not show an advantage in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> The anxiolytic premedication does not prevent myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in endosseous implant placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> may not represent serious risks </plain></SENT>
