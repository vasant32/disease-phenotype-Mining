<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of LAPS are not instantaneous, so there are legitimate welfare concerns around the experience of birds before <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using self-contained telemetry logging units, high-quality continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings were obtained from 28 broiler chickens during exposure to LAPS in a commercial poultry processing plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of LAPS was associated with changes in the EEG pattern in the form of increases in total power, decreases in mean frequency, and in particular, increases in slow-wave (delta) activity, indicating a gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased delta wave activity was seen within 10 s of LAPS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and consistently thereafter, peaking at 30 s into LAPS at which point the EEG signal shared characteristics with that of birds in a surgical plane of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During LAPS, heart rate consistently decreased, with more pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> observed after 30 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No heart rate increases were observed in the period when the birds were potentially conscious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After an initial quiescent period, brief body movements (presumed to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>/loss of posture) were seen on average at 39 s into the LAPS process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Later (after 120 s on average), artifacts related to clonic (wing flapping) and tonic (<z:mp ids='MP_0000743'>muscle spasms</z:mp>) <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> were observed in the EKG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on EEG analysis and body movement responses, a conservative estimate of time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> is approximately 40 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of behavioral responses indicating aversion or escape and absence of heart rate elevation in the conscious period strongly suggest that birds do not find LAPS induction distressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the results suggest that LAPS is a humane approach that has the potential to improve the welfare of poultry at slaughter by gradually inducing unconsciousness without distress, eliminating live shackling and ensuring every bird is adequately stunned before exansguination </plain></SENT>
