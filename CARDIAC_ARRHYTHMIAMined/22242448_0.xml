<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> of mice were induced by Chansu and then electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes of P-R interval, QRS complex, Q-T interval, T wave amplitude, heart rate (HR) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rate, survival rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isolated mouse hearts were prefused, and the lethal dose of Chansu was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, after pretreatment with phenytoin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, broadening of QRS complex and HR were inhibited, and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, the prolongation of P-R interval and broadening of QRS complex were inhibited, and the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, prolongation of P-R interval, broadening of QRS complex, prolongation of Q-T interval and HR were inhibited, and the incidences of both supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, HR was inhibited, the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were reduced dramatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, after pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the prolongation of P-R interval and Q-T interval were inhibited and the incidences of both supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were reduced dramatically; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was reduced significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In in vivo experiments, phenytoin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> was most effective against the mice <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by Chansu while cautious use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> for Chansu inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> should be noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is also concluded that mice <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by Chansu might be most closely related to <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> might be related to beta-adrenergic receptor, and calcium channel plays an important role in conduction block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In in vitro experiments, phenytoin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> was most effective, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> had no obvious effect and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reduced the lethal dose of Chansu </plain></SENT>
