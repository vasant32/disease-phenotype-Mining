<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 Å resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons to previous open-pore <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 Å wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> selectivity through partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> via direct interaction with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> side chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> at the atomic level </plain></SENT>
