<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the severe consequences of undiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and the availability of effective treatment, the potential for prevention in this group is enormous if they do have an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This nationwide prospective population-based cohort study described the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> in relatives of young SCD victims, compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SCD victims aged 1-35 years in Denmark, 2000-2006, were identified (n = 470), along with their first- and second-degree relatives (n = 3073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in those relatives with that in the background population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> over 11 years of follow-up was 292, compared with 219 expected based on national rates [SIR 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.50] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks varied significantly with age; the SIR for those &lt;35 years was 3.53 (95% CI 2.65-4.69), compared with SIRs of 1.59 (95% CI 1.35-1.89) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.75-1.10) for those aged 35-60 years or &gt;60 years, respectively (P(homogeneity) &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For first-degree relatives &lt;35 years, SIRs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were 5.99 (95% CI 1.95-0.13.98), 17.91 (95% CI 4.88-45.87), and 19.15 (95% CI 7.70-39.45), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> co-aggregated significantly with SCD in families, with young first-degree relatives at greatest risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results clearly indicate that family members of young SCD victims should be offered comprehensive and systematic screening, with focus on the youngest relatives </plain></SENT>
