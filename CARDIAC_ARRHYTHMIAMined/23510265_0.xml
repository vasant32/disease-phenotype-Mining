<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES.: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (CM) is an inevitable consequence of Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> in particular, have been proposed to serve as an early marker for CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this concept, we assessed the correlation between R wave height in lead V1 and echocardiographic findings in boys with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS.: Serial echocardiograms and electrocardiograms (n = 800) were performed during each clinic visit in a cohort of 155 boys with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Precordial R wave height in lead V1 was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters included ejection fraction (EF), shortening fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS.: Ages ranged from 1.8 to 37.2 years (mean 14.7 ± 5.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one patients had CM and 318/800 echocardiograms had an EF &lt; 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older patients tended to have a lower EF, but there was no correlation between age and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R wave height in lead V1 correlated poorly with both left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (r = 0.096, P =.0078) and EF (r = 0.096, P =.0088) for the whole cohort as well as those studies demonstrating an EF &lt;55% (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension r = 0.089, P =.12 and EF r = -0.044, P =.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No individual patient demonstrated significant correlation between R wave height in lead V1 and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension or EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension showed a moderate negative correlation with EF for the whole cohort (r = -0.394, P &lt;.001) as well as those with an EF &lt; 55% (r = -0.376, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS.: The precordial R wave height in V1 correlates poorly with the presence of depressed left ventricular function and is not prognostic for the development of CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>While not predictive for CM, the electrocardiogram remains vital to cardiac screening for boys with Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> due to risk for other cardiac manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
