<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group compared the prognostic value of CPX parameters between patients with sinus rhythm (SR) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF).Peak O2 uptake (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>), the ratio of the increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> to the increase in work rate (Δ<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>/ΔWR), and the slope of the increase in ventilation to the increase in <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> output (VE-VCO2 slope) were obtained from CPX in 72 AF patients and 478 SR patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic values of these indices were compared between the two groups.Six cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 25 cardiac events were observed in the AF group and 9 cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 96 cardiac events were observed in the SR group, over a prospective follow-up period of 1,192 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentages of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and cardiac events were higher in the AF group than in the SR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> was identified as a sole significant predictor of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiac events in SR patients and VE-VCO2 slope was identified as a sole significant predictor of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiac events in AF patients.Our results suggest that the VE-VCO2 slope is strongly predictive of future cardiac events in patients with AF and that peak <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> is strongly predictive of future cardiac events in SR patients </plain></SENT>
