<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the effects of these drugs is Na (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>) channel blocking ability causing cardiac complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="32139">Sodium bicarbonate</z:chebi> is used for treatment of these complications which may have some effect on serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering no specific research on Na changes on these patients, the serum Na changes and its correlation with ECG changes, serum pH, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> toxicity severity were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study was done on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-poisoning patients who were admitted in Noor hospital in Esfahan in last 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels, ECG changes, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> severity toxicity of 92 patients were evaluated five times during first 24 h of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were conscious level changes (81.52%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> (64.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on toxicity severity by these symptoms the patients were classified into three groups: 12% of the patients had mild toxicity, 50% moderate, and 38% severe toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in mean serum Na during the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was not found any correlation between serum Na level, and serum pH, ECG, and toxicity severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using <z:chebi fb="17" ids="32139">sodium bicarbonate</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-poisoning cases does not change the serum Na levels significantly </plain></SENT>
