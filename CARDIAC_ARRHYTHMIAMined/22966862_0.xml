<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A multicenter European Registry, SEARCH-MI, was instituted in the year 2002 in order to assess patients' outcomes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions in patients with a previous MI and depressed LV function, treated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> according to MADIT II results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the time elapsed between last <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and prophylactic cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implant on device activations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 643 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (mean LVEF 26 ± 5%) and NYHA class I-III were prospectively followed for 1.8 ± 1.2 years in a multicenter registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The population was divided into 3 groups according to the time between last MI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant: [1] from 40 days to less than 1.5 years; [2] from 1.5 to less than 7 years and [3] at least 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of ventricular tachyarrhymias and appropriate device therapy (ATP or shock) were higher in patients implanted longer time from last MI (Gray's Test p=0.002 and p=0.013 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality (Gray's Test p=0.618) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> across the MI stratification groups (Gray's Test p=0.663) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients implanted with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> longer after the MI have a higher chance of presenting ventricular tachyarrhythmias and appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, while no differences were seen in overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations may be important for improving patient targeting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
