<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the relationship between degrees of G(j) uncoupling and conduction velocity (θ) remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conflicting results in similar experiments are normally attributed to experimental differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that interstitial volume modulates conduction velocity and its dependence on G(j) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interstitial volume (V(IS)) was quantified histologically from guinea pig right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping was used to quantify conduction velocity and anisotropy (AR(θ)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Albumin (4 g/l) decreased histologically assessed V(IS), increased transverse θ by 71 ± 10%, and lowered AR(θ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, albumin did not change isolated cell size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> increased V(IS), decreased transverse θ by 24 ± 4%, and increased AR(θ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> also decreased cell width by 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> was associated with spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> in three of eight animals relative to zero of 15 during control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The θ-G(j) relationship was assessed using the G(j) uncoupler carbenoxolone (CBX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whereas 13 μM CBX did not significantly affect θ during control, it slowed transverse θ by 38 �� 9% during <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest changes in V(IS) modulate θ, AR(θ), and the θ-G(j) relationship and thereby alter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, V(IS) may underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility, particularly in diseases associated with gap junction remodeling </plain></SENT>
