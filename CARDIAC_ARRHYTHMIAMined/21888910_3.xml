<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epicardial monophasic or transmembrane action potentials and contractility were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rat hearts, reperfusion significantly increased the number of premature beats (PBs) relative to pre-ischemic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This arrhythmic pattern was associated with a significant increase in CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Ser2814 on Ca(2+)-release channels (RyR2) and Thr17 on phospholamban (PLN) at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These phenomena could be prevented by the CaMKII-inhibitor KN-93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In transgenic mice with targeted inhibition of CaMKII at the SR membranes (SR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>), PBs were significantly decreased from 31±6 to 5±1 beats/3min with a virtually complete disappearance of early-afterdepolarizations (EADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In mice with genetic mutation of the CaMKII phosphorylation site on RyR2 (RyR2-S2814A), PBs decreased by 51.0±14.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the number of PBs upon reperfusion did not change in transgenic mice with ablation of both PLN phosphorylation sites (PLN-DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The experiments in SR-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> mice, in which the CaMKII inhibitor <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> is anchored in the SR membrane but also inhibits CaMKII regulation of L-type Ca(2+) channels, indicated a critical role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SR proteins and/or L-type Ca(2+) channels in reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The experiments in RyR2-S2814A further indicate that up to 60% of PBs related to CaMKII are dependent on the phosphorylation of RyR2-Ser2814 site and could be ascribed to delayed-afterdepolarizations (DADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, phosphorylation of PLN-Thr17 and L-type Ca(2+) channels might contribute to reperfusion-induced PBs, by increasing SR Ca(2+) content and Ca(2+) influx </plain></SENT>
