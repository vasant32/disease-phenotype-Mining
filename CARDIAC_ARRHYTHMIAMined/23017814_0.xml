<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing (ATP) and shock delivery may induce or accelerate tachyarrhythmias in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the incidence, triggers and impact on mortality of accelerated ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Database analysis concerning ventricular tachyarrhythmias accelerated by ATP or shock in 1275 ICD patients (age at implantation 59.7±14.0years; 81% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within a mean follow-up period of 5.3±4.0years, intracardiac electrograms were available in 1170 patients (91.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 157 episodes of accelerated ventricular tachyarrhythmias were found in 100 of 1170 patients (8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Termination of tachyarrhythmias was achieved by shock delivery in 153 episodes (96.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triggers of accelerated tachyarrhythmias were appropriate ATP in 139 (88.5%) and inappropriate ATP in 14 (8.9%), as well as appropriate and inappropriate shocks in 2 (1.3%) episodes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with the occurrence and recurrence of acceleration (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with accelerated ventricular tachyarrhythmia and subsequent shock therapy revealed higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (HR 1.760; 95% CI 1.286-2.410; p&lt;0.001) as well as higher cardiac mortality (HR 2.555; 95% CI 1.446-4.513; p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation between acceleration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was independent of left ventricular function (HR 2.076; 95% CI 1.633-2.639; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular ATP with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> acceleration and subsequent shock delivery is a frequent and serious complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy that predominantly occurs in patients with reduced left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, occurrence of accelerated ventricular tachyarrhythmias was associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
