<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its slow activation is critically important for membrane repolarization and for abbreviating the cardiac action potential, especially during sympathetic activation and at high heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in either gene can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, which can lead to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand better the elementary behavior of this slowly activating channel complex, we quantitatively analyzed direct measurements of single-channel IKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-channel recordings from transiently transfected mouse ltk(-) cells confirm a channel that has long latency periods to opening (1.67 ± 0.073 s at +60 mV) but that flickers rapidly between multiple open and closed states in non-deactivating bursts at positive membrane potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Channel activity is cyclic with periods of high activity followed by quiescence, leading to an overall open probability of only ∼0.15 after 4 s under our recording conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean single-channel conductance was determined to be 3.2 pS, but unlike any other known <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel, long-lived subconductance levels coupled to activation are a key feature of both the activation and deactivation time courses of the conducting channel complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Up to five conducting levels ranging from 0.13 to 0.66 pA could be identified in single-channel recordings at 60 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fast closings and overt subconductance behavior of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> IKs channel required modification of existing Markov models to include these features of channel behavior </plain></SENT>
