<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent years, Staphylococcus epidermidis ( Se) has become a major nosocomial pathogen and the most common cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of implanted prostheses and other indwelling devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due in part to <z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi> biofilm formation by Se on device surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it still remains unknown that how the process of Se biofilm development is associated with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have identified clinical Se isolates displaying enhanced biofilm dispersal and self-renewal relative to reference strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These isolates also exhibit enhanced initial cell attachment, extracellular DNA release, cell autolysis and thicker microcolonies during biofilm development relative to reference strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our genetic analyses suggest that these clinical isolates exhibit significant downregulation of RNAIII, the effector molecule of the agr quorum sensing system, and upregulation of the autolysin gene atlE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isogenic deletion of the agr system in Se 1457 confirmed that agr negatively regulating atlE resulted in enhanced initial cell attachment, extracellular DNA release, cell autolysis and biofilm formation abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, double deletion of agr and atlE significantly abolished these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data reveal the role of agr system in long-term biofilm development and pathogenesis during Se caused indwelling devices-related relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
