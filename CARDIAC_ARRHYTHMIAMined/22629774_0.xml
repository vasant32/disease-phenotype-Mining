<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients were studied: in group 1 (n = 78) patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> taking constantly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for rhythm control were included, group 2 (n = 67) consisted of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> taking propafenon, ethacizine and digoxin for rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In studied groups liver transaminase activity and data of liver echography after 90 +/- 8 days of treatment were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 51.58% patients of group 1 asymptomatic increase of liver transaminase activity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If liver transaminase activity had been raised before taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, frequency and degree of liver transaminase increase extended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, patients taking constantly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, require dynamic control of GGTP, AIAT, AsAT once a quarter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If liver transaminase activity increases because of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> taking the method of treatment is possible to be changed and rate control therapy may be chosen </plain></SENT>
