<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that activation of ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channels can attenuate sympathetic hyperinnervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, has been shown to provide a preconditioning-like cardioprotective effect via opening of K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of sildenafil attenuates cardiac sympathetic hyperinnervation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> through activation of K(ATP) channels and to compare it with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar infarcted rats induced by ligation of the anterior descending artery were randomized to either vehicle, nicorandil, sildenafil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, or a combination of nicorandil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, or sildenafil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels revealed a significant elevation in vehicle-treated rats compared with sham-operated rats, consistent with sympathetic hyperinnervation after infarction assessed by immunohistochemical analysis for tyrosine hydroxylase, growth associated factor 43 and neurofilament and by protein expression and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of nerve growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic hyperinnervation was reduced after administering either nicorandil or sildenafil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in the sildenafil-treated rats were significantly lower than those treated with the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the beneficial effects of sildenafil-induced were reversed by the addition of either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or 5-hydroxydecanoate, implicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> K(ATP) channels as the relevant target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">Isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi> failed to confer similar antiarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="29300">1H-</z:chebi>[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-Î±]quinoxalin-1-one, a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, did not influence the effect of sildenafil on the nerve growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that sildenafil after infarction attenuated sympathetic hyperinnervation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> by activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> K(ATP) channels through a guanylyl cyclase-cGMP-independent pathway </plain></SENT>
