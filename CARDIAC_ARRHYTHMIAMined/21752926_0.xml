<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine how the anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin impact on postoperative complications in children undergoing the Fontan procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients between 14 months and 18 years (n=56) undergoing a Fontan operation at our institution between January 2005 and June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group (n=29) included patients from January 2005 through December 2007 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom received aprotinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group (n=27) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from January 2008 through June 2009 who did not receive aprotinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medical records and collected preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duration and volume of chest tube drainage were the primary outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 20% of patients who had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated only aprotinin was associated with significantly decreased postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal function and fenestration or Fontan <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> did not differ significantly; there was no statistically significant difference in volume or duration of chest tube drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median duration of chest tube drainage was 7 days in the aprotinin group and 8 days for patients who did not receive aprotinin (P=0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin may be protective against postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aprotinin does not confer increased risks of prolonged chest tube drainage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure </plain></SENT>
