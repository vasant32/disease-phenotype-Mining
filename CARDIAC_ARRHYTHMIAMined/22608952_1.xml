<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been recent evidence to suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> may not have a favorable safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We decided to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available evidence on the cardiovascular safety of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A systematic search was made of the PubMed, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials from 1966 through 2011 comparing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> to comparators in AF/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> for AF for some studies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> for others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparators included standard medical therapy and/or placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for 1 study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcomes assessed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, embolic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> exacerbations, and hospitalization rates in the intervention versus comparator group at the end of â‰¥ 3 months of follow up with abstraction of data by 1 author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven randomized controlled trials were included in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> use was associated with a trend toward worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also showed numerically higher event rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other outcome events except <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our pooled analysis showed increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> exacerbations with use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> across a wide spectrum of populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we recommend exercising caution using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi>, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
