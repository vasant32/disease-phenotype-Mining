<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fatal VA also occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and ischemic-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the suppressive effect of K201 (JTV519), a multiple-channel blocker and cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) stabilizer, with that of diltiazem, a Ca(2+ )channel blocker, in 2 studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced (n = 30) and ischemic-reperfusion-induced VAs (n = 38) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were administered 12 mg/kg/min <z:chebi fb="26" ids="3312">calcium chloride</z:chebi> (CaCl(2)) for 20 minutes and then 6 Î¼g/kg/min <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> was infused with CaCl(2) for a further 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other rats, the left coronary artery was ligated for 5 minutes followed by reperfusion for 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>K201 or diltiazem (both 1 mg/kg) was administered before infusion of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> or induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and mortality (2 of 10, 20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significance: Induction of VA in an experimental model was achieved with a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> under Ca(2+) loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>K201 markedly suppressed both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced and the reperfusion-induced VAs, whereas diltiazem did not suppress the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that both VAs are related to early after depolarization (EAD) and indicate that K201 has the potential to suppress EAD by stabilizing RyR2 to mediate Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and acting as a multiple-channel blocker </plain></SENT>
