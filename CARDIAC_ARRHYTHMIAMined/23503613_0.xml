<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> therapy shows its unique potential for reducing mortality in animal study and improving neurologic outcome in patients with traumatic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> for pediatric traumatic brain injury remains a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effectiveness and safety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment for pediatric traumatic brain injury patients, we conducted this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data from MEDLINE, Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library by electronic searching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No limitation of language was selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We extracted the mortality and adverse events from the published trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six clinical trials and 366 pediatric patients met our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> had more unfavorable outcome than those in the normothermia group (RR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.06 to 2.84), and this increased risk is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> are slightly likely to be induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and the likelihood is also significant (RR 2.57, 95 % CI 1.01 to 6.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> has no statistical difference between normothermia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> arms (RR 0.90, 95 % CI 0.73 to 1.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the included trials have reported their detail randomization assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> may slightly increase the risk of mortality in children with traumatic brain injury and the ratio of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> after this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> therapy is slightly higher than that in normothermia groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the future, more randomized controlled trials and multicenter studies on the mechanism of therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> are required </plain></SENT>
