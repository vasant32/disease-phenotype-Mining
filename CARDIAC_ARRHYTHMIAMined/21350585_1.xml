<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy was not widely accepted, and many physicians actually considered this therapy unethical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large secondary and primary prevention trials, demonstrating a beneficial effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in selected patients not only on arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> but also on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, stimulated a rapid growth in the number of implants and increased patient's and physician's acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvements in size and weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> discrimination capabilities, battery technology, shock waveform and output, monitoring capabilities and defibrillator electrode technology eventually resulted in the current large number of yearly implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Today, almost 40 years after the conception of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and 25 years after the first human implant, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is the treatment of choice for patients at risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> either as secondary or primary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, with the more recent addition of resynchronisation therapy to standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, it became possible to treat selected patients with advanced symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and to lower the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
