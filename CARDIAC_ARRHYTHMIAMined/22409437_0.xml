<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sexual intercourse is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> development, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether this increased risk is due to physical exertion alone or whether it is an inherent aspect of sexual activity itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a telemetric approach, we show that sexual activity is associated with transient (8-14 s) but profound increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA; up to 22-fold that of baseline) in both male and female rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This increase was significantly greater than that observed during physical exertion (three- to sixfold increase in RSNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed rapid transitions in male rabbits from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (422 ± 21 b.p.m.; P &lt; 0.01) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (186 ± 28 b.p.m.; P &lt; 0.05) during and immediately following coitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests simultaneous activation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study provides the first real-time insight into the extreme variation in neural and cardiovascular function occurring during sexual activity in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Little is known about how the physiological responses to sexual activity may change under disease or drug-treatment states, and these findings may prove of use to these areas in future </plain></SENT>
