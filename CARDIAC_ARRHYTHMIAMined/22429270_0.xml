<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of long-term nonsystemic ventricular pacing on cardiac function, dyssynchrony, and clinical performance in patients with systemic RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-six adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and atrial redirection, of whom 11 were permanently paced at the nonsystemic ventricle, underwent assessment of clinical status and exercise stress testing, as well as echocardiography to assess parameters of RV function and dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In paced patients, median NYHA functional class was II, which was significantly higher than in nonpaced patients (median class I; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum performance and peak oxygen consumption on exercise testing were significantly lower in paced patients when compared with nonpaced patients (100 ± 30 vs 120 ± 32 W and 22 ± 6 vs 27 ± 7 mLO(2)/kg/min, respectively; P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On echocardiography, RV shortening fraction (27 ± 11 vs 33 ± 10%), RV ejection fraction (39 ± 7 vs 44 ± 10%) and RV dP/dt(max) (891 ± 470 vs 1,024 ± 318 mmHg/s) were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) in paced versus nonpaced patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraventricular dyssynchrony was most pronounced in the paced group (99 ± 10 vs 25 ± 9 ms and 70 ± 29 vs 21 ± 15 ms, respectively; P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term pacing of the nonsystemic ventricle in patients with atrial switch for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> was associated with significantly impaired functional status, exercise capacity, and systemic ventricular function </plain></SENT>
