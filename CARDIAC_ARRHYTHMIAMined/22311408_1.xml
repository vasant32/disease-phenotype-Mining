<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 30 rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, I/R group, and DXR-pretreated I/R (DXR-I/R) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats in the DXR-DXRI/R group were intragastrically administrated with DXR (12.5 g/kg per day) for consecutive 7 days, while rats I/in the sham and I/R groups were administrated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were introduced by I/R and electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional (2-D) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and matrix-matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were used to identify assisted differentially expressed proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RQPCR), Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to analyze proteins PCR), obtained in the above experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DXR significantly reduced the incidence and mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and dramatically decreased the mortality, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score, compared with those of the I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among successfully identified proteins, prohibitin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi>) and heart fatty acid binding protein (hFABP) were up-regulated in DXR-pretreated I/R rats compared with those of the I/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared with the I/R group, the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) was elevated accompanied by reduced expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and neutrophil infiltration in I/R rats with DXR pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DXR could alleviate I/R-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which might be related to increased expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The enhanced expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi> prevented against the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of GSH and consequently inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53388">PHB</z:chebi> might ameliorate I/R-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and leakage of hFABP by suppressing neutrophil infiltration and IL-6 expressions </plain></SENT>
