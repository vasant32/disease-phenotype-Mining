<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is well known that music may not only improve quality of life but also effect changes in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactions to music are considered subjective, but studies suggest that cardio/cerebrovascular variables are influenced under different circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that cerebral flow was significantly lower when listening to "Va pensioero" from Verdi's "Nabucco" (70.4+3.3 cm/s) compared to "Libiam nei lieti calici" from Verdi's "La Traviata" (70.2+3.1 cm/s) (P&lt;0,02) or Bach's Cantata No. 169 "Gott soll allein mein Herze haben" (70.9+2.9 cm/s) (P&lt;0,02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant influence on cerebral flow in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony during rest (67.6+3.3 cm/s) or music (69.4+3.1 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was reported that relaxing music plays an important role in intensive care medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Music significantly decreases the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> for patients in a preoperative setting (STAI-X-1 score 34) to a greater extent even than orally administered midazolam (STAI-X-1 score 36) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the score was better after surgery in the music group (STAI-X-1 score 30) compared to midazolam (STAI-X-1 score 34) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher effectiveness and absence of apparent adverse effects make relaxing, preoperative music a useful alternative to midazolam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is sufficient practical evidence of stress reduction suggesting that a proposed regimen of listening to music while resting in bed after open-heart surgery is important in clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 30 min of bed rest, there was a significant difference in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels between the music (484.4 mmol/l) and the non-music group (618.8 mmol/l) (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vocal and orchestral music produces significantly better correlations between cardiovascular and respiratory signals in contrast to uniform emphasis (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most benefit on health in intensive care medicine patients is visible in classical (Bach, Mozart or Italian composers) music and meditation music, whereas heavy metal music or techno are not only ineffective but possibly dangerous and can lead to stress and/or life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, particularly in intensive care medicine patients </plain></SENT>
