<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the incidence and clinical impact of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 5-year, prospective study, we assessed the incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> as well as risk factors, clinical consequences, management, and impact on survival in patients with pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi>, n=157) or inoperable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> thromboembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (CTEPH, n=82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative 5-year incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> was 25.1% (95% confidence interval, 13.8-35.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was frequently accompanied by clinical worsening (80%) and signs of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stable sinus rhythm was successfully re-established in 21/24 (88%) of patients initially presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and in 16/24 (67%) of patients initially presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> were an independent risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p=0.04, simple Cox regression analysis) with a higher mortality in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> when compared to patients in whom sinus rhythm was restored (estimated survival at 1, 2 and 3years 64%, 55%, and 27% versus 97%, 80%, and 57%, respectively; p=0.01, log rank analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>Atrial flutter</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> develop in a sizable number of patients with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> or inoperable CTEPH and often lead to clinical deterioration and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality is high when sinus rhythm cannot be restored </plain></SENT>
