<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The birds were anesthetized by face mask with ISO for brachial artery catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After recovery, anesthesia was re-induced and maintained with ISO with spontaneous ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography, direct systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial blood pressure (DAP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal carbon dioxide (P(ET)<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>), and cloacal temperature (T degrees C) were measured before induction (baseline, under physical restraint) and after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 min of ISO anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood samples were collected for blood gas analysis at baseline, 10, 25, and 40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RR, SAP, DAP, MAP, T degrees C and pH decreased from baseline values, whereas arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, bicarbonate concentration, and P(ET)<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were significantly higher than baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>Apnea</z:hpo> was not observed in any bird </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ISO anesthesia is suitable for use in healthy members of this species despite the moderate cardiovascular and respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> produced </plain></SENT>
