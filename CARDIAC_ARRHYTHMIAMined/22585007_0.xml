<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the influence of female gender on coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery from our own experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected database from a single centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to gender and potential differences in pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative factors were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant high-risk factors were then fitted in a multivariate model to account for differences in predicting gender influence on surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred and four consecutive patients underwent isolated first-time CABG between February 2000 and December 2008; 562 (20%) patients were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively, females were more likely to have significant comorbidities (age, congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, pre-op <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, small body surface area and poor ejection fraction (p &lt; 0.001)) consistent with higher Euroscore (p &gt; 0.0001) and more urgent surgery (p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra-operatively, they showed less extent pattern of disease requiring less bypass and cross-clamp time (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Observed surgical mortality was significantly higher in females (3.6 vs. 2.1%, p &lt; 0.042); however, after adjusting for propensity score and significant factors identified in multivariate models, females only independently predicted a higher wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, lower neurological complications, lower rate of re-sternotomy, longer hospital stay and post-surgery stay (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher risk profile and higher observed surgical mortality, early outcomes in females were similar to their matched males' counterpart in isolated CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Females were associated with higher incidence of wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> but lower rate of neurological complications </plain></SENT>
