<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Charts of patients undergoing UPPP at an academic teaching hospital from 1999 to 2005 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 345 consecutive patients (248 inpatients; 97 outpatients) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common post-operative complication in the entire study was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> desaturation (12.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients suffered major complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding complications limited to the post-<z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> care unit alone, only 8.2% of patients had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> desaturation after discontinuation of oxygen supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inpatients requiring supplemental oxygen on the ward had significantly higher mean AHI (37.4 vs. 31.4; p=0.05) and BMI (32.3 kg/m2 vs. 28.9 kg/m2; p=0.004) than those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those inpatients who were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) with an AHIâ‰¥22 were associated with an increased risk of requiring oxygen on the ward (odds ratio = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.56 - 7.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-UPPP complications is much lower than the literature has historically suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Selected patients should be able to safely undergo outpatient UPPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher AHI, higher BMI, or multiple comorbidities are at higher risk for postoperative complications and are most appropriate for overnight monitoring </plain></SENT>
