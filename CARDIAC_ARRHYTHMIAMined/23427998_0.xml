<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study assessed ablation techniques, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, long-term outcomes, and complications of catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients 65 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients aged &lt; 65 years (n = 653) vs 65 years (n = 213), who underwent catheter ablation of AF in the course of eight years, were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ablation strategy and procedure endpoints were left at the operators discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group of patients 65 years comprised more females (p &lt; 0.001), and more frequently presented with persistent AF (p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients less frequently underwent simple pulmonary vein isolation (p = 0.017); on the contrary, extensive ablation including coronary sinus intervention was more common (p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in repeat ablation procedures (25 % vs 26 % patients; p = 0.823, or 1.4 vs 1.5 ablation procedures/1 patients; p = 0.479, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectrum of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> did not differ between the groups except for more frequent paroxysmal AF before the first repeat ablation in patients &lt; 65 years (p = 0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of 49 Â± 26 month total follow-up, stable sinus rhythm (SR) was achieved in 85 % patients &lt; 65 years vs 76 % patients 65 years (p = 0.318) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To maintain stable SR, older patients more often continued to take antiarrhythmic medication (p = 0.054) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More serious complication occurred in 3.8 % of the patients 65 years vs 2.1 % of the patients &lt; 65 years of age (p = 0.207) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients 65 years of age achieved insignificantly worse long-term outcome after insignificantly fewer repeat ablation procedures, and with more frequent use of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SR maintenance and risk of complications were, however, favorable </plain></SENT>
