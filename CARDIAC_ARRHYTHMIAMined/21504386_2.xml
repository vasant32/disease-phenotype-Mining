<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This editorial discusses the safety evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> with a focus on the risk of the potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exact incidence of antipsychotic-induced TdP remains unknown because capturing TdP warrants continuous monitoring and tens of thousands of patient-years due to the rarity of TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this reason, surrogate markers such as the QTc interval are used despite their limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New surrogate markers Tpeak-Tend and T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> have seen the light of day but their validity remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large pragmatic trials have been conducted, but their contributions to drug safety evaluations are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, psychiatrists should have in mind that safety evaluation should include more than the risk of TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> are associated with life-shortening side effects, such as severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, which may contribute more to the overall mortality than TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to this, suboptimal treatment may result in life-shortening behaviors such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A shared decision including a thorough discussion of risks and benefits with the patients is essential </plain></SENT>
