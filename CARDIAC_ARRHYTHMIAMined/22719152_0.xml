<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation can include <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present what we believe is the first reported case of asymptomatic iatrogenic left main coronary ostial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was an active 34-year-old man who had undergone a modified Bentall procedure and was asymptomatic thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven months after that operation, exercise stress testing showed electrocardiographic signs of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> at high workload, and coronary angiography revealed severe nonatherosclerotic left main ostial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting of the unprotected left main stenosis was successful, and patency at 8 months was apparent on coronary angiography.The conventional treatment for coronary ostial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stenosis, coronary artery</z:e> bypass grafting, carries a high risk of perioperative infarction, morbidity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting yielded positive short- and long-term results and may provide an alternative to cardiac surgery in these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend that physicians evaluate even asymptomatic patients for left main coronary ostial stenosis after aortic surgery so that early diagnosis and treatment can avert severe clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
