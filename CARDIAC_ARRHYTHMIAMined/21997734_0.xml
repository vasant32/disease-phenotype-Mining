<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to these toxic effects are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, proteomic analysis has been performed to investigate the protein patterns that are differentially expressed in liver of rainbow trout exposed to sublethal concentrations of VRP (0.5, 27.0, and 270 μg/liter) for 42 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was employed to detect and identify the protein profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that the expression of six hepatic acidic proteins were markedly altered in the treatment groups compared with the control group; three proteins especially were significantly down-regulated in fish exposed to VRP at environmental related concentration (0.5 μg/liter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the VRP induce mechanisms against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 and 94 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi>-isomerase A3) and adaptive changes in ion transference regulation (calreticulin, hyperosmotic glycine-rich protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, for the first time, protein Canopy-1 was found to be significantly down-regulated in fish by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to VRP at environmental related levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, our work supports that fish hepatic proteomics analysis serves as an in vivo model for monitoring the residual pharmaceuticals in aquatic environment and can provide valuable insight into the molecular events in VRP-induced toxicity in fish and other organisms </plain></SENT>
