<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following is an unusual case of elevated DFT despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attempts of invasive and noninvasive approaches--it highlights the importance of performing DFT testing particularly when implantable cardioverter defibrillator is indicated for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and the need for devices capable of delivering higher energies &gt;35 J </plain></SENT>
