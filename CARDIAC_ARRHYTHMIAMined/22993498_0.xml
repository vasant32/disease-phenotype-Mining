<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Performing exercise tests in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) presents specific challenges because of susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during maximal levels of exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to outline the exercise testing protocol from the Anti-Arrhythmic Effects of Exercise after an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> trial and to report baseline test results and safety outcomes using the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed to assess levels of physical fitness as part of a randomized trial of walking exercise in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized after baseline testing to aerobic exercise plus usual care or usual care alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A modified Balke treadmill exercise test was used and specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> programming procedures were implemented to avoid unnecessary shocks, which included programming off <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) therapies during testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, 161 baseline tests have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> occurred following completion of an exercise test and three tests were stopped by the investigators due to nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven subjects were not able to achieve maximum exercise, defined as reaching an anaerobic threshold (AT) at baseline testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There have been no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> as a result of exercise testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptom-limited maximal exercise testing can be performed safely and effectively in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for both primary and secondary prevention indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> programming and preparation for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> needs to be in place before exercise testing is performed </plain></SENT>
