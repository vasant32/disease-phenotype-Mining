<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dantrolene, a therapeutic agent used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002047'>malignant hyperthermia</z:hpo> associated with mutations of the skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), has recently been suggested to have effects on the cardiac type 2 RyR (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that dantrolene exerts antiarrhythmic and inotropic effects on HF ventricular myocytes by examining multiple aspects of intracellular Ca(2+) handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit myocytes, dantrolene (1 Î¼M) had no effect on SR Ca(2+) load, postrest decay of SR Ca(2+) content, the threshold for spontaneous Ca(2+) wave initiation (i.e., the SR Ca(2+) content at which spontaneous waves initiate) and Ca(2+) spark frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cardiomyocytes from failing rabbit hearts, SR Ca(2+) load and the wave initiation threshold were decreased compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocytes, Ca(2+) spark frequency was increased, and the postrest decay was potentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a novel approach of measuring cytosolic and intra-SR Ca(2+) concentration (using the low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51105">fluo-5N</z:chebi> entrapped within the SR), we showed that treatment of HF cardiomyocytes with dantrolene rescued postrest decay and increased the wave initiation threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, dantrolene decreased Ca(2+) spark frequency while increasing the SR Ca(2+) content in HF myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that dantrolene exerts antiarrhythmic effects and preserves inotropy in HF cardiomyocytes by decreasing the incidence of diastolic Ca(2+) sparks, increasing the intra-SR Ca(2+) threshold at which spontaneous Ca(2+) waves occur, and decreasing the loss of Ca(2+) from the SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the observation that dantrolene reduces arrhythmogenicity while at the same time preserves inotropy suggests that dantrolene is a potentially useful drug in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with HF </plain></SENT>
