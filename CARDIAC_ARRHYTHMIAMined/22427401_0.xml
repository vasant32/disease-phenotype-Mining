<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In October 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on the label of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31980">perflutren</z:chebi>-based agents <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31980">Definity</z:chebi> and Optison, contraindicating their use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e>) and unstable cardiopulmonary status, after serious cardiopulmonary reactions occurred in temporal relation to EC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2008 and 2011, the FDA revised the black box warning allowing their use in this same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, limited data exist regarding the safety profile of these agents in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive hospitalized patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e> who were referred for echocardiographic evaluation, but required the use of EC, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> our patients received the EC agent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31980">Definity</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated these patients for serious adverse events (respiratory decompensation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, anaphylactic reactions, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) occurring within 24 h of EC administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study group included 1513 patients (age 69 ± 14 years, 55% males, BMI 33 ± 9 kg/m(2)), of which 911 (60%) had mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e>, 515 (34%) had moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e>, and 87 (6%) had severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean pulmonary artery systolic pressures (PASP) in the groups with mild, moderate, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e> were 41 ± 4 (range 35-49) mmHg, 55 ± 5 (range 50-69) mmHg, and 78 ± 9 (range 70-122) mmHg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups was rare (0.002%) and they were not attributed to EC because of temporal and clinical considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of the EC agent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31980">Definity</z:chebi> is safe in hospitalized patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PHT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
