<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) triggers are critical in the mechanism of AF, but little is known of the substrate changes that occur within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> with ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we sought to identify whether ageing is associated with electroanatomic changes within the pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-five patients undergoing ablation for left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> had high-density 3D electroanatomic maps of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 aged &lt;50 years and group 2 aged &gt;50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean-voltage (MV), % low-voltage (LV &lt; 0.5 mV), conduction, signal complexity, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> muscle sleeve length and diameter were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age was 33 ± 8 vs. 66 ± 8 years for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 2 demonstrated: (i) lower MV within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (1.66 ± 1.1 vs. 1.88 ± 1.1 mV, P &lt; 0.001); (ii) increased % LV (5.0 vs. 1.1%, P &lt; 0.001), and increased voltage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (65 ± 14 vs. 55 ± 8%, P &lt; 0.05); (iii) regional and global conduction slowing in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>; and (iv) increased % complex signals within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (1.4 vs. 0.4%, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeve length or diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increasing age is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> electroanatomic changes characterized by a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> voltage, conduction slowing, and increasing signal complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations provide new insights into the potential mechanisms behind the increased prevalence of AF with advancing age </plain></SENT>
