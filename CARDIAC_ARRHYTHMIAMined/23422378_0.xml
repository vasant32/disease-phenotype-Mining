<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, cardiovascular (CV), and cerebrovascular events during RIS or Pali treatment was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment emergent CV adverse events were identified using 7 prespecified Standardised MedDRA Queries as follows: embolic/thrombotic events, cerebrovascular disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, torsades/QT prolongation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk in the RIS/Pali pooled group was significantly increased compared to placebo for the following adverse events: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> peripheral, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to CV events was low and similar across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the known pharmacologic profile and product information, this analysis of treatment emergent adverse event data from a large, randomized, controlled clinical trials database described increased risk versus placebo for several specific CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from events described in existing product labeling, no new safety findings emerged </plain></SENT>
