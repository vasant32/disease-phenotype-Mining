<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case initially diagnosed as rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, based on 12-lead surface ECG (especially the limb leads) and monitor tracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was resistant to beta blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the at times apparently regular rhythm, an esophageal ECG recording was performed, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> terminated after <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> pentothal was administered while preparing for electrical cardioversion, the oesophageal ECG recordings and the ECGs during <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> administration were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An ECG artefact diagnosis was suspected, and then confirmed, during relapse of the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>," with simple palpation of the radial pulse and cardiac auscultation </plain></SENT>
