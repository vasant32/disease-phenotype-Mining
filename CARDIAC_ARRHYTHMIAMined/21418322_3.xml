<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few reported studies describe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values from 24-hour ECG (Holter) recordings of small breed dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate influence of breed, age, sex, body weight, degree of recording artifact, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP) on Holter recordings of 3 breeds of small dogs that have differing predispositions for myxomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study also assessed if heart rate (HR) at clinical examination (HRex) was associated with HR during Holter monitoring and evaluated the reproducibility of Holter variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Fifty clinically healthy, privately owned dogs of the breeds Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS), Wire-haired Dachshund (wD), or Cairn Terrier (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dogs were recruited for clinical examination, echocardiography, and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 CKCS, Holter recordings were performed twice with a 7-day interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis (time and frequency domain analysis) were performed on Holter recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen out of 27 Holter derived variables were significantly associated with breed (P &lt; .03), but not with age (P &gt; .7), sex (P &gt; .2), body weight (P &gt; .7), degree of recording artifact (P &gt; .4), or MVP (P &gt; .6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During Holter recording, minimum (P = .0001) and mean HR (P = .0001) were higher in CKCS compared with wD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CKCS had significantly lower values than wD, CT, or both in 10 out of 13 HRV variables (P &lt; .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Minimum and mean HR during Holter recording were correlated with HRex (r = 0.55, P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HR and time domain variables had a coefficient of variation &lt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There is an influence of breed on Holter-derived variables in 3 breeds of small dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and HRV analysis can be performed on 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> analysis includes HR measurements and identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
