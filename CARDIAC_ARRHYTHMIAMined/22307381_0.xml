<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fulminant MC is sometimes fatal, and sequelae may develop during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a nationwide survey to determine the clinico-epidemiological features of MC in Japanese children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Survey questionnaires were mailed to 627 hospitals, which were asked if they had treated MC patients aged between 1 month and 17 years during the period from January 1997 through December 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses were collected until December 2005, and data were collected and analyzed until January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 169 patients were reported: 64 fulminant cases, 89 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases, and 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence was 43.5 cases/year and 0.26 cases/100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathogens were identified in 37 patients; coxsackie virus accounted for 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major cardiovascular manifestations at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 70, 37, and 17 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered to 73 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mechanical support seemed to be effective and life-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 169 patients, 123 survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular sequelae were reported in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The survival rate for children with fulminant MC was disappointing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall, two-thirds of survivors had no sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mechanical support may reduce the mortality and the risk of clinical worsening </plain></SENT>
