<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition he had macrohematuria, the further medical history was inconspicuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pain showed to be resistant to therapy, therefore we performed a CT scan of the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT scan showed a partial embolism of the right renal artery, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of the aorta thoracica as well as partial infarction of the spleen and the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An immediately initiated therapy with implantation of an aortal stent graft for fixation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and an ActilyseÂ® therapy led to full recovery of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Closer questioning of the patient showed that the patient undertook an extended abdominal and thoracic muscle training programme by letting an eight-kilogram bowling ball fall down onto his abdomen from about 80 cm height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis embolism of the renal artery cannot be made without extended diagnostics in the emergency room </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initiation of an adequate diagnosis and therapy is essential as otherwise persisting perfusion disorders of the kidney may occur </plain></SENT>
