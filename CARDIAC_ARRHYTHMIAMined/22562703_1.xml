<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we tested the hypothesis that gender-dependent function of the post-depolarization 'late' <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (I(Na-L)) contributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were conducted in mice in which the canonical cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel Scn5a locus was disrupted, and expression of human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> SCN5A cDNA substituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline QT intervals were similar in male and female mice, but exposure to the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel opener anemone toxin ATX-II elicited polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 0/9 males vs. 6/9 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ventricular I(Na-L) and action potential durations were increased in myocytes isolated from female mice compared with those from males before and especially after treatment with ATX-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, ATX-II elicited potentially arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations in myocytes from 0/5 male mice and 3/5 female mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data identify variable late I(Na) as a modulator of gender-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
