<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualize locations of both the ablation scar on the left atrium (LA) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation and epicardial fat pads (FPs) containing ganglionated plexi (GP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 60 patients who underwent pulmonary vein antrum (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi>) isolation along with LA posterior wall and septal debulking for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FPs around the LA surface in well-known GP areas (which were considered as the substitution of GP areas around the LA) were segmented from the dark-blood MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the FP and the ablation scar image visualized by late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE)-MRI on the LA were merged together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overlapping areas of FP and the ablation scar image were considered as the ablated FP areas containing GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring after ablation for the analysis of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ablated FP area was significantly wider in patients without AF recurrence than those in patients with recurrence (5.6 ± 3.1 cm(2) vs 4.2 ± 2.7 cm(2) , P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean values of both percentage of differences greater than 50 ms in the RR intervals (pRR &gt; 50) and standard deviation of RR intervals over the entire analyzed period (SDNN), which were obtained from 24-hour Holter monitoring 1-day post-AF ablation, were significantly lower in patients without recurrence than those in patients with recurrence (5.8 ± 6.0% vs 14.0 ± 10.1%; P = 0.0005, 78.7 ± 32.4 ms vs 109.2 ± 43.5 ms; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between SDNN and the percentage of ablated FP area (Y = -1.3168X + 118.96, R(2) = 0.1576, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extensively ablating LA covering GP areas along with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="53706">PVA</z:chebi> isolation enhanced the denervation of autonomic nerve system and seemed to improve procedural outcome in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
