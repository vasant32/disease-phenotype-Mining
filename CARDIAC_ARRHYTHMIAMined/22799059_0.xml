<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, clinical features and real-life management of AF in ambulatory consultant cardiology clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied consecutive new patients with a diagnosis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recorded data included demographics, comorbidities and prescribed drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic therapy was chosen according to CHADS2 score in non-rheumatic valve AF patients; for AF patients with rheumatic valve disease <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treatment was prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with data of patients without AF admitted to the ambulatory cardiology clinics during the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 865 patients whose mean age was 64.9 +/- 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF was reported in 137 patients (15.8%); 81 were women (59%) and the mean age was 74.4 +/- 7.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heart rate rhythm-control strategy was applied in 41 patients (45%) and rate control in 50 patients (55%) with paroxysmal or persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rate-control strategy was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most patients AF was associated with one or more concomitant comorbidities, most frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was prescribed in 98 patients with AF (71.5%), aspirin in 57 patients with AF (41.6%), and both drugs in 18 patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> was used in 24 patients with AF (17.5%); beta blockers were used in 95 patients with AF (69.3%) and 377 patients without AF (51.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide a snapshot of real-life contemporary daily clinical practice and evaluate AF burden and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most patients were found to have AF associated with one or more concomitant comorbidity </plain></SENT>
