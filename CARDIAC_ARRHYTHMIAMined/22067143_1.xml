<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Regadenoson is comparable to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> in pharmacologic radionuclide stress tests but has not been studied with stress myocardial contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the haemodynamic profile and ability of regadenoson, a novel selective A(2A) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> during myocardial contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed to measure myocardial blood volume, myocardial blood flow velocity, and total regional myocardial blood flow before and after administration of regadenoson (5 Âµg kg(-1), 10 s bolus) in 10 open-chest dogs with mild-to-moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> that was not flow limiting at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regadenoson decreased blood pressure but did not change heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It increased coronary blood flow significantly (P &lt; 0.05) for 30 min, which was attenuated in proportion to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas myocardial blood volume maximally increased by 0.5-0.75-fold in the control region, it did not change in the region supplied by the non-flow limiting stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion defects were visually and quantitatively detectable for as long as 10 min after administration of regadenoson </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were noted with regadenoson either prior to or during myocardial contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regadenoson can be used as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> stress agent with myocardial contrast echocardiography to detect the presence of physiologically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The optimum time for image acquisition was 3-10 min after drug administration </plain></SENT>
