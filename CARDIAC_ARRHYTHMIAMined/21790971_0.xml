<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although low-energy extracorporeal cardiac shock wave (ECSW) therapy represents an attractive non-invasive treatment option for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, the precise mechanisms of its action and influence on the cardiac tissue remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of SW application on cardiac function and structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four-month-old Fisher 344 rats were subjected to ECSW therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic measurements of cardiac function were performed at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the control and treated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECSW application did not provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or increase the troponin-I level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points, the left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis revealed neither differences in the extracellular matrix collagen content nor the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>; similarly, there were no signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a population of cardiac cells that responded eagerly to ECSW application in the adult heart was identified; c-kit-positive, Ki67-positive, orthochromatic cells, corresponding to cardiac primitive cells, were 2.65-fold more numerous in the treated myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, non-invasive ECSW therapy is a safe and effective way of activating cardiac stem cells and myocardial regeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because many factors influence cellular turnover in the ischaemic myocardium during the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, cardiac remodelling, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> progression, studies to identify the optimal treatment time are warranted </plain></SENT>
