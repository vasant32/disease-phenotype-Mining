<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is seen in young people without demonstrable cardiac pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to review the clinical picture of idiopathic VT, before evaluating the indications for antiarrhythmic treatment and the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The notes of patients diagnosed with idiopathic VT in the last 13 years (n: 22) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 11 years (1 month-16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the findings regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common initial symptom was palpitation, in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five children with idiopathic VT were symptom-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VT was of right ventricular origin in 10 patients and left ventricular origin in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-blockers were the mainstay of medical treatment in right VT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (Ca-channel blocker) were mostly used in left VT cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The success rate of RFA was 57% in right VT and 100% in left VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 41 months (9 months-60 months), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are alive currently with no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VT without demonstrable cardiac pathology is associated with a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment is unnecessary for asymptomatic non-sustained VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RFA is useful in patients with symptomatic drug-refractory idiopathic VT arising from the left or right ventricle </plain></SENT>
