<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that lowering blood pressure by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>-receptor blockers (ARB) has more beneficial effects than by conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> (CCB) on the frequency of paroxysmal AF with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Japanese Rhythm Management Trial II for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> (J-RHYTHM II study) is an open-label randomized comparison between an ARB (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>) and a CCB (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi>) in the treatment of paroxysmal AF associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using daily transtelephonic monitoring, we examined asymptomatic and symptomatic paroxysmal AF episodes during a maximum 1 year treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the difference in AF frequency between the pre-treatment period and the final month of the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints included cardiovascular events, development of persistent AF, left atrial dimension, and quality-of-life (QOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study enrolled 318 patients (66 years, male/female 219/99, 158 in the ARB group and 160 in the CCB group) treated at 48 sites throughout Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the frequency of AF episodes (days/month) was 3.8 ± 5.0 in the ARB group vs. 4.8 ± 6.3 in the CCB group (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, blood pressure was significantly lower in the CCB group than in the ARB group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AF frequency decreased similarly in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups in the development of persistent AF, changes in left atrial dimension, occurrence of cardiovascular events, or changes in QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with paroxysmal AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> did not have an advantage over <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> in the reduction in the frequency of paroxysmal AF (umin CTR C000000427) </plain></SENT>
