<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of PNS over mid-term follow-up and the significance of PNS are less certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 1307 patients enrolled in pre-market studies of LV leads manufactured by Medtronic (models 4193 and 4195 unipolar, 4194, 4196, 4296, and 4396 bipolar) were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead location was recorded at implant using a common classification scheme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phrenic nerve stimulation symptoms were either spontaneously reported or identified at scheduled follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A PNS-related complication was defined as PNS resulting in invasive intervention or the termination of LV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up was 14.9 months (range 0.0-46.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phrenic nerve stimulation symptoms occurred in 169 patients (12.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phrenic nerve stimulation-related complications occurred in 21 of 1307 patients (1.6%); 16 of 738 (2.2%) in the unipolar lead studies, and 5 of 569 (0.9%) in the bipolar lead studies (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phrenic nerve stimulation was more frequent at middle-lateral/posterior, and apical LV sites (139/1010) vs. basal-posterior/lateral/anterior, and middle-anterior sites (20/297; P= 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As compared with an anterior LV lead position, a lateral LV pacing site was associated with over a four-fold higher risk of PNS (P= 0.005) and an apical LV pacing site was associated with over six-fold higher risk of PNS (P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Phrenic nerve stimulation occurred in 13% of patients undergoing LV lead placement and was more common at mid-lateral/posterior, and LV apical sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most cases (123/139; 88%) of PNS were mitigated via electrical reprogramming, without the need for invasive intervention </plain></SENT>
