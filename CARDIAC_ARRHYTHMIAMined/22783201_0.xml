<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dispersion in repolarization is a prerequisite for the initiation of re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that regionally decreased wall motion is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured local activation times, activation-recovery intervals (ARIs, surrogate for action potential duration), and repolarization times using a multielectrode grid at nine segments on the left ventricular epicardium in 23 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional wall motion was simultaneously assessed using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three groups were discriminated: (1) Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> wall motion (n = 11), (2) Patients with one or more hypokinetic segments (n = 6), (3) Patients with one or more akinetic or dyskinetic segments (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average ARI was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (251 ± 3.7 ms, ±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dispersion of ARIs between the nine segments was significantly increased in the hypokinetic (84 ± 7.4 ms, p &lt; 0.005) and akinetic/dyskinetic group (94 ± 3.5 ms, p &lt; 0.0005) compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (49 ± 5.1 ms), independent from the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repolarization <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> occurred primarily in the normally contracting regions of the hearts with abnormal wall motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An almost maximal increased dispersion of repolarization was observed when there was only a single hypokinetic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inhomogeneous wall motion abnormality of even moderate severity is associated with increased repolarization inhomogeneity, independent from the presence of infarction </plain></SENT>
