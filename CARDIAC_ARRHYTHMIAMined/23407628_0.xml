<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to conduct a systematic review of the published literature, assessing the risk of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and mortality in patients with AF treated with VKAs.METHODS AND RESULTS: Online searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Library were performed to a pre-specified protocol from 1960 to March 2012 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and from January 1990 to March 2012 for observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 47 studies (16 RCTs and 31 observational studies) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative follow-up was 61 563 patient-years for RCTs and 484 241 patient-years for observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall median incidence of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was 2.1 per 100 patient-years (range, 0.9-3.4 per 100 patient-years) for RCTs and 2.0 per 100 patient-years (range, 0.2-7.6 per 100 patient-years) for observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With study year as a proxy for changing management patterns, some evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rates and/or their reporting increasing over time was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates from observational studies were inadequately reported to allow comparison with those from RCT data.CONCLUSION: The median rate of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in observational studies and RCTs is similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rates observed in a real-life setting could reflect a high variability in standard of care of patients on VKAs and/or methodological differences between observational studies and/or variability in data sources </plain></SENT>
