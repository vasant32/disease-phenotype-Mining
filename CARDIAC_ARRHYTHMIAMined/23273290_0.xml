<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify families affected by early repolarization syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>) and to determine the mode of transmission of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early repolarization (ER) has recently been linked to idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the disease has been suggested but not demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened relatives of 4 families affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ER was defined as a distinct J-wave in at least 2 consecutive leads and a 1-mm amplitude above baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Valsalva maneuver was performed in affected and unaffected family members to decrease heart rate and thus increase or reveal an ER pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the 4 families including 10 before 35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 4 families, the prevalence of ER was 56%, 34%, 61%, and 33% of, respectively, 30, 82, 29, and 30 screened relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these families, transmission of an ER pattern is compatible with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> probands were screened for genes identified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>, and no mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Valsalva maneuver was performed in 80 relatives, resulting in increased J-wave amplitude for 17 of 20 affected patients and revealing an ER pattern in 17 relatives in whom 5 are obligate transmitters of an ER pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e> can be inherited through <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission and should be considered a real inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Familial investigation can be facilitated by using the Valsalva maneuver to reveal the electrocardiographic pattern in family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prognosis value of this test remains to be assessed </plain></SENT>
