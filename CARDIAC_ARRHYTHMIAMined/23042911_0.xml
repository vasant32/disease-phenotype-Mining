<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a canine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (healed infarction, with ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by an exercise plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> test, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>+); we previously reported that endurance exercise training was antiarrhythmic in this model (Billman GE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 VF+ animals were studied, after random assignment to 10 wk of endurance exercise training (EET; n = 21) or a matched sedentary period (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following (&gt;1 wk) the final attempted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induction, isolated myocytes were used to test the hypotheses that the endurance exercise-induced antiarrhythmic effects resulted from normalization of cellular electrophysiology and/or normalization of calcium handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EET prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and shortened in vivo repolarization (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sedentary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>+ dogs had a significant reduction in repolarizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current, which was restored by exercise training (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, myocytes from the sedentary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>+ group displayed calcium alternans, increased calcium spark frequency, and increased phosphorylation of S2814 on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2 </plain></SENT>
