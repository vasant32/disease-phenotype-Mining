<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The economic impact of pharmacist-managed antiarrhythmic drug therapy monitoring on an academic medical center's electrophysiology (EP) program was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected for the initial two years of patient visits (n = 816) to a pharmacist-run clinic for antiarrhythmic drug therapy monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cost analysis was conducted to assess the direct costs associated with three appointment models: (1) a clinic office visit only, (2) a clinic visit involving electrocardiography and basic laboratory tests, and (3) a clinic visit including pulmonary function testing and chest x-rays in addition to electrocardiography and laboratory testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subset of patient cases (n = 18) were included in a crossover analysis comparing pharmacist clinic care and usual care in an EP physician clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were the cost benefits and cost savings associated with pharmacy-clinic care versus usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A secondary endpoint was improvement of overall EP program efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The payer mix was 61.6% (n = 498) Medicare, 33.2% (n = 268) managed care, and 5.2% (n = 42) other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive contribution margins were demonstrated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> appointment models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pharmacist-managed clinic also yielded cost savings by reducing overall patient care charges by 21% relative to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By the second year, the pharmacy clinic improved EP program efficiency by scheduling an average of 24 patients per week, in effect freeing up one day per week of EP physician time to spend on other clinical activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pharmacist monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in an out-patient clinic provided cost benefits, cost savings, and improved overall EP program efficiency </plain></SENT>
