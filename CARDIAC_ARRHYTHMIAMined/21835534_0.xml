<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> sites in the right ventricular outflow tract were ablated in a prospective series of 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had a poor quality of life and had not responded to antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean of 3 radiofrequency pulses per site was applied and mean application time was 113±15s </plain></SENT>
