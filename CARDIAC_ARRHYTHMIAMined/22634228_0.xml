<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>Scarring</z:hpo> may cause independent, layered epicardial activation and promote epicardially confined <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize transmural right ventricular activation in ARVD patients and to compare this with reference patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen ARVD patients underwent detailed endocardial and epicardial sinus rhythm electroanatomic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bipolar activation was annotated at the sharpest intrinsic deflection including late potentials and compared with 6 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total scar area was larger on the epicardium (97±78 cm(2)) than the endocardium (57±44 cm(2); P=0.04), with significantly more isolated potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total epicardial activation time was longer than endocardial (172±54 versus 99±27 ms; P&lt;0.01), and both were longer than in reference patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Earliest endocardial site was the right ventricular anteroseptum in 17 of 18 ARVD patients versus 5 of 6 controls (P=0.446), and latest endocardial site was in the outflow tract in 13 of 18 ARVD patients versus 4 of 6 controls and tricuspid annulus in 5 of 18 ARVD patients versus 2 of 6 controls (P=1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In reference patients, epicardial activation directly opposite endocardial sites occurred in 5.2±1.9 ms, suggesting direct transmural activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ARVD patients had major activation delay to the epicardium with laminar central scar activation from the scar border, not by direct transmural spread from the endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transmural right ventricular activation is modified by ARVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> with a delayed epicardial activation sequence suggestive of independent rather than direct transmural activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may predispose <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> circuits contained entirely within the epicardium in ARVD and explains observations on the need for direct epicardial ablation to eliminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
