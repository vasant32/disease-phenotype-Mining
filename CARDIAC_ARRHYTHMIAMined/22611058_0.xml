<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It aims at identifying independent risk factors for mortality during CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study includes 239 consecutive patients who had undergone implantation of a CRT-D system (ejection fraction 25.9 ± 8%; 139 patients with ischaemic, 100 patients with non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enrolment took place between 2001 and 2010, resulting in a median follow-up of 43 ± 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 59 patients (25%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An impaired baseline kidney function [hazard ratio (HR) 1.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-3; P&lt; 0.0001], appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy during follow-up (HR 2.1; CI 1.1-3.4; P= 0.001), lack of beta-blocker therapy (HR 2.3; CI 1.6-3.8; P= 0.004), and intake of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (HR 2; CI 1.8-4.1; P&lt; 0.0001) were identified as predictors of overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the benefit of beta-blocker therapy also in patients on long-term CRT-D treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It confirms the prognostic significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> and the occurrence of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies also in CRT-D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It argues for an intensified follow-up regimen and adjustment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> treatment whenever these prognostic markers are identified in a patient treated with CRT-D </plain></SENT>
