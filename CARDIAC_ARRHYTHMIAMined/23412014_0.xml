<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> is due to mutations of several possible genes (genotype) that result in prolongation of the corrected QT interval (phenotype) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main mechanism responsible for the development of QT prolongation is blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I (kr)), encoded for by the human-<z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this review were (1) to describe the electrical pathophysiology of QT interval abnormalities, (2) to differentiate congenital from acquired QT interval abnormalities, (3) to describe the currently known risk factors for QT interval abnormalities, (4) to identify current drug-induced causes of acquired QT interval abnormalities, and (5) to recommend immediate and effective management strategies to prevent unanticipated dysrhythmias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from QT abnormalities in the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
