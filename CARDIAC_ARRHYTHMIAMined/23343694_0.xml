<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently reported prospective results from a cohort of patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in which most baseline clinical parameters of patients and surgery outcomes failed to demonstrate relationships with post-CPB antithrombin (AT) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this extension study, a larger sample size (250 patients) was analyzed following general linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients' sociodemographic and pre-CPB clinical data as well as pre/post-CPB AT activity and outcomes were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease of post-CPB AT activity (95.6 ± 13.7-64.6 ± 12.1%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a decrease of approximately 1% post-CPB AT activity may be expected per 3 years increase in patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that post-CBP AT activity was inversely related to the need for transfusions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> and occurrence of any complication (re-intervention, low cardiac output, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, lung dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920157" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mesenteric ischemia</z:e> and re-hospitalization; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and pre-CPB AT did not show statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR) less than 1 was observed in most outcomes (0.8 on average), which suggested a reduction of the probability for an increase of 10% in post-CBP AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the role of low postsurgery AT activity influencing outcomes in patients undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
