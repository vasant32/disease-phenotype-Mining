<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Right atrial (RA) enlargement and increased electrocardiographic P-wave dispersion (Pd) independently predict the development of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on the degree of right atrial (RA) geometrical and electrical remodeling following device closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed in 58 consecutive patients (47±17years) before and at 3months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent RA enlargement was defined as RA volume index (RAVI) ≥21ml/m(2) at 3months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pd was calculated as the difference between maximal and minimal P-wave durations in 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RA size reduced (RAVI: 50±28 vs. 26±16ml/m(2), p&lt;0.001) and Pd on ECG decreased (53±17 vs. 49±20ms, p&lt;0.05) significantly at 3months when compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, persistent RA enlargement remained evident in 31 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a group, they were older with higher pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, larger Qp/Qs, longer maximal P-wave duration and Pd than those with normalized RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pd reduction only occurred in patients with normalized RA size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3-month Pd (hazard ratio: 1.033, p&lt;0.001) predicted the presence of incomplete RA geometrical remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ROC curve revealed that Pd ≥45ms at 3months was 77% sensitive and 86% specific in revealing residual RA enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both atrial geometrical and electrical reverse remodeling were evident at 3months following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, only half of the included patients had normalization of RA size which could be revealed by a simple ECG surrogate of intra-atrial conduction disturbance </plain></SENT>
