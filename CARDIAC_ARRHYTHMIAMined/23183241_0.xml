<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite significant advances in medical and interventional therapy, the prognosis of conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> is still dismal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is thus a need to investigate new therapeutic tools, one of which is stem cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cells are the most studied type, and the fact that their biology is relatively well understood has led to their being used in preclinical research and clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the results of some of these studies have been controversial, which has opened the way for studies on other cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cells have immunomodulatory properties which suggest that they have therapeutic potential in cardiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present article, the authors review the state of the art regarding mesenchymal stem cells, from basic and translational research to their use in clinical trials on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and discuss possible future uses </plain></SENT>
