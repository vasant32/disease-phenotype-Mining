<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients &lt;21 years old who underwent ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> using three-dimensional (3D) mapping with no or minimal fluoroscopy at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent electrophysiology studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or frequent premature ventricular complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and two patients had left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electro-anatomic mapping with the 3D EnSite NavX system and radiofrequency ablation was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No fluoroscopy was used in the patients with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two patients with left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> had 1.0 and 1.9 min of fluoroscopy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure time was 168 min (range 95 to 270) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There has been no recurrence at mean follow-up of &gt;1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional mapping systems have allowed pediatric electrophysiologic procedures to be performed with minimal to no fluoroscopy in patients with challenging <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease in radiation exposure decreases the risk of long-term adverse sequelae resulting from radiation exposure, which is especially important in children </plain></SENT>
