<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to characterize a novel mutation in Na(v)1.5 found in a newborn with fetal chaotic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, post-partum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction delay</z:e>, and QT interval prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons and intron borders of 15 ion-channel genes were sequenced, revealing a novel missense mutation (Q270K) in SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Na(v)1.5 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and Q270K were expressed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 with and without the Na(v)β1 subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp analysis showed ∼40% reduction in peak <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel current (I(Na)) density for Q270K compared with WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fast and slow decay of I(Na) were significantly slower in Q270K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Steady-state activation and inactivation of Q270K channels were shifted to positive potentials, and window current was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">tetrodotoxin</z:chebi>-sensitive late I(Na) was increased almost 3-fold compared with WT channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine reduced late I(Na) in WT and Q270K channels, while exerting minimal effects on peak I(Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Q270K mutation in SCN5A reduces peak I(Na) while augmenting late I(Na), and may thus underlie the development of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction delay</z:e>, and QT interval prolongation in an infant </plain></SENT>
