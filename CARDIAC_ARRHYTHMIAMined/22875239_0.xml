<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of recurring arrhythmic events (also known as cardiac dysrhythmia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>irregular heartbeats</z:hpo>), as well as erroneous beat detection due to low signal quality, significantly affects estimation of both time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reliable, real-time classification and correction of ECG-derived heartbeats is a necessary prerequisite for an accurate online monitoring of HRV and cardiovascular control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel point-process-based method for real-time R-R interval error detection and correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given an R-wave event, we assume that the length of the next R-R interval follows a physiologically motivated, time-varying inverse Gaussian probability distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then devise an instantaneous automated detection and correction procedure for erroneous and arrhythmic beats by using the information on the probability of occurrence of the observed beat provided by the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We test our algorithm over two datasets from the PhysioNet archive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Fantasia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rhythm database is artificially corrupted with known erroneous beats to test both the detection procedure and correction procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The benchmark <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> database is further considered to test the detection procedure of real arrhythmic events and compare it with results from previously published algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our automated algorithm represents an improvement over previous procedures, with best specificity for the detection of correct beats, as well as highest sensitivity to missed and extra beats, artificially misplaced beats, and for real arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A near-optimal heartbeat classification and correction, together with the ability to adapt to time-varying changes of heartbeat dynamics in an online fashion, may provide a solid base for building a more reliable real-time HRV monitoring device </plain></SENT>
