<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eventually, in most patients, the originally favorable loading conditions give way to unfavorable remodeling, which results in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and dilation, and ultimately symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> is a clear indication for surgical correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal management of asymptomatic patients is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While asymptomatic severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients who have developed LV dysfunction or LV dilation warrant surgery, the decision to operate without these findings hinges on the presence of other clinical sequelae, such as atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, and on the likelihood of successful mitral valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists as to the optimal approach to patients without any of these objective triggers, with some evidence supporting earlier prophylactic surgery and other evidence supporting a "watch and wait" approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is our conviction that in absence of an established guideline-based indication for surgical correction, for most asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, the preferred approach is close monitoring with serial echocardiography for development of symptoms or other clinical sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is reasonable to consider earlier surgical correction in select asymptomatic patients in whom there is a high likelihood of successful mitral valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we comprehensively review <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> guideline-based management of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, and discuss new evidence that impacts clinical decision-making in these patients </plain></SENT>
