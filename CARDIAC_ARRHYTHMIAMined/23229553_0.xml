<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is thought to be triggered by an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and can be reproduced in various animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> inflammatory mediator, platelet-activating factor (PAF), synthesized by activated neutrophils, can induce atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> as well as repolarization abnormalities in isolated ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that carbamylated PAF-induced repolarization abnormalities result from the protein kinase C (PKC) Îµ-dependent phosphorylation of the two-pore domain <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel TASK-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now demonstrate that canine peri-op AF is associated with the phosphorylation-dependent loss of TASK-1 current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies identified threonine 383 in the C terminus of human and canine TASK-1 as the phosphorylation site required for PAF-dependent inhibition of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a novel phosphorylation site-specific antibody targeting the phosphorylated channel, we have determined that peri-op AF is associated with the loss of TASK-1 current and increased phosphorylation of TASK-1 at this site </plain></SENT>
