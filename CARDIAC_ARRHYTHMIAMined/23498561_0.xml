<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has theoretical benefits on brain preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to be effective in improving neurological outcomes after adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neonatal asphyxia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there have only been a few reports about therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> after pediatric resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted this retrospective cohort study in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit between January 2010 and June 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children from 2 months to 18 years of age with resuscitation and a history of at least 3 minutes of chest compressions with survival for 12 hours or more after return of circulation were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients met the eligibility criteria for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (97.6%) were asphyxial in etiology; 29 (67.4%) of them occurred out-of-hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding one child with cardiac etiology, the overall survival rate to hospital discharge was 57.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (33.3%) patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> therapy and were cooled to 33Â°C for 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was higher in the therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> group (11/14, 78.6%) than in the normothermia group (13/28, 46.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was associated with increased survival rate after pediatric resuscitation </plain></SENT>
