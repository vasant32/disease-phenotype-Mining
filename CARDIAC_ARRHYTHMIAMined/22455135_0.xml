<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty eight <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> patients were consecutively recruited to undergo myocardial perfusion SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Concurrent Imaging software was used to create 3 separate SPECT studies with heartbeat acceptance window of 20%, 60% and 100% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The software created the 3 studies separately rather than a rearrangement of an original list-mode acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reconstruction by Astonish, end-diastole volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), sum stress score (SSS), and sum rest score (SRS) were calculated with Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of variance were performed using SPSS to compare the differences in EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS among the three studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 85.7% of the 28 patients had abnormal perfusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences were found in EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS among the 3 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But the collection time was 40.5 min, 25.6 min and 15.0 min for heartbeat acceptance window of 20%, 60% and 100% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Heartbeat acceptance window setting does not have a significant effect on EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The wider the window is set, the shorter the collection time is </plain></SENT>
