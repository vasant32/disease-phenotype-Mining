<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The use of genetic engineering of unexcitable cells to enable expression of gap junctions and inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels has suggested that cell therapies aimed at establishing electrical coupling of unexcitable donor cells to host cardiomyocytes may be arrhythmogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether similar considerations apply when the donor cells are electrically excitable has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we tested the hypothesis that adenoviral transfer of genes coding Kir2.1 (I(K1)), Na(V)1.5 (I(Na)) and connexin-43 (Cx43) proteins into neonatal rat ventricular myofibroblasts (NRVF) will convert them into fully excitable cells, rescue rapid conduction velocity (CV) and reduce the incidence of complex reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in an in vitro model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used adenoviral (Ad-) constructs encoding Kir2.1, Na(V)1.5 and Cx43 in NRVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In single NRVF, Ad-Kir2.1 or Ad-Na(V)1.5 infection enabled us to regulate the densities of I(K1) and I(Na), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At varying MOI ratios of 10/10, 5/10 and 5/20, NRVF co-infected with Ad-Kir2.1+ Na(V)1.5 were hyperpolarized and generated action potentials (APs) with upstroke velocities &gt;100 V/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when forming monolayers only the addition of Ad-Cx43 made the excitable NRVF capable of conducting electrical impulses (CV = 20.71±0.79 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When genetically engineered excitable NRVF overexpressing Kir2.1, Na(V)1.5 and Cx43 were used to replace <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NRVF in heterocellular monolayers that included neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), CV was significantly increased (27.59±0.76 cm/s vs. 21.18±0.65 cm/s, p&lt;0.05), reaching values similar to those of pure myocytes monolayers (27.27±0.72 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, during reentry, propagation was faster and more organized, with a significantly lower number of wavebreaks in heterocellular monolayers formed by excitable compared with unexcitable NRVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> transfer of genes coding Kir2.1, Na(V)1.5 and Cx43 to cardiac myofibroblasts endows them with the ability to generate and propagate APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results provide proof of concept that cell therapies with excitable donor cells increase safety and reduce arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
