<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) currently relies on eliminating triggers, and no reliable method exists to map the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> itself to identify ablation targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this multicenter study was to define the use of Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation (FIRM) for identifying ablation targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled the first (n = 14, 11 males) consecutive patients undergoing FIRM-guided ablation for persistent (n = 11) and paroxysmal AF at 5 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 64-pole basket catheter was used for panoramic right and left atrial mapping during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF electrograms were analyzed using a novel system to identify sustained rotors (spiral waves), or focal beats (centrifugal activation to surrounding atrium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed first at identified sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF termination or organization (&gt;10% cycle length prolongation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional ablation was performed only after FIRM-guided ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve out of 14 cases were mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AF sources were demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (average of 1.9 ± 0.8 per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sources were left atrial in 18 cases, and right atrial in 5 cases, and 21/23 were rotors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FIRM-guided ablation achieved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> endpoint in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, consisting of AF termination in n = 8 (4.9 ± 3.9 minutes at the primary source), and organization in n = 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total FIRM time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 12.3 ± 8.6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FIRM-guided ablation revealed localized AF rotors/focal sources in patients with paroxysmal, persistent and longstanding persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Brief targeted FIRM-guided ablation at a priori identified sites terminated or substantially organized AF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases prior to any other ablation </plain></SENT>
