<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) ablation in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVD/C) has a low success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more extensive epicardial (Epi) arrhythmogenic substrate could explain the low efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the results of combined endocardial (Endo) and Epi VT ablation and conducting channel (CC) elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven consecutive patients with ARVD/C were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high-density 3D Endo (321±93 sites mapped) and Epi (302±158 sites mapped) electroanatomical voltage map was obtained during sinus rhythm to define scar areas (&lt;1.5 mV) and CCs inside the scars, between scars, or between the tricuspid annulus and a scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point of the ablation procedure was the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified CCs (scar dechanneling) and the abolition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inducible VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure and fluoroscopy time were 177±63 minutes and 20±8 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epi scar area was larger in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases (26±18 versus 94±45 cm(2), P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined Endo and Epi VT ablation eliminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and induced VTs, and the addition of scar dechanneling resulted in noninducibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients continued on sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 11 months (6-24 months), only 1 (9%) patient had a VT recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a single major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> event that did not preclude a successful procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined Endo and Epi mapping reveals a wider Epi VT substrate in patients with ARVD/C with clinical VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As a first-line therapy, combined Endo and Epi VT ablation incorporating scar dechanneling achieves a very good short- and midterm success rate </plain></SENT>
