<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported an imbalance within the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) as one putative cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations showed decreased cardio-respiratory coupling in depressive patients that were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7640">nortriptyline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare parameters of heart rate variability and cardio-respiratory coupling between unmedicated patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>) and healthy controls in order to further understand <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated eighteen unmedicated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269683" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="MDD">major depressive disorder</z:e> and eighteen matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram and respiratory signals were obtained during a twenty minute resting period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time- and frequency based parameters of HRV, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), approximate entropy of heart rate (ApEn(RR)) and respiratory rate (ApEn(Resp)) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cross-ApEn between RR-intervals and respiration time series was determined, reflecting coupling of both signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients showed an <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> and LF/HF-ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and ApEn(RR) were reduced in patients in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Breathing rate, ApEn(Resp) and cross-ApEn did not differ between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>Increased heart rate</z:mp>, increased LF/HF-ratio, reduced RSA and reduced ApEn(RR) indicate a decrease of cardiac vagal modulation in depressive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No difference of cardio-respiratory coupling was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Respiratory parameters and cross-ApEn did not differ between both groups, and thus we conclude that diminished vagal modulation is mainly limited to cardiac modulation </plain></SENT>
