<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A medical literature review suggests that the fastest human ventricular conduction rate reported to date in a tachyarrhythmia is 480 beats per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore report the fastest human heart rate noted in a tachyarrhythmia and the most probable mechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> being a rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with 1:1 conduction in the setting of probable co-existing multiple bypass tracts </plain></SENT>
