<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four patients (age, 56.5 ± 15.9 years; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Health Evaluation II score, 22.8 ± 6.7) underwent continuous recording of ECG and etCO(2) waveforms from intensive care unit admission and intubation to discharge or maximum of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overlapping 5-minute windows were analyzed with a wide range of variability measures (time, frequency, entropy, and scale-invariant and nonlinear domains) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Waveform data quality, presence of disconnections and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, quality of beat and breath detection, and subsequent variability computations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were enrolled for 11.0 ± 3.6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of missing waveform data among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was (median [interquartile range, maximum]) 2.9% (1.3%-9.7%, 36.4%) for ECG and 3.1% (1.1%-11.4%, 84.5%) for etCO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability data loss (ie, proportion of windows removed) was 1.3% (1.0%-2.1%, 5.9%) due to disconnection, 0.6% (0.1%-3.9%, 39.5%) due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and 6.6% (1.4%-17.9%, 89.0%) due to data cleaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Respiratory rate variability data loss was 7.3% (2.9%-11.6%, 47.7%) due to disconnection (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>) and 5.5% (2.9%-8.4%, 56.4%) due to cleaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous individualized multiorgan variability analysis processing resulted in HRV and RRV computations for 81.2% ± 25.0% and 87.5% ± 11.9% of available ECG and etCO(2) waveform data, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The quality of continuously recorded ECG and etCO(2) waveforms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients is adequate for subsequent continuous variability monitoring in this pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical utility of continuous variability analysis merits further investigation </plain></SENT>
