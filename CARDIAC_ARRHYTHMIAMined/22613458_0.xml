<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients discharged from our institution with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki Disease</z:e> between 1999 and 2007 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients meeting any of the following were excluded: presence of a comorbidity that necessitated echocardiogram follow-up independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> diagnosis, previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e>, or magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary arteries performed in place of echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preexisting or comorbid conditions resulting in study exclusion included structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and concomitant severe multiorgan disease at presentation (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The time course of echocardiogram surveillance among those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiogram at diagnosis was evaluated for compliance with published American Heart Association recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery involvement at presentation was characterized using standardized values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional characterization of national care practices for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> was obtained via distribution of an internet-based survey to pediatric hospitalists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, only 11 (4%) of 302 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> study at diagnosis received a total of three studies at recommended intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using standardized values for coronary artery dimensions in place of Japanese Ministry of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> criteria, 59 (13%) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> experienced coronary artery involvement at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of the early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coronary artery abnormalities</z:e> detected in these patients using standardized definitions persisted on short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pediatric hospitalist survey results revealed significant interinstitutional variability in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lack of optimal surveillance after a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> may result in the underdiagnosis of coronary artery pathology or other complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Considerable variability in surveillance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management exists, and additional research is needed to determine optimal screening and care delivery models for this population </plain></SENT>
