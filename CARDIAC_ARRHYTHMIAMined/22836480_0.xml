<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine the determinants of the mechanism of postoperative AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred patients with AT occurring at least 3 months after open heart surgery were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped according to the atrial incision applied at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 127 electrophysiology procedures, 151 ATs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight patients had cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL), 49 patients had at least one non-CTI-dependent AFL and 11 patients had focal AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While CTI-dependent AFL was equally prevalent across groups, the finding of a non-CTI-dependent AFL was progressively more common as more extensive atriotomy was applied (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients who had right atrial (RA) operations, RA incisional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was the most common non-CTI-dependent circuit, while the finding of perimitral or left atrial (LA) roof-dependent AFL was associated with LA atriotomy (p = 0.002 and p = 0.041, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for possible confounders, surgical group remained independent predictor of non-CTI-dependent AFLs (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No predictor was identified for focal AT, which originated from typical predilection sites and in 36% from the vicinity of surgical scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was highly effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ATs, but the recurrence rate of AFL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was high at 22% and 27%, respectively, during 19 ± 15 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While CTI-dependent AFL is the most common AT late after open heart surgery, atypical AFL becomes progressively more common with more extensive atriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Right atrial incisional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> is the dominant non-CTI-dependent AFL after opening of the RA, while a perimitral or roof-dependent LA circuit can be expected after LA operations </plain></SENT>
