<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) is evolving as an established treatment option in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different fluoroscopy-guided ablation devices exist either on the basis of expandable circumferential and mesh designs with mapping and ablation of pulmonary vein potentials, or of a balloon technology, a "single shot" device with a purely anatomical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systematic comparisons between procedure duration (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), fluoroscopy time (FT) and clinical outcome in using different ablation tools are lacking in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a single center retrospective analysis, 119 PVI procedures were performed between August 2008 and March 2011 in paroxysmal AF (PAF, 59.7%) and persistent AF (persAF, 40.3%) patients with mean age of 59.4±10.3 years and history of AF since 8.1±9.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PVI procedures were evaluated by comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and FT using I) the High Density Mesh Mapper (HDMM), II) the High Density Mesh Ablator (HDMA), and III) the Arctic Front® Cryoballoon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were FT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, the secondary endpoint was procedural safety and efficacy in short- and longterm follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedures performed for 119 patients (63.0 % male) included 42 PVIs with the HDMM (35.3 %), 47 with the HDMA (39.5 %) and 30 with the cryoballoon (25.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing the 30 first procedures in groups of 10 in the HDMM and HDMA group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and FT fell in the HDMM group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> from 257.5 to 220.9 min and FT from 80.5 to 67.3 min, both p &lt; 0.05) as well as in the HDMA group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> from 182.9 to 147.2 min and FT from 41.02 to 29.1 min, both p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cryoballoon group, there was a steep learning curve with a steady state after the first 10 procedures (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and FT decreased significantly from 189.5 to 138.1 min and 36.9 to 27.3 min, p values 0.005 and 0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to recurrence of AF in a 24 months follow up, the HDMM and cryoballoon group showed comparable results with ~72% of patients free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients died due to severe complications, or suffered a hemodynamic relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Impairment of the phrenic nerve was observed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of the cryoballoon technology was associated with a steep learning curve and a reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and FT; the long-term outcome was similar compared with the HDMM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of the devices but also <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and FT should be respected as the strongest indicators of the quality of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies with long time follow-ups will show if the time for correct mapping of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> potentials is a price we should be willing to pay or if we should adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude referring the AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
