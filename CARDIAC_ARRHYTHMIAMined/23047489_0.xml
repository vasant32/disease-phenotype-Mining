<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study retrospectively analysed 362 consecutive patients who underwent CRT device implantation over a 6 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre-implantation, LV-only paced, and biventricularly paced 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular and right ventricular (RV) lead positions were determined using biplane fluoroscopy and roentgenograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival function for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/hospitalization and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were also applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 24.7 Â± 16.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 79 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (62 cardiovascular) and 99 unplanned hospitalizations (72 cardiovascular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One year and 2 year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rates were 8.5 and 18.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic and fluoroscopic descriptors of the LV lead position were found to be predictors of mortality/morbidity (as were functional class, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> aetiology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, the antero-apical pattern of LV-only paced QRS showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.8 in univariate and 1.7 in multivariate analysis for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/hospitalization (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apical/paraseptal LV lead position showed an HR of 2.1 in univariate and 1.9 in multivariate analysis for predicting cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/hospitalization (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To achieve better long-term outcomes in CRT patients the antero-apical pattern of LV QRS complexes and apical or paraseptal LV lead position should be avoided </plain></SENT>
