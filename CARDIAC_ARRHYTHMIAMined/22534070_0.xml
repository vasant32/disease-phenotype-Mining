<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Only a few studies have investigated the effect of large tip sizes for catheter-based cryoablation (cryo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of cryo of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) using three cryocatheter-tip sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive patients with common <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) underwent cryo of the CTI using a 6.5, a 10, or a novel 15 mm catheter-tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single applications of 3 min were delivered at each site along the CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate was 89% and there was no difference with respect to the tip electrode size (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fewer applications were required for a 10 mm (6 ± 2, range 3-7) and a 15 mm (6 ± 1, range 4-8) compared with a 6.5 mm catheter-tip (8 ± 3, range 4-14; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure time was significantly shorter with the largest tip electrode (89 ± 26 min vs. 132 ± 28 min (6.5 mm tip), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 51 ± 5 months, 43 patients (96%) were without recurrence of AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large (10 or 15 mm) cryoablation catheter-tip requires significantly fewer applications to create bidirectional CTI block compared with a 6.5 mm tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in procedure time with preservation of the overall safety and efficacy supports the preference of a 15 over a 6.5 mm catheter-tip for cryoablation of AFL </plain></SENT>
