<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyse preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors and their relationships with the occurrence and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (152 men, age 62.7 ± 10.1 years) underwent surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracorporeal circulation was used in 64 patients and minimal extracorporeal circulation was used in 75 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients underwent surgery without extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first three postoperative days, subjects were monitored for the duration and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, laboratory markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (C-reactive protein, leucocytes) and serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic data and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in the groups were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 56% (110 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was found in the extracorporeal circulation subgroup, with a significantly lower incidence using minimal extracorporeal circulation, and in patients operated on without extracorporeal circulation (75 vs 47 vs 46%, P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The longest duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was found in patients operated on with extracorporeal circulation compared with minimal extracorporeal circulation, and without extracorporeal circulation (9.7 ± 11.6 vs 4.9 ± 8.3 vs 3.1 ± 5.2, P ≤0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> significantly correlated with elevation of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, leucocytes) compared with patients who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P ≤0.001, P ≤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The values of serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The relationship between postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and echocardiographic parameters was not confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of extracorporeal circulation leads to a higher incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared with the use of minimal extracorporeal circulation or with surgery without extracorporeal circulation, probably due to enhanced systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
