<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This admission modality is often problematic both for the patients and the emergency healthcare professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct admission from home (or nursing home) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> geriatric units (<z:mp ids='MP_0011516'>AGU</z:mp>) has been developed but has never been prospectively assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a 6-month prospective observational study to compare the 97 patients admitted through the emergency room (ER) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0011516'>AGU</z:mp> of Bichat's hospital to the 76 patients admitted directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collected data included socio-demographic and medical baseline data, clinical severity score at admission, cause of hospitalization, final diagnosis, in-hospital occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> and of pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, length of stay, discharge disposition and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences between the groups were found for most baseline characteristics, clinical severity score, occurrence of pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, length of stay and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However ER patients were significantly older (88±6 vs 86±7 years, p = 0.04) and had more often history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (29% vs 15%, p=0.02) and protein-energy <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> preceding admission (63% vs 46%, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo> as admission cause was more common in ER patients while unexplained health status or functional decline were most common in those admitted directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were less favourable in ER patients with significantly more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retentions</z:hpo> (25% vs 4%, p=0.0002) and transfers to rehabilitation units (48% vs 31%, p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients admitted directly returned more often at home without additional social support (53% vs 30%, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Direct admission in <z:mp ids='MP_0011516'>AGU</z:mp> is feasible, medically effective and provides an alternative to attending an emergency room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This admission modality could be specially suitable for elder people suffering from an unexplained functional or health status declines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to support the hypothesis that quality gains and cost-effective measures may be achieved by dissemination of such an admission modality at the hospital </plain></SENT>
