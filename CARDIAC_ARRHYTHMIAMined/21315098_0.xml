<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> activity was indexed by baseline salivary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, and PNS activity was indexed by baseline respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study 1 consisted of 57 children (54% girls; M age=8.81 years ±.34), and Study 2 included 219 children (51% girls; M age=9.31 years ±.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> interacted with RSA to explain unique variance in children's internalizing symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Across the two studies, children with higher <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels in conjunction with higher RSA levels tended to exhibit the lowest levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings demonstrate that contemporaneous consideration of physiological activity across multiple systems can advance understanding of internalizing symptoms in children </plain></SENT>
