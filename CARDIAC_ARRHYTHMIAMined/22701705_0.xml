<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> and its inactive analog 2,5-dimethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi>, can suppress or augment ionic currents and alter functioning of neurons and myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand these unexpected effects, we have recently investigated the mechanism of inhibition of human K(v)2.1 channels by a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor SC-791 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we have further explored the SC-791 action on ion channels and heartbeat in Drosophila, which lacks cyclooxygenases and thus can serve as a convenient model to study COX-2-independent mechanisms of coxibs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using intracellular recordings in combination with a pharmacological approach and utilizing available Drosophila mutants, we found that SC-791 inhibited voltage-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> and L-type Ca(2+) channels in larval body-wall muscles and <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and several other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blockers, SC-791 did not induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead, application of SC-791 resulted in a dramatic slowing of contractions and, at higher concentrations, in progressively weaker contractions with gradual cessation of heartbeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isradipine, a selective blocker of L-type Ca(2+) channels, showed a similar pattern of heart arrest, though no prolongation of contractions was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">Ryanodine</z:chebi> was the only channel modulating compound of those tested additionally that was capable of slowing contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Like SC-791, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it could not stop heartbeat completely even at 500 ÂµM, the highest concentration used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of heart rate reduction, when SC-791 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> were applied together, was smaller than expected for independent mechanisms, raising the possibility that SC-791 might be interfering with excitation-contraction coupling in Drosophila heart </plain></SENT>
