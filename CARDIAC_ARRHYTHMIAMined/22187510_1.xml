<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy and incident AF have yielded mixed results and not focused on individuals with an underlying pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is associated with incident AF and whether treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> is associated with a lower incidence of AF compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized men and women with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;130 mg/dL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein â‰¥2 mg/L to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was determined from treatment-blind adverse event reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 17 120 participants without prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, each increasing tertile of baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was associated with a 36% increase in the risk of developing AF (95% CI: 1.16-1.60; P-trend &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allocation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> when compared with placebo was associated with a 27% reduction in the relative risk of developing AF during the trial period; specifically, AF was reported among 138 participants in the placebo group and 100 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> group (incidence rate 0.78 vs. 0.56/100 person-years, HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56-0.94, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exclusion of participants who developed a major cardiovascular event prior to the report of AF yielded similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Within the JUPITER trial cohort of individuals selected for underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, increasing levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were associated with an increased risk of incident AF and random allocation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38545">rosuvastatin</z:chebi> significantly reduced that risk </plain></SENT>
