<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of AF as the first clinical diagnosis in patients with BS and their demographic and clinical characteristics and diagnosis management in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient group consisted of 611 patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data from those with a diagnosis of AF previous to the identification of BS were analyzed (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were unmasked after the initiation of a class I antiarrhythmic drug and one during the establishment of general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining population, BS was diagnosed using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> test performed mainly because of younger age in patients with lone AF (n = 13), previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (n = 3), or a clinical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in the family (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 49 Â± 15 years, 21 were male patients, 14 had a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, 15 had had previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and 4 had survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant electrical disorder was found in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, 21 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings on the baseline electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AF could be one of the first clinical manifestations of latent BS in a considerable number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This identification is crucial because the treatment of these patients is subject to relevant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> test plays an essential role, mainly in young patients with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, despite having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings on a baseline electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
