<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present analysis was to use the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry to analyze outcomes of childhood RCM, with a focus on the impact of phenotype comparing pure RCM with cases that have additional features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Registry database (1990-2008; N=3375) for cases of RCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were defined as pure when RCM was the only assigned diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional documentation of HCM at any time was used as the criterion for RCM/HCM phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RCM accounted for 4.5% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 101 (66%), pure RCM was diagnosed; in 51 (34%), there was a mixed phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis was not different between groups, but 10% of the pure RCM group was diagnosed in infancy versus 24% of the RCM/HCM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was comparable between groups with 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival of RCM 82%, 80%, and 68% versus RCM/HCM 77%, 74%, and 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transplant-free survival was 48%, 34%, and 22% and 65%, 53%, and 43%, respectively (P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors at diagnosis for lower transplant-free survival were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 2.20, P=0.005), lower fractional shortening z score (hazard ratio 1.12 per 1 SD decrease in z score, P=0.014), and higher posterior wall thickness in the RCM/HCM group only (hazard ratio 1.32, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, outcomes were worse than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transplant-free survival is poor for RCM in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival is independent of phenotype; however, the RCM/HCM phenotype has significantly better transplant-free survival </plain></SENT>
