<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi> (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) on new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF in a large cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a population-based study of 28 620 patients, from community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries who had been hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or coronary revascularization (1995-2004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, 65 years and older, had a mean follow-up period of upto 3.8 Â± 3.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of AF before and during hospitalization were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF between patients who were (N= 10 918) and were not (N= 17 702) prescribed ACEI and/or ARB within 1 month of hospital discharge following cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF within 5 and 10 years was 39.1 and 61.1%, respectively, in patients who received ACEI/ARB, compared 34.9 and 53.6% in patients who did not receive them [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.21] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis adjusting for patient- and hospital-related characteristics indicated that ACEI/ARB use independently had no impact on the risk of developing new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF compared with non-users (adjusted HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for propensity-score and health-seeking behaviours yielded nearly identical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>/ARB therapy initiated within 1 month after hospital discharge is not associated with a reduction in the risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or coronary revascularization </plain></SENT>
