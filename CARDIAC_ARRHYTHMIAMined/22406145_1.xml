<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has been performed for more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data about the long-term results were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-tem efficacy following <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation and to investigate whether there were different patterns of recurrences in patients with different CHADS(2) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 238 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who received a catheter ablation from 2004 to 2007 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Free of recurrence was defined as the absence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> without using any antiarrhythmic agents after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 121 patients (50.8%) suffering from recurrences after the first ablation procedure during a median follow-up period of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CHADS(2) score and left atrial diameter were significant predictors of recurrences in the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different patterns of recurrence were observed in different groups of patients categorized on the base of CHADS(2) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a CHADS(2) score of â‰¥3 without recurrences at 2 years postablation, 63.6% experienced episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during the subsequent follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients with a CHADS(2) score of 0 without recurrences at 2 years postablation, the future recurrence rate was only 2.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After a successful ablation, recurrences may continue to occur without reaching a plateau during the long-term follow-up, especially in patients with a high CHADS(2) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The optimal follow-up strategy may differ and should be individualized for patients with different scores </plain></SENT>
