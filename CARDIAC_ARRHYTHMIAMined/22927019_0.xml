<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite of high success rate and minimal operative mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during and post operation has been frequently observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this present case, we present one rare case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, which developed 71 hours after deployment of an Amplatzer-type occluder for perimembranous <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp>) in a 3 year and 5 month-old boy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was successfully corrected with the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reoccurrence of VT was not observed in the most recent follow-up at 6 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the current case indicated that sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> could occur following deployment of Amplatzer-type occluder for <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp>, which could be corrected with antiarrhythmic drugs.
