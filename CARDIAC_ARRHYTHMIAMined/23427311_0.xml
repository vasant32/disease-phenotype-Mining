<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVESThe purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These complications remain higher in elderly patients than in young patients, and decreasing their incidence is an important goal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated surgical factors in particular, including surgical time, blood loss and thoracotomy length.METHODSBetween January 2000 and September 2009, 567 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> surgery at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed the records of 119 patients who underwent lobectomy, aged 75 years or older, for possible postoperative complication risk factors.RESULTSThe patients' median age was 77 years (range, 75-88 years); there were 79 men and 40 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative or postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications developed in 41 (34.5%) patients, including 17 (14.3%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 10 (8.4%) with prolonged air leak, 10 (8.4%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e>, 8 (6.7%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, 4 (3.4%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, 2 (1.7%) with cerebrovascular disease and 1 (0.8%) with postoperative haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors for postoperative complications consisted of longer surgery time (P = 0.002), blood loss (P = 0.021) and undergoing surgery prior to May 2004 (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that surgery time (P = 0.041) and surgery prior to May 2004 (P = 0.008) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications.CONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrates that the quality of surgery is an important factor in determining the risk of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>lung inflammation</z:mp> are conditions that make <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> surgery difficult; a skillful and meticulous surgical technique is required in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
