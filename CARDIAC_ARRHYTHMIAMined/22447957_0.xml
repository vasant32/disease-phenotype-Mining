<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of CW AFl occurring after previous radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of CCW AFl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to compare CW AFl de novo vs. CW AFl occurring after previous CCW AFl RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 246 procedures of RF catheter ablation for AFl from January 2009 to January 2011 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and electrophysiological data were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they were in sinus rhythm at the beginning of the procedure, if they had concomitant/previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation, or if AFl was not ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients presented CW AFl (10.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ID AFl), including 10 CW AFl occurring after a previous RF catheter ablation for CCW AFl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time for recurrence after the previous procedure of CCW AFl RF ablation was 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were younger (61.6 ± 11 years) than patients with CW AFl de novo (74.0 ± 7.2 years; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional isthmus block was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in terms of double potential separation after ablation (155 ± 31 ms for CW AFl de novo vs. 111 ± 7 ms for recurrent CW AFl; P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed concerning CHADS score, AFl cycle length, and electrocardiogram typical pattern for CW AFl between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with CW AFl occurrence after CCW AFl RF catheter ablation are younger than patients with CW AFl de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They also have a smaller interspike interval after block completion </plain></SENT>
