<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increasing numbers of patients are receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>); the devices remain fully functional in most terminally ill patients at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of a terminally ill patient with repeated defibrillations who requested urgent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonmedical magnets available in the facility were used to deactivate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and terminate the defibrillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then studied various magnetic field sources commonly available in homes, such as ceramic magnets, cell phones, computer hard drives, headsets, and earbuds that potentially may be used to temporarily deactivate an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> until a device technician is available for reprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that commonly available magnetic sources may potentially be used to deactivate an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical usefulness of this is speculative and limited to conditions when the need to turn off the device is urgent, and a delay in reprogramming is anticipated </plain></SENT>
