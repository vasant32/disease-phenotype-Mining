<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> patients were included (six men, nine women, age 46 ± 19 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum electrolytes, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN) were measured before and after HDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained by Holter monitoring during HDF were used to produce the 3DECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several major disturbances were identified by 3DECG images: increase in QRS amplitude (47%), decrease in T-wave amplitude (33%), increase in heart rate (33%), and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> types were often concurrent and included isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature beats</z:e> (N = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262382" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial bigeminy</z:e> (N = 2), and isolated premature ventricular beats (N = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with decrease in T-wave amplitude had higher <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and BUN (both before HDF and total removal) than those without decrease in T-wave amplitude (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and gradual ECG changes during HDF are identified by the 3DECG, which could be useful as a preventive and prognostic method </plain></SENT>
