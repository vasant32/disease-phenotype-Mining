<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on high negative predictive value results of CCTA, we decide to evaluate our performance at HIMA San Pablo Bayamón </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For our study, 59 patients were selected based on history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> having an intermediate CAD probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 53 were accessible to interviewing and questioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As exclusion criteria, patients had to be over 19 years old, without a permanent pacemaker, persistent intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, history of contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e>, significant active COPD and having a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> below 1.5 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was performed with the Toshiba Aquilion 64 CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We searched retrospectively for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in this study such as unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, revascularization, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation was performed separately and as MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified in three categories: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, no significant and significant findings based on CCTA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical calculation of these results demonstrated no events in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> category, 10% in the nonsignificant and 25% in the significant category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our review of the efficacy of CCTA in patients in our setting in HIMA San Pablo Bayamón demonstrates an impressive negative predictive value of the test excluding significant cardiac events or MACE, which concurs with the recent literature about CCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The safety, ease of realization and short duration of the procedure makes this test an excellent technique to assess clinical prognosis </plain></SENT>
