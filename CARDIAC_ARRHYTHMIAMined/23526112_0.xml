<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the significant toll of the disease, more resources have been invested in developing new treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these medications, inhalational <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48873">anticholinergics</z:chebi> are widely used for the management of stable COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The newer agents, with longer half-lives and better safety profiles, have emerged and helped to improve management of COPD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available data from randomized clinical trials support use of these agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple randomized clinical trials show safety and efficacy of the newer long-acting inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48873">anticholinergics</z:chebi>, including tiotropium and aclidinium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis of tiotropium delivered with Respimat(Â®) raised some safety concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large trial, comparing different doses and delivery methods of inhaled tiotropium, is ongoing to determine the effect on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As clinical trials may not comprehensively represent the entire COPD population, caution should be exercised when these agents are used in higher-risk populations, like individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178879,C1561646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urinary obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
