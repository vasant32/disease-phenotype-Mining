<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one study has tested the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and it found no association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> and the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and complications to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In total, 258 patients were consecutively included from March 2009 to February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in- and out-patients in the Department of Cardiology at Hvidovre Hospital were invited to participate, provided they had electrocardiographically documented AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">terminal illness</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) was measured with a chemiluminescence assay (Liaison from DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association between <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> level and type of AF was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>Vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> was significantly associated with low age (p = 0.02) and gender with a higher proportion of females having the optimal level of 25 OHD (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Other studies have found a beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, but we found no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> and the type of AF or complications to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is necessary to determine whether <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: The study has received financial support from several private and one public fund </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the National Ethics Committee (Project-ID: H-C-2009-014) </plain></SENT>
