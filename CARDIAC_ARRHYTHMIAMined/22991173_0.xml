<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clenbuterol is a long-lasting β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> and was once medicated as a bronchial dilatator, and is also used by body-building enthusiasts and athletes and in livestock breeding because of its anabolic effect on skeletal muscles and ability to promote lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though prohibited from pharmacological uses, clenbuterol intoxication cases are frequently reported, and most of the cardiac symptoms are tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we reported a different cardiovascular toxic response to clenbuterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a rabbit model, we tested the dose-response pattern of the cardiovascular system to intravenous administration of clenbuterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Routine arterial blood pressure (BP) and surface electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that clenbuterol at a lower dose (0.4 mg/kg, n = 3) did not significantly affect the ECG, but decreased the mean BP roughly by 15-18 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a medial dose (3.6 mg/kg, n = 3), clenbuterol induced significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (mean BP dropped by about 30 mmHg), first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and intermittent ectopic activities with a relatively slow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recovered slowly, and animals did not die </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher-dose clenbuterol (10 mg/kg, n = 6) induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, second-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (Mobitz type II), 2:1 ventricular capture and progressive prolongations of P-R intervals and QRS duration, and the animals soon died of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Different from other reports, we had not observed lethal tachyarrhythmia in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments except for the slight heart rate acceleration during the recovery stage of medial clenbuterol dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravenous administration of clenbuterol has serious, dose-dependent cardiovascular toxicities and is even life threatening </plain></SENT>
