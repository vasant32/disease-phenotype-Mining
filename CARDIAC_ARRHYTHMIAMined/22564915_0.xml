<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An ectopic coronary artery that courses between the aortic root and the pulmonary trunk may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, especially in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that during exercise, compression of the coronary artery between the great vessels may impair coronary blood flow and produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis cannot be tested in humans, and little experimental data exist to explain this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, in a calf with an anomalous left coronary artery that coursed from the right sinus of Valsalva between the great vessels, we assessed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> during pharmacologically induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified a juvenile male calf (103 kg) with an anomalous left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva that coursed between the great vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Via thoracotomy, the animal was instrumented for hemodynamic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous dobutamine <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> and myocardial metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> produced arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and increased myocardial metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent-labeled microspheres were used to map regional myocardial blood flow, and hemodynamics were recorded during each condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Masson's trichrome staining for <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, wheat-germ agglutinin staining for myocyte size, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-label staining for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and isolectin-B4 staining for capillary density were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the first time, empiric data documented that an ectopic coronary artery produced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> during elevated myocardial metabolic demands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left coronary artery resistance increased in a cardiac cycle-dependent pattern that was consistent with systolic compression between the great vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and capillary density indicated that regional ischemic, inflammatory-mediated myocardial remodeling was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the proposed mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and support early surgical repair of coronary arteries that course between the aortic root and the pulmonary trunk </plain></SENT>
