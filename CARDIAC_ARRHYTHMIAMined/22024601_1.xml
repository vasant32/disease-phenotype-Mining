<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about survival and complications in this specific subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine predictors of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Pacemaker-related complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurring in patients receiving a first PM for conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> indications were systematically documented (the FollowPace registry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report describes 481 patients ≥80 years during a mean follow-up of 5.8 (SD 1.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 2 months 54 PM complications occurred in 47 patients (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 35 adverse PM events were reported in 33 patients (6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complication rates in patients ≥80 years were comparable with those for patients &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival rates were 86, 75, and 49% after 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, and were comparable with survival for age- and sex-matched controls from the general Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most patients died of non-cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age at the time of implantation, male gender, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, coronary pathology, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This large study of long-term cardiac pacing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in octogenarians and nonagenarians showed a cumulative 5-year survival of ~50%, which compares with that of age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a beneficial impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> pacing, restoring life expectancy to previous levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of PM complications during long-term follow-up is not infrequent with 18.1% of patients experiencing a PM-related complication during a mean of 5.8 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The complication rate was not higher than in younger PM patients </plain></SENT>
