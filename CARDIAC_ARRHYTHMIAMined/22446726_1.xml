<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and four consecutive patients with ST-segment-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) were prospectively enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CRP plasma concentrations were measured before reperfusion, 24 h after admission and at discharge with an ultra-sensitive latex immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRP concentration increased significantly during the first 24 h of hospitalization (2.4 ± 1.9 vs. 15.7 ± 17.0 mg/L; p &lt; 0.001) and persisted elevated at discharge (14.7 ± 14.7 mg/L), mainly in 57 patients with LVSD (2.4 ± 1.8 vs. 25.0 ± 23.4 mg/L; p &lt; 0.001; CRP at discharge 21.9 ± 18.6 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LVSD was significantly increased across increasing tertiles of CRP concentration both at 24 h after admission (13.2 vs. 19.1 vs. 51.5 %; p &lt; 0.0001) and at discharge (14.7 vs. 23.5 vs. 45.6 %; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated CRP concentration at discharge to be an independent marker of early LVSD (odds ratio of 1.38 for a 10 mg/L increase, 95 % confidence interval 1.01-1.87; p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of CRP plasma concentration at discharge may be useful as a marker of early LVSD in patients after a first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
