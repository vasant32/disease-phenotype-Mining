<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spectacular developments have taken place, in the last 10 years, in the device-based management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF may benefit from a device implanted with a view to: (1) resynchronise the pump function of a discoordinated failing heart or (2) prevent sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by automatic cardioversion or defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This "point-of-view" article reviews the large amount of information gathered in the past 10 years on the use of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT), with or without cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), and puts in perspective the advisability of using one, the other or both treatments in distinct patient subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is currently no strong scientific evidence supporting the systematic implantation of CRT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (CRT-D) instead of CRT pacemakers (CRT-P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plain common sense should limit the prescription of these costly and complicated devices to patients in need of secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> or, for primary prevention, in younger patients without major concomitant illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preferential choice of CRT-P for the remainder of ambulatory patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV is currently acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of insufficient data regarding the performance of CRT-P in patients presenting in NYHA functional class I or II, CRT-D is currently the device of choice for this sub-population </plain></SENT>
