<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This practice is exclusively a prerogative of the prison population; it is, however, only exceptionally found in this environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two cases of lethal inhalation of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="32879">propane</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="37808">butane</z:chebi> gas observed by us over a very short time occurred in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Toxicologic analyses were performed by means of gas chromatography (head space) and revealed a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="32879">propane</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="37808">butane</z:chebi> mixture in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens (heart blood, bile, and urine) except vitreous humor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> posthydrocarbon gas abuse is well known, the concentrations of the two <z:chebi fb="88" ids="24632">hydrocarbons</z:chebi> were sufficient to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by asphyxiation and were distributed (fairly) homogeneously in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> biological fluids and organs examined, a parameter permitting one to assume that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred within a relatively short period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of finding in vitreous humor and the trace amount in urine suggests that both men died very quickly </plain></SENT>
