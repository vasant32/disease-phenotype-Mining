<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an important consequence thereof, PUFAs can suppress <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, molecular details for the interaction between PUFA and ion channels are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have localized the site of action for PUFAs on the voltage-gated Shaker K channel by introducing positive charges on the channel surface, which potentiated the PUFA effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that PUFA mainly affects the final voltage sensor movement, which is closely linked to channel opening, and that specific charges at the extracellular end of the voltage sensor are critical for the PUFA effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because different voltage-gated K channels have different charge profiles, this implies channel-specific PUFA effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The identified site and the pharmacological mechanism will potentially be very useful in future drug design of small-molecule compounds specifically targeting neuronal and cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
