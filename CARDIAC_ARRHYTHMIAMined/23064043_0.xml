<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation is an effective treatment for medically refractory, disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation success may be limited in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pericardioscopic, hybrid epicardial-endocardial technique for AF ablation may be a preferred approach for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available using such an approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 1-year outcomes of a hybrid technique for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 101 patients underwent AF ablation using a transdiaphragmatic pericardioscopic, hybrid epicardial-endocardial technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed with 24-hour Holter monitors at 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptom severity was assessed at baseline and follow-up by using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean AF duration was 5.9 years; 47% were persistent and 37% were long-standing persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean left atrial size was 5.1 cm (range 3.3-7 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival was 66.3% after a single ablation procedure and 70.5% including repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Repeat ablation was required in 6% of the patients and antiarrhythmic drug therapy in 37% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quality of life improved significantly and was durable over 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, which occurred in the early postoperative period: one due to atrioesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and the second due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> without apparent cause by autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest series to date of a hybrid epicardial-endocardial, stand-alone ablation procedure using a pericardioscopic technique for the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>While respecting the identified complications, our results demonstrate a high potential for successful treatment in a challenging patient population with AF </plain></SENT>
