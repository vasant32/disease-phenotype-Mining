<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied prognostic values of clockwise and counterclockwise rotation on total, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), and subtype mortality using the National Integrated Project for Prospective Observation of Noncommunicable Disease and Its Trends in the Aged, 1980-2004 (NIPPON DATA80) database with a 24-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline in 1980, data were collected on study participants aged â‰¥30 years from randomly selected areas in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed 9067 participants (44% men; mean age, 51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 24-year follow-up, mortality was as follows: 2581 total, 887 CVD, 179 coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 173 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and 411 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with the use of the Cox model including biochemical and other ECG variables revealed that clockwise rotation was significantly positively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in men and women combined (HR=1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.83; P=0.013), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in men and in men and women combined (HR=1.49; 95% CI, 1.12-1.98; P=0.007 in men; HR=1.28; 95% CI, 1.02-1.59; P=0.030 in combined), and total mortality in men and in men and women combined (HR=1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.49; P=0.0496 in men; HR=1.15; 95% CI, 1.00-1.32; P=0.045 in combined) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Counterclockwise rotation was significantly inversely associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in men and women combined (HR=0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.96; P=0.017), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in men and in men and women combined (HR=0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.94; P=0.011 in men; HR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P=0.006 in combined), and total mortality in women (HR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant positive association of clockwise rotation and a significant inverse association of counterclockwise rotation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality in men and in men and women combined, independent of confounding factors including other ECG changes </plain></SENT>
