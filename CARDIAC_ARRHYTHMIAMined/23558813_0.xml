<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone (BZ) as quantified by late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a risk stratification tool, and is associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BZ has been measured by various methods in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed which BZ analysis best predicts inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during electrophysiological study (EPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LGE was performed in 47 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> referred for EPS to assess for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LGE data was analyzed for BZ quantification by 3 previously published methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Method I (BZ-I) used pixels 2-3 standard deviations over the mean of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, expressed as % of left ventricular mass, Method II (BZ-II, as described by Yan) and Method III (BZ-III, as described by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Schmidt</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EPS results were classified as negative (non-inducible) or positive (monomorphic VT - MVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 47 subjects-age 61.7 years, 72% male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During EPS, 20 patients were non-inducible and 18 had induced MVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction was not significantly different between non-inducible patients and those with MVT (34.1% vs. 28.5%, p = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BZ-I was significantly different (1.4% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.001), but not BZ-II (7.9% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.68) or BZ-III (2.7 g vs. 2.1 g, p = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only BZ-I was an independent predictor of EPS outcome after controling for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (OR 1.97 per % change, 95% CI 1.04-3.73, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates significant variability between the published methods for measuring BZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also, BZ-I is a stronger predictor of inducible MVT during EPS than ejection fraction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>BZ may be another LGE marker of elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
