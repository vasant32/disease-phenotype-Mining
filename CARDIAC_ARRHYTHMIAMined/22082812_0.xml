<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) originated from the pulmonary veins, and was maintained by irregular activations of the posterior left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had performed the box pulmonary vein isolation procedure for the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF associated with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> from 1999 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper evaluated the long-term results of this procedure over more than 6 years, and discussed the role of the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrium in maintaining AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients were examined after box pulmonary vein isolation procedure concomitant with solitary mitral valve surgery retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into two groups with or without the elimination of AF (AF group and non-AF group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disappearance of AF was determined by electrocardiography, and atrial function was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF and the recovery of atrial systolic function after surgery were evaluated over more than 6 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a total of 462.8 patient years of follow-up (range 6.3 to 11.5 years, mean: 8.9 Â± 2.7 years), AF disappeared in 77.3% of the patients (41/53) at 3 months and in 70.6% (36/51) of the patients at 6 years after the box pulmonary vein isolation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the preoperative variables, a long duration of AF and a large diameter of the left atrium were the predictive factors for recurrences of AF (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> even though we did not perform ablation towards the mitral valve annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The box pulmonary vein isolation procedure can terminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF associated with solitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e>, and maintain a sinus rhythm for more than 6 years in 70% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study implicates the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrium in maintaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
