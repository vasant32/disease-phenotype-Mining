<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The field of telemedicine provides the opportunity for highly individualized medical management in a way that has never been possible before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evolving medical technologies using cardiac implantable devices (CIEDs) with capabilities for remote monitoring permit evaluation of multiple parameters of cardiovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and risk, including cardiac rhythm, device function, blood pressure values, the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e>, and the degree of compensation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac risk, device status, and response to therapies can now be assessed with these electronic systems of detection and reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This document reflects the extensive experience from investigators and innovators around the world who are shaping the evolution of this rapidly expanding field, focusing in particular on implantable pacemakers (IPGs), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>), devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) (both, with and without defibrillation properties), loop recorders, and haemodynamic monitoring devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This document covers the basic methodologies, guidelines for their use, experience with existing applications, and the legal and reimbursement aspects associated with their use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To adequately cover this important emerging topic, the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology (ISHNE) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) combined their expertise in this field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We hope that the development of this field can contribute to improve care of our cardiovascular patients </plain></SENT>
