<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we assessed the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> by adenoviral expression of the human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (HRC(WT)) or mutant HRC (HRC(S96A)) in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total HRC protein was increased by âˆ¼50% in both HRC(WT)- and HRC(S96A)-infected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HRC(S96A) mutant exacerbated the inhibitory effects of HRC(WT) on the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients, prolongation of Ca(2+) decay time, and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, HRC(S96A) reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC(WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks, which was reduced by HRC(WT), was increased by mutant HRC(S96A) under resting conditions although there were no spontaneous Ca(2+) waves under stress conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic Ca(2+) transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in human carriers </plain></SENT>
