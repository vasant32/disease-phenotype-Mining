<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The damage of existing cells or the transplantation of foreign cells may disturb functional conduction pathways and may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although these conduction disturbances are easily accessible with the human eye, there is no algorithmic method to extract quantitative features that quickly portray the conduction pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that co-occurrence analysis, a well-established method for feature recognition in texture analysis, provides insightful quantitative information about the uniformity and the homogeneity of an excitation wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a first proof-of-principle, we illustrate the potential of co-occurrence analysis by means of conduction patterns of cardiomyocyte-fibroblast co-cultures, generated both in vitro and in silico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To characterise signal propagation in vitro, we perform a conduction analysis of co-cultured murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cardiomyocytes and murine 3T3 fibroblasts using microelectrode arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To characterise signal propagation in silico, we establish a conduction analysis of co-cultured electrically active, conductive cardiomyocytes and non-conductive fibroblasts using the finite element method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that co-occurrence analysis is a powerful tool to create purity-conduction relationships and to quickly quantify conduction patterns in terms of co-occurrence energy and contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We anticipate this first preliminary study to be a starting point for more sophisticated analyses of different co-culture systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, in view of stem cell therapies, we expect co-occurrence analysis to provide valuable quantitative insight into the integration of foreign cells into a functional host system </plain></SENT>
