<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The presence of early repolarization (ER) in inferior or inferolateral leads has been associated with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) has been proposed to underlie arrhythmogenesis in J-wave syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated specific electrocardiographic (ECG) markers including Tpeak-Tend interval and (Tpeak-Tend)/QT ratio that reflect TDR in subjects with ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The ECGs of 47 healthy individuals (43 males, mean age: 45.7 ± 13.1 years) with an ER pattern in lateral (n = 15) or infero-lateral leads (n = 32) who successfully completed an exercise stress test were analysed at rest, peak workload, and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ER pattern was defined as slurring or notching of the terminal part of the QRS complex (J-point) ≥ 1 mm, in at least two contiguous leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five age- and sex-matched healthy subjects without ER (28 males, mean age: 48.6 ± 10.2 years) served as comparative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ER displayed increased Tpeak-Tend interval in lead V(2), Tpeak-Tend dispersion of the precordial leads, and (Tpeak-Tend)/QT ratio in lead V(2) compared with those without ER in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three phases of the exercise test (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Tpeak-Tend dispersion and the (Tpeak-Tend)/QT ratio in lead V(2) were significantly increased at recovery phase compared with peak exercise only in subjects with ER (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among the studied ECG parameters regarding the ER location (lateral vs. infero-lateral), the ER type (slurring or notching), or the maximum J-point amplitude (≥ 1.5 vs. &lt;1.5 mm) at baseline ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with ER display an increased TDR that may be related to an increased arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
