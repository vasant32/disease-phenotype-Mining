<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biventricular pacing through the coronary sinus (CS) is effective for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this approach is not always feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although surgical epicardial lead implantation is an alternative, the technique may be deleterious in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, direct left ventricular (LV) endocardial pacing under local anesthesia may be an option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe our technique and analyze the results of direct LV endocardial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Fourteen patients with failed resynchronization via CS (April 2006-September 2011) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a femoral approach, we performed transseptal puncture and LV mapping, then fixed the active lead where the longest electrical delay was observed; the generator was placed in the anterior thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For resynchronization, eight patients with a device previously implanted through the upper veins received a single-chamber generator that was set to the VVT mode to sense the subclavian pacing spike </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients received a complete femoral resynchronization system with either a defibrillator or pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for 6-54 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LV lead was successfully implanted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and two died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one improved at least one New York Heart Association class and experienced improved left ventricle ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient with recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct LV endocardial pacing is safe and may be a less risky, more efficient alternative than surgical epicardial lead implantation for resynchronization via CS </plain></SENT>
