<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure often results in adequate pulmonary blood flow, thus eliminating the need for neonatal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the incidence of RV outflow-tract complications and mortality for this intervention is significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with retrograde snare-guided radiofrequency (RF) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in an attempt to improve accuracy and decrease procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for the period between March 2007 and May 2010 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with PA-IVS who presented to the catheterization laboratory for attempted RF <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific details reviewed included demographics, preprocedural echocardiographic (echo) data, procedural technique and complications, pre- and post-RV pressures and pulmonary valve gradients, need for surgical intervention in the neonatal period, and short- to medium-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven neonates with PA-IVS underwent RF <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> using a retrograde snare-guided technique during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary valve was successfully perforated and the wire snared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of 11 atretic valves were crossed on the first attempt with low energy (5 W × 2 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No episodes of tamponade or RV/PA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred as confirmed by echocardiogram performed immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no ductal spasm with retrograde catheter manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sequential dilation of the perforated valve was not necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RV pressures decreased from 169 % systemic before dilation to 93 % after dilation (p &lt; 0.001) with a residual pulmonary valve gradient of 16 ± 6 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight of 11 patients (73 %) were discharged without surgery at an average 16 days after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients required Blalock-Taussig shunts to augment pulmonary blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Femoral artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occurred in 4 of 11 patients treated with anticoagulation, and 2 patients had atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No other complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No preprocedural echo parameters predicted requirement for surgical shunt before hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Retrograde snare-guided pulmonary valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in infants with PA-IVS is safe and may decrease the incidence of significant procedural complications </plain></SENT>
