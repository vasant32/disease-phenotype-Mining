<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of clinical presentation and disease progression exists within <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) inadequately describes this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, a clear alternative has not emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article discusses and refines the concept of phenotyping desaturators in COPD and shows a possible pattern which could be used as a framework for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: COPD is a complex condition with pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that COPD phenotypes should be associated with clinically meaningful outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The innovation of COPD phenotyping is defined as COPD desaturators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sleep-related hypoxemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> are well recognized in COPD and the development of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These sleep-related changes predispose to nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, particularly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A more focused definition makes possible a classification of patients into two distinct subgroups for both clinical and research purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Establishing a common language for future research will facilitate our understanding and management of such diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even if different treatment strategies have different outcomes for these groups, we will have confirmation, or otherwise, of the clinical value of cluster analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This knowledge could lead to pharmacological treatment and other interventions directed to specific phenotypic groups </plain></SENT>
