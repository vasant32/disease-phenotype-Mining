<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To specify the relationship between content of total body water and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) of non-valvular etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pharmacological amiodaron cardioversion followed by amiodaron supportive anti-arrhythmic therapy was made in 76 patients (47 males, 29 females, mean age 58 +/- 8 years) with persistent AF of non-valvular etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made of the height, body mass, arm circumference, thickness of the lipocutaneous fold above the biceps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) and arm muscular circumference were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body composition was calculated according to Watson formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty three (70%) patients with recurrent AF had overweight or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body fat mass in patients with frequent (1 recurrence and more for 3 months) and rare AF recurrences did not significantly differ (24.4 +/- 10.6 and 30.0 +/- 13.8 kg, respectively; p = 0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total body water was significantly less (36.8 +/- 5.2 and 42.7 +/- 5.4 kg, respectively; p = 0.0009) in patients with frequent AF recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multifactor regression analysis showed that content of total body water, irrespective of gender and age, inversely correlates with an early AF recurrence (R2 = 0.24; beta = -0.49; p = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low content of body water is associated with a risk of early AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
