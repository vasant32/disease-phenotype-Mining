<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Certain forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> involve gross morphological changes to the myocardium that alter its hemodynamic loading conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes can ultimately lead to the increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, which together work to pathologically alter the myocardium's bulk tissue mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to changing the mechanical properties of the heart, this maladaptive remodeling gives rise to changes in myocardium electrical conductivity and synchrony since the tissue's mechanical properties are intimately tied to its electrical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon, called mechanoelectrical coupling (MEC), can render individuals affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> arrhythmogenic and susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden Cardiac Death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms of MEC have been attributed to various processes, including the action of stretch activated channels and changes in troponin C-Ca(2+) binding affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, changes in the heart post infarction or due to congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo> are also accompanied by shifts in the expression of various molecular components of cardiomyocytes, including the mechanosensitive family of integrin proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As transmembrane proteins, integrins mechanically couple the ECM with the intracellular cytoskeleton and have been implicated in mediating ion homeostasis in various cell types, including neurons and smooth muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given evidence of altered integrin expression in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> coupled with the associated increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, we argue in this review that integrin signaling contributes to MEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In light of the significant mortality associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and SCD, close examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> culpable mechanisms, including integrin-mediated MEC, is necessary </plain></SENT>
