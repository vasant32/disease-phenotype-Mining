<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While differences in side chain chemistry can impart different pharmacological or toxicological effects, for some compounds, e.g., <z:chebi fb="9" ids="1391">MDMA</z:chebi> (Ecstasy), alterations of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> part of the molecule impart other significant effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATSs are used both therapeutically and recreationally, with significant abuse and <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutically, these agents are mainly used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorders or aid in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicological effects include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, excitability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>.Traditional analytical methods to analyze <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi> include gas chromatography-mass spectrometry where derivatization is often required to facilitate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides sample preparation issues, it has been demonstrated that injection port chemistry in the GC can lead to misleading results with some members of the <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To circumvent these issues, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) offers the promise of a simpler sample preparation procedure and fewer analytical concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This chapter describes an LC-MS/MS technique for the analysis of 14 ATSs in blood, serum/plasma, and urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method is quantitative and has reporting limits in the low ng/mL range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrospray ionization is used in the positive ion mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two transitions for each compound are monitored along with ion ratios </plain></SENT>
