<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior infant studies have not systematically examined respiration rate and tidal volume influences on infant RSA or the extent to which infants' breathing is too fast to extract a valid RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore monitored cardiac activity, respiration, and physical activity in 23 six-month old infants during a standardized laboratory stressor protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On average, 12.6% (range 0-58.2%) of analyzed breaths were too short for RSA extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher respiration rate was associated with lower RSA amplitude in most infants, and lower tidal volume was associated with lower RSA amplitude in some infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RSA amplitude corrected for respiration rate and tidal volume influences showed theoretically expected strong reductions during stress, whereas performance of uncorrected RSA was less consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that stress-induced changes of peak-valley RSA and effects of variations in breathing patterns on RSA can be determined for a representative percentage of infant breaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, breathing substantially affects infant RSA and needs to be considered in studies of infant psychophysiology </plain></SENT>
