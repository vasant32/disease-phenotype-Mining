<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown if these patients also experience an increased perioperative complication risk at major vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total 665 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> underwent elective major vascular surgery (carotid endarterectomy, abdominal aorta repair, or lower extremity revascularization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e>, dialyses, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, thrombectomy, reoperation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) were defined as occurring within 30 days after surgery and were collected using medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypertensive BP response was defined as a difference between exercise systolic BP and resting systolic BP of more than 55 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypotensive BP response was defined as a drop in exercise systolic BP below resting systolic BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a hypertensive BP response during a preoperative exercise test (n = 66) showed a higher risk of early perioperative thrombectomy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.80 95% CI (1.24-6.33)] compared with patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BP response (n = 582) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a hypotensive BP response (n = 18) showed an increased risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [HR 3.69 95% CI (1.08-12.64)] and cardiac complications [HR 2.90 95% CI (1.02-8.19)] compared with patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BP response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with an abnormal BP response have more cardiovascular complications at elective major vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
