<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous study demonstrated adenovirus-HGF was effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first clinical safety study showed a positive effect in patients with severe and diffused triple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 12 Pigs were randomized (1:1) to receive HGF, which was administered as five injections into the infarcted myocardium, or saline (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The injections were guided by EnSite NavX left ventricular electroanatomical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The catheter-based injections caused no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During mapping and injection, alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB levels have no significant increase as compared to those before and after the injection in HGF group(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HGF group has high HGF expression with Western blot, less myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes by electroanatomical mapping (HGF group versus after saline group, 5.28 ± 0.55 cm(2) versus 9.06 ± 1.06 cm(2), P&lt;0.01), better cardiac function with Gated-Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">Photon</z:chebi> Emission Computed Tomography compared with those in saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological, strongly increased lectin-positive microvessels and microvessel density were found in the myocardial ischemic regions in HGF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intramyocardial injection guided by NavX system provides a method of feasible and safe percutaneous gene transfer to myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> regions </plain></SENT>
