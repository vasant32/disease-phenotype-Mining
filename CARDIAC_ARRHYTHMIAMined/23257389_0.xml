<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) is characterized by specific alterations on ECG in the right precordial leads and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> that may manifest as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major causes of BrS are mutations in SCN5A for a large subunit of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, Nav1.5, but a mutation in SCN3B for a small subunit of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, Navβ3, has been recently reported in an American patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: A total of 181 unrelated BrS patients, 178 Japanese and 3 Koreans, who had no mutations in SCN5A, were examined for mutations in SCN3B by direct sequencing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons and adjacent introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mutation, Val110Ile, was identified in 3 of 178 (1.7%) Japanese patients, but was not found in 480 Japanese controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SCN3B mutation impaired the cytoplasmic trafficking of Nav1.5, the cell surface expression of which was decreased in transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of the transfected cells revealed that the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> currents were significantly reduced by the SCN3B mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The Val110Ile mutation of SCN3B is a relatively common cause of SCN5A-negative BrS in Japan, which has a reduced <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current because of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> surface expression of Nav1.5.  (Circ J 2013; 77: 959-967) </plain></SENT>
