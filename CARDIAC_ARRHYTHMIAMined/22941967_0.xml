<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in this technique, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> mapping with circular catheters may miss a non-isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to reveal the incidence and clinical significance of a non-isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina after EIPVsI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 81 consecutive paroxysmal AF patients (age 61 ± 12 years, 56 men), in whom EIPVsI was successfully performed in one encircling line with the endpoint of the demonstration of bidirectional conduction block between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> and left atrium (LA) with the double-Lasso technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a successful EIPVsI, pacing from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina was performed and it captured the LA in 17 (21.0%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 19 ± 13 months, AF recurred in 13 (16.0%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox proportional analysis revealed that a non-isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina after the EIPVsI was a significant predictor (hazard ratio = 3.91, 95% confidence interval = 1.13-14.16, P = 0.03) of AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein mapping with the double-Lasso technique did miss the non-isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina after a successful EIPVsI, which was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after the EIPVsI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pacing from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina may be required to confirm the electrical isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> carina after EIPVsI with the double-Lasso technique </plain></SENT>
