<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The racemic mixture (MG-1(R,S)) and its S-enantiomer significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and possessed antiarrhythmic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The S-enantiomer displayed the greatest effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The R-enantiomer did not show antiarrhythmic or hypotensive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the antiarrhythmic and hypotensive effects of these compounds are related to their adrenolytic properties </plain></SENT>
