<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Left atrial volume is an important predictor of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and it can be assessed by several different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simpson's method is well accepted as a reference standard, although no standardization exists for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the estimations of left atrial volumes obtained by the Simpson's method with three other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients referred for CMR imaging between February 2007 and May 2010 were included in the study (47 males; mean age, 59.4±11.5 years; body mass index, 26.3±3.7 kg/m2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial volume measurements were performed using the Simpson's, biplane area-length, ellipse, and three-dimensional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were correlated using a Bland-Altman plot and linear regression models and compared by two-tailed paired-sample t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reader variability was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left atrial volume measurements using the biplane area- length technique showed the best correlation with Simpson's method (r=0.92; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantification values using the ellipse and three-dimensional methods were significantly different than values obtained using the Simpson's method (P &lt; 0.05, for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> methods showed excellent observer reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient &gt;0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The biplane area-length method can be used for left atrial volume measurement when the Simpson's method cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If these two methods are not feasible, then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methods are highly reproducible and can be used, but should not be used interchangeably for follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
