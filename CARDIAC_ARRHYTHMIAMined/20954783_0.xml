<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of relationship quality requires self-regulation of emotion and social behavior, and women often display greater effort in this regard than do men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, such efforts can deplete the limited capacity for self-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent models of self-regulation, resting level of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, quantified as high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), is an indicator of self-regulatory capacity, whereas transient increases in HF-HRV reflect self-regulatory effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test these hypotheses in marriage, 114 young couples completed measures of marital quality and a positive, neutral, or negative initial marital task, preceded and followed by resting baseline assessments of HF-HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Couples then discussed a current marital disagreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Resting HF-HRV was correlated with marital quality, suggesting that capacity for self-regulation is associated with adaptive functioning in close relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For women but not men, the negative initial task produced a decrease in resting HF-HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was mediated by the husbands' negative affect response to the task and their ratings of wives as controlling and directive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the subsequent disagreement discussion followed the negative initial task, women displayed increased HF-HRV during the discussion but a decrease when it followed the neutral or positive task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The valence of the initial task had no effect on men's HF-HRV during disagreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Negative marital interactions can reduce women's resting HF-HRV, with potentially adverse health consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Women's reduced health benefit from marriage might reflect the depleting effects on self-regulatory capacity of their greater efforts to manage relationship quality </plain></SENT>
