<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This-43-year-old (CMV positive, EBV negative) female patient underwent an orthotopic heart transplant with a (CMV negative, EBV positive) donor heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032768" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postherpetic neuralgia</z:e> in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's panel reactive antibodies had been almost undetectable on routine surveillance testing, and her surveillance endomyocardial biopsies apart from a few episodes of mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cellular rejection (treated adequately with steroids) never showed any evidence of humoral rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was complicated by multiple admissions for upper respiratory symptoms, and the patient tested positive for entero, rhino, and coronaviruses serologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During her last admission (seven months postoperatively) the patient developed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's endomyocardial biopsy done at that time revealed concentric intimal proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> resulting in near-total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> occlusion in the epicardial and the intramyocardial coronary vessels, suggestive of graft vasculopathy with no evidence of rejection, and the patient had a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
