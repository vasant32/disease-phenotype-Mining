<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate effects of selective I(TO) changes on AP shape and duration (APD), and on afterdepolarisations or abnormal automaticity with β-adrenergic-stimulation, using the dynamic-clamp technique in atrial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human and rabbit atrial cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation, and electrical activity recorded by whole-cell-patch clamp (35-37°C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dynamic-clamp-simulated I(TO) reduction or block slowed AP phase 1 and elevated the plateau, significantly prolonging APD, in both species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In human atrial cells, I(TO) block (100% I(TO) subtraction) increased APD(50) by 31%, APD(90) by 17%, and APD(-61 mV) (reflecting cellular effective refractory period) by 22% (P &lt; 0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interrupting I(TO) block at various time points during repolarisation revealed that the APD(90) increase resulted mainly from plateau-elevation, rather than from phase 1-slowing or any residual I(TO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rabbit atrial cells, partial I(TO) block (∼40% I(TO) subtraction) reversibly increased the incidence of cellular arrhythmic depolarisations (CADs; afterdepolarisations and/or abnormal automaticity) in the presence of the β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (0.1 μm; ISO), from 0% to 64% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ISO-induced CADs were significantly suppressed by dynamic-clamp increase in I(TO) (∼40% I(TO) addition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ISO+I(TO) decrease-induced CADs were abolished by β(1)-antagonism with atenolol at therapeutic concentration (1 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atrial cell action potential changes from selective I(TO) modulation, shown for the first time using dynamic-clamp, have the potential to influence reentrant and non-reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms, with implications for both the development and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
