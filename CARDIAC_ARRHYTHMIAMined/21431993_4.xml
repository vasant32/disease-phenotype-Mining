<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this large cohort study, increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was not found to be associated with bisphosphonate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, bisphosphonate even showed a protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> compared to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among bisphosphonate users has been reported; however, the results from these studies are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> associated with bisphosphonate use in older women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims database from May 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on women 65 years or older with newly diagnosed cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 10 code: M80, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38962">M81</z:chebi>) who had not previously taken any medications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bisphosphonate-exposed and non-exposed patients were followed until they were either diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 10 code: I48) or until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios and the 95% confidence intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was reported in 626 of the 120,319 patients (0.52%) treated with bisphosphonates and 66 of 9,863 patients (0.67%) treated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall hazard ratio for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the bisphosphonate-treated group was 0.52 (95% CIs, 0.29-0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with a medication possession ratio greater than 0.7, the hazard ratio was lower (HR 0.41, 95% CIs 0.23-0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2567">alendronate</z:chebi> showed a statistically significant protective effect against the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58-0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among older Korean women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, bisphosphonate was found to have a protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
