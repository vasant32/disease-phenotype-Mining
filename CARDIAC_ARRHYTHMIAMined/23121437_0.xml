<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many clinicians consider severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> to be a contraindication to pulmonary artery catheterisation, except during open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due to the perceived high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, although the true incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective study to estimate the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during pulmonary artery catheterisation in 380 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was seen in only one patient (0.26%), and this was successfully terminated by external defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were recorded and there were also no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during removal of the catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have therefore concluded that pulmonary artery catheterisation in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> is not associated with a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, allowing pulmonary artery pressure monitoring to be performed relatively safely in such patients </plain></SENT>
