<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, female sex is an independent risk factor for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> not only in congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndromes</z:hpo> but also in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndromes</z:hpo> which occur as adverse effects of existing drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent clinical and experimental studies suggest that the gender differences may stem, at least in part, from gender differences in cardiac repolarization process, that is longer rate-corrected QT (QT(C)) interval in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In women, QT(C) interval and arrhythmic risks in TdP alter cyclically during menstrual cycle, suggesting a critical role of female sex hormones in cardiac repolarization process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These gender differences in fundamental cardiac electrophysiology result from variable ion channel expression and diverse sex hormonal regulation via long term genomic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-genomic pathways, and sex differences in drug responses and metabolisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, non-genomic actions of <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> on cardiac ion channels likely to contribute to the gender differences in cardiac repolarization processes </plain></SENT>
