<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency-based transseptal puncture has been developed to reduce complications and improve precision of septal access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience utilising surgical diathermy-based transseptal puncture for MitraClip implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2008 and April 2010, 72 patients underwent MitraClip therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diathermy-assisted transseptal access was performed in 66 patients, under echocardiographic guidance, by manual contact of the diathermy blade with the Brockenbrough needle at the groin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rate of successful puncture, time from femoral vein puncture to transseptal access and rate of complications were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diathermy-assisted puncture was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time from femoral vein access to transseptal puncture was 16 ± 19 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one suboptimal septal puncture position (too low), and there was one coronary artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical diathermy-based transseptal puncture may be a safe and effective alternative to either conventional or RF-based septal crossing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It improves precision of the septal access and may reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technique is now routinely used at our institution for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MitraClip procedures </plain></SENT>
