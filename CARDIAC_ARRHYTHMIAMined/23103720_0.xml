<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classic cut-and-sew maze procedure is successful in 85-95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the technical complexity has prompted modifications of the maze procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the maze treatment performed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2001 until February 2009, 169 patients underwent a modified maze procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> at the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, surgical procedure and follow-up data were obtained by reviewing the medical charts and consulting with the referring physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the procedure as measured by AF recurrence was analysed with a repeated measurements model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quality of life of the patients was assessed with the SF-36 (a short-form health survey with 36 questions) questionnaire and compared with that of the general Dutch population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 169 patients who underwent a modified maze procedure, 163 had their maze procedure as a concomitant procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 4.7% (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of post-procedural AF recurrence varied significantly over time (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased left ventricular function, increased age and higher preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were predictors of AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quality of life, as measured with the SF-36 questionnaire, was comparable with that of the Dutch population for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> health domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant maze is a relatively safe treatment that eliminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the majority of patients, although the probability of recurrent AF increases with the passage of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Decreased left ventricular function, increased age and higher preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels are associated with an increased risk of AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
