<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are associated with comorbid illnesses like <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>, or advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it is tempting to blame a stimulant like <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> as a trigger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the literature does not support this idea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is no real benefit to having patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> limit their <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi> is a vasoactive substance that also may promote the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ingestion of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> (as coffee or tea) does not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even patients suffering a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> do not have an increased incidence of ventricular or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after ingesting several cups of coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large epidemiologic studies have also failed to find a connection between the amount of coffee/<z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> used and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, it does not make sense to suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, abstain from <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Energy drinks are a new phenomenon on the beverage market, with 30-50Â % of young adults and teens using them regularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Energy drinks are loaded with <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, sugar, and other chemicals that can stimulate the cardiac system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is an increasing body of mainly anecdotal case reports describing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or even <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> triggered by exercise plus using energy drinks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clearly, there must be more study in this area, but it is wise to either limit or avoid their use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moderate to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687132" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">heavy alcohol use</z:e> seems to be associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The term "holiday heart" was coined back in 1978, to describe patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> following binge alcohol use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is reasonable to recommend to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that they limit their alcohol use, although unfortunately this treatment will likely not completely resolve their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
