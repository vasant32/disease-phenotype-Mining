<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Cardiac extracellular matrix structure is largely under the control of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) whose activity maintains a balance between connective tissue synthesis and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMP gene polymorphisms, by modifying the level of gene expression, may affect atrial structural remodelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between MMP-1 and MMP-3 polymorphisms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 74 persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients who underwent electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both patient and reference control groups, identification of MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction according to standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distribution of MMP-1 and MMP-3 genotypes and alleles were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a 3-week follow-up period, 37 patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence significantly differed among groups (P = 0.0139) according to 5A and 1G allele presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurred in 62% of the patients carrying both 5A and 1G alleles (reference group) compared with no recurrence in patients carrying neither of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant relationship between MMP-1 and MMP-3 polymorphism and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrences in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that genetic factors contribute to determine arrhythmic recurrence rate in persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
