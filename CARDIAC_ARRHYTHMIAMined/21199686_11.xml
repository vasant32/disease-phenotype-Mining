<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that the combination of left atrial ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation and pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation is beneficial for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare GP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation alone for treatment of paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with paroxysmal AF were randomized to either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation using a circular catheter suitable for both mapping and ablation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group) or anatomic GP modification followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (GP+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were seen at monthly visits, and 48-hour ambulatory ECG recordings were obtained every 3 months for a predefined follow-up period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was freedom from AF or other sustained atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence 3 to 12 months postablation after one or two procedures, without antiarrhythmic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was documented in 18 (54.5%) patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group 4.7 ± 1.0 months after ablation, and repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation was performed in 7 (21.2%) of these patients 5.1 ± 1.1 months after the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was documented in 9 (26.5%) patients in the GP+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group 5.0 ± 1.3 months after ablation, and repeat ablation was performed in 6 (17.6%) of these patients 4.3 ± 0.5 months after the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, 20 (60.6%) patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group and 29 (85.3%) patients in the GP+<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group remained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free (log rank test, P = .019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Addition of anatomic GP modification to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation confers significantly better outcomes than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation alone during a follow-up period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
