<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinicaltrials.gov and US Food and Drug Administration websites were searched as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of CRT-D therapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy were enrolled in meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight randomized controlled trials characterizing 5674 patients were finally included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis found that CRT-D therapy was associated with significant improvement in clinical conditions [odds ratio (OR): 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.33-2.07] and a reduction in hospitalization (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.81) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.67-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although advantages of CRT-D therapy over <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy were obvious, the peri-implantation adverse events of CRT-D therapy remained to be concerns.CONCLUSION: Compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, patients receiving CRT-D therapy have favourable outcomes regarding improvement in clinical conditions, hospitalization rate, and overall survival, but at a significantly higher risk of peri-implantation adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future studies are warranted to optimize the clinical application of CRT-D </plain></SENT>
