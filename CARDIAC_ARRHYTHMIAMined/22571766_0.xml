<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mechanisms by which CaMKIIδ mediates disturbances in excitation-contraction coupling, are not exactly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, KN-93 (0.5 µmol/L), a CaMKII inhibitor, was administered before induction of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion in isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CaMKII�� and the sarcollemal Ca(2+)-cycling proteins, known to be activated during reperfusion, was analyzed using immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KN-93 reduced reperfusion-induced ectopic activity and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was lower in KN-treated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> phase, neither inotropic nor chronotropic effects were elicited by KN-93, whereas post-ischaemic contractile recovery was significantly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion increased the expression of CaMKIIδ and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-calcium exchanger (NCX1) proteins without any influence on the protein content of alpha 1c, a pore-forming subunit of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, inhibition of CaMKII normalized changes in the expression of CaMKIIδ and NCX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, CaMKIIδ seems to regulate its own turnover and to be an important component of cascade integrating NCX1, rather than LTCCs that promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion-induced contractile dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
