<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its receptors are intimately involved in the regulation of this carrier-mediated NE overflow in protracted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ET-1 system is often complex, sometimes involving opposing actions depending on which receptor subtype is activated, which cells are affected, and whether stimuli are endogenously generated or exogenously applied </plain></SENT>
