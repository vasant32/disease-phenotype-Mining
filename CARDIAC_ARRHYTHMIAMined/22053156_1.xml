<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Na channels are the source of excitatory currents for the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are the target for a class of drugs called <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> (LA), which have been used for local and regional anesthesia and for excitatory problems such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These drugs are prototypes for new <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug-binding site has been localized to the inner pore of the channel, where drugs interact mainly with a phenylalanine in domain IV S6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Drug affinity is both voltage- and use-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Voltage-dependency is the result of changes in the conformation of the inner pore during channel activation and opening, allowing high energy interaction of drugs with the phenylalanine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA drugs also reduce the gating current of Na channels, which represents the movement of charged residues in the voltage sensors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, drug binding to phenylalanine locks the domain III S4 in its outward (activated) position, and slows recovery of the domain IV S4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although strongly affecting gating, LA drugs almost certainly also block by steric occlusion of the pore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Molecular definition of the binding and blocking interactions may help in new drug development </plain></SENT>
