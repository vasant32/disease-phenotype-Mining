<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> frequently present with supreventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New antiarrhythmic therapies are needed that modulate the specific pathomechanisms underlying the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and may have a better safety-profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current review aims at discussing some novel as well as known cytosolic and sarcolemmal mechanisms involved in CaMKII-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> without being able to cover <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects known in the field </plain></SENT>
