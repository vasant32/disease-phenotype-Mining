<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In subsequent ECGs <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) with <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>-like pattern with positive R wave in leads: II, III and aVF what suggested <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> arising from right ventricular outflow tract were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonsustained VT was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced during EPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 2 unsuccessful sessions of ablation were performed in the right ventricular outflow area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exercise test provoked bidirectional VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> infusion provoked bidirectional nonsustained VT and the U wave amplitude augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Betablocker was initiated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient is free of symptoms, only single <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> is observed </plain></SENT>
