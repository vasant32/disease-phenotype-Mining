<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Integration of these different G-protein signals within pacemaker cells of the SAN is critical for proper regulation of heart rate and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, excessive parasympathetic signaling can be associated with sinus node dysfunction (SND) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our previous work has shown that one member of the regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein family, RGS4, is highly and selectively expressed in pacemaker cells of the SAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of parasympathetic signaling, RGS4-knockout mice have reduced basal heart rates and enhanced negative chronotropic responses to parasympathetic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RGS4 appears to be an important part of SA nodal myocyte signaling pathways that mediate G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (GIRK) channel activation/deactivation and desensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since RGS4 acts immediately downstream of M2 muscarinic receptors, it is tempting to speculate that RGS4 functions as a master regulator of parasympathetic signaling upstream of GIRKs, HCNs, and L-type Ca(2+) channels in the SAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, loss of RGS4 function may lead to increased susceptibility to conditions associated with increased parasympathetic signaling, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e>, SND, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
