<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human gene variants affecting ion channel biophysical activity and/or membrane localization are linked to potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism for many human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> variants remains undefined despite more than a decade of investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posttranslational modulation of membrane proteins is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Importantly, aberrant myocyte signaling has been linked to defects in cardiac ion channel posttranslational modifications and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recently identified a novel pathway for posttranslational regulation of the primary cardiac voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel (Na(v)1.5) by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a role for this pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> has not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation in human genetic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report an unexpected link between a short motif in the Na(v)1.5 DI-DII loop, recently shown to be critical for CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation, and Na(v)1.5 function in monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experiments in heterologous cells and primary ventricular cardiomyocytes demonstrate that the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility variants (A572D and Q573E) alter CaMKII-dependent regulation of Na(v)1.5, resulting in abnormal channel activity and cell excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In silico analysis reveals that these variants functionally mimic the phosphorylated channel, resulting in increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-triggering afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we report that this same motif is aberrantly regulated in a large-animal model of acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and in failing human myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identify the mechanism for 2 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> variants that affect Na(v)1.5 channel activity through direct effects on channel posttranslational modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose that the CaMKII phosphorylation motif in the Na(v)1.5 DI-DII cytoplasmic loop is a critical nodal point for proarrhythmic changes to Na(v)1.5 in congenital and acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
