<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism, however, has not been well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether bereavement is associated with an <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> (HR) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003929'>decreased heart rate variability</z:mp> that might contribute to increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 78 bereaved spouses and parents (55 women and 23 men; aged 34 to 87 years, mean 65) were studied with 24-hour Holter monitoring within 2 weeks of bereavement (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>) and at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their findings were compared to those from a nonbereaved reference group (52 women and 27 men) aged 33 to 91 years (mean 63.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the mean HR, atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and both time and frequency domain heart rate variability measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> bereavement was associated with increased 24-hour HR (mean ± SE, 75.1 ± 1.1 vs 70.7 ± 1.0; p = 0.004) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> variability, as indicated by lower standard deviation of the NN intervals index (median 45.4 vs 49.9, p = 0.017), total power (7.78 ± 0.10 vs 8.02 ± 0.09, p = 0.03), very low frequency (7.23 ± 0.09 vs 7.44, p = 0.046) and low frequency (5.76 ± 0.12 vs 6.16 ± 0.09, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, the bereaved had a significantly lower HR (p = 0.001) and increased standard deviation of the NN intervals index (p = 0.02), square root of the mean square of differences of successive intervals (p = 0.045), number of interval differences of successive NN intervals &gt;50 ms divided by the number of NN intervals (p = 0.039), low-frequency power (p = 0.02), and high frequency (p = 0.002) compared to the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study, the first to report 24-hour HR monitoring in the early weeks of bereavement, has demonstrated increased HR and altered autonomic function that might contribute to the increased cardiovascular events in early bereavement </plain></SENT>
