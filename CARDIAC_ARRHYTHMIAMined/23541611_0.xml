<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analysed histological markers of right atrial (RA) remodelling in CHD patients in order to provide some insights into impacts of age and overload duration on substrates of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five CHD patients who underwent initial cardiac surgery were enrolled (median age 18years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with dominant left atrial overload were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RA tissues resected from CHD patients during surgery were examined by means of histology and immunohistochemistry and compared with RA tissues from age-matched control hearts from post-mortem (n=22, median age 22years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient histories of preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> and echocardiography were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The greatest extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, the largest myocyte diameter and the longest capillary distance and the most CD45-positive cell infiltration was observed in CHD samples with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, followed by CHD without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and then control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> histological changes were correlated with age in CHD samples (r=0.462, 0.718, 0.529 and 0.447, respectively) with relatively steep and continuous manner, whereas only myocyte diameter was correlated with age in control samples (r=0.576) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RA dimensions and area obtained from echocardiography also correlated with histological markers in CHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dominant and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> RA overload due to CHD resulted in time-course related RA structural remodelling, which could provide the background for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overload duration, rather than age, seems to be a key factor for atrial histological degeneration in the cohort of CHD </plain></SENT>
