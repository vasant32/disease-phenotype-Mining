<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nurses noted that the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> was high when intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was infused via a peripheral site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital policy recommends a central vascular catheter, but this method is often not feasible because the drug is administered in emergent situations for short periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> in patients given peripherally infused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The literature, policy, and procedures for administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> were reviewed; the pharmacy was consulted; and a data collection tool was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tool was pilot tested and revised, and face validation was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected during a 6-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A convenience sample was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included a total of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each new infusion of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was considered a separate occurrence, for a total of 24 infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Various grades of <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> developed in 8 patients (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>Phlebitis</z:mp> developed at 12 of the 24 infusion sites (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving peripherally infused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> are at high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This complication may lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, additional medical intervention, delay in treatment, and prolonged hospitalization </plain></SENT>
