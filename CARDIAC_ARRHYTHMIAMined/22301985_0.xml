<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased utility of cardiac imaging, in particular cross-sectional techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>), will result in increased detection of the anomaly and its variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whilst in the typical form it is often haemodynamically insignificant, its discovery may have clinical significance nonetheless, and its mimics require exclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During cardiac development the anomaly results from a failure of the left anterior cardinal vein to obliterate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recognized anatomical variants include the absence of the right superior vena cava and of an innominate bridging vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typical drainage is to the coronary sinus, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of which may be the first hint to the anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical implications with respect to vascular access and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> are well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant minority drain into the left atrium, potentially creating a haemodynamically significant lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, differentiation from anomalous left upper pulmonary venous drainage via a vertical vein is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A newly discovered variant runs an intra-atrial course with subsequent typical drainage, and if not recognized as such, may be confused with a left atrial mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of 3D contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography has proven extremely helpful in characterizing anomalous vasculature, and we demonstrate how such techniques can help delineate the anomaly and differentiate from its mimics </plain></SENT>
