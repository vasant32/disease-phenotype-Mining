<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed an isolated continuous-waveform constant-current physiological stimulator that is powered and controlled by universal serial bus (USB) interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stimulator is composed of a custom printed circuit board (PCB), 16-MHz MSP430F2618 microcontroller with two integrated 12-bit digital to analog converters (DAC0, DAC1), high-speed H-Bridge, voltage-controlled current source (VCCS), isolated USB communication and power circuitry, two isolated transistor-transistor logic (TTL) inputs, and a serial 16 × 2 character liquid crystal display </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulators are designed to produce current stimuli in the range of ±15 mA indefinitely using a 20V source and to be used in ex vivo cardiac experiments, but they are suitable for use in a wide variety of research or student experiments that require precision control of continuous waveforms or synchronization with external events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The device was designed with customization in mind and has features that allow it to be integrated into current and future experimental setups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual TTL inputs allow replacement by two or more traditional stimulators in common experimental configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The MSP430 software is written in C++ and compiled with IAR Embedded Workbench 5.20.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control program written in C++ runs on a Windows personal computer and has a graphical user interface that allows the user to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of the device </plain></SENT>
