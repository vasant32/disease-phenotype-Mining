<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been repeatedly reported that female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> survive longer than males and that the difference is due to a lower rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the cardiac iron load as measured by T2* magnetic resonance imaging in 776 patients (370 males) examined at the National Research Council as part of an Italian cooperative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also established <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular ejection fraction values for our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> was higher in males than in females (105 males versus 69 females; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac T2* was significantly lower in patients with heart dysfunction (P &lt; 0.0001), but no difference was observed according to sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty males and five females had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their cardiac T2* was not significantly lower than that of patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (24 ms versus 26 ms; P = 0.381), nor was there a difference between sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Liver T2* was significantly lower in males and females with heart dysfunction compared to those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels were higher in patients of both sexes with heart dysfunction without significant differences between males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Males and females are at the same risk of accumulating iron in their hearts, but females tolerate iron toxicity better, possibly as an effect of reduced sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
