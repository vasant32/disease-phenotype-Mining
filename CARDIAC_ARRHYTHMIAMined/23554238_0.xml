<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to describe the birth outcomes and risk factors in isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp>) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medically recorded birth outcomes, maternal age, parity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> maternal diseases with related drug treatments and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>/multivitamin supplementation were evaluated in isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp> was based on the autopsy report or surgical description in the population-based Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities, between 1980 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The birth outcomes and exposures of 77 isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp> cases were compared with 38,151 controls without defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean gestational age at delivery (38.6 week) and birth weight (2992 g), rate of preterm birth (20.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> (23.4%) of cases with a female excess (59.7%) differed significantly from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mothers of cases had higher parity, higher prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e>/cardiac dysrhythmias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high doses of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> in early pregnancy associated with a reduced rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Conduction disorders</z:e>/cardiac dysrhythmias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of mothers may have a role in the origin of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp>, while high doses of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> in early pregnancy may reduce the risk of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>AVCD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
