<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible, percutaneous technique for the generation of nonreperfused myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Modeling nontreated MI has major importance in the development and preclinical testing of new therapeutic strategies for patients missing the time window suitable for revascularization following MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 31 male swine, nonreperfused MI was generated by permanent occlusion of either the LAD or LCX coronary artery using 900 μm Embozene™ microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were monitored for 90 min postocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surviving animals were followed up for 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6), 14 (n = 6), or 56 (n = 6) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the planned study session, contrast enhanced MRI, triphenyl-tetrazolium-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, and microscopic histopathology were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mortality rate in this study was 22.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 14 cases: premature ventricular complexes with (5) or without (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, 2nd degree atrio-ventricular block (1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MRI, TTC, and histology confirmed the existence of MI in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic pathology showed that the microspheres caused a practically total occlusion at the epicardial level of the coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were detected in one case, probably due to unintentional reflux of the microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microspheres retained in the coronary arteries did not cause any MRI artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The generation of nonreperfused MI is feasible by percutaneous injection of Embozene into the coronary artery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The MI model thus obtained is suitable for the purposes of MRI experiments </plain></SENT>
