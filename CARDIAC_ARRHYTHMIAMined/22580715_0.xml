<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is widely utilized in patients with drug refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> with systolic dysfunction (EF &lt;35 %) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction delay</z:e> (QRS duration &gt;120 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about polarity of pacing stimulation and the resultant differences in LV mechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The polarity of pacing was altered sequentially in 20 patients (73 ± 13, 16 males) with preexisting biventricular devices with potential choice of multiple vectors for pacing stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial unipolar or extended bipolar configurations were switched to bipolar configuration or vice versa, and echocardiographic images were acquired for off-line analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional and global LV longitudinal and radial mechanics were assessed selectively from the subendocardial and subepicardial regions with 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular capture by each vector configuration was confirmed by local lead capture and appropriate QRS alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unipolar pacing resulted in increased dispersion of LV regional endocardial strains with a higher base-to-apex gradients of longitudinal shortening strains (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LV longitudinal shortening strain magnitude was higher at LV base with bipolar stimulation in comparison with unipolar stimulation (-10.5 ± 10.5 vs. -4.2 ± 6.3, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a difference in the mechanical activation sequence of the LV between unipolar vs. bipolar pacing stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for CRT </plain></SENT>
