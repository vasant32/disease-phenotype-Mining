<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -Current recommendations require a QRS duration of â‰¥120ms as a condition for prescribing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) of ischemic origin, current indications for defibrillator implantation and QRS &lt;120ms may benefit from CRT in the presence of marked mechanical dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -Patients with intraventricular dyssynchrony on echocardiography were randomly assigned to CRT or dual-chamber defibrillator implantation (CRT-D and D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> arm, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the HF clinical composite response, which scores patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was the cumulative survival from HF hospitalization and HF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional secondary endpoint was the composite of HF hospitalization, HF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of 56 CRT-D patients showed an improvement in their clinical composite response at 1 year, compared with 9 of 55 D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients (41% versus 16%, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 16 months, the CRT-D arm showed a non-significant higher survival from HF hospitalization and HF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (p=0.077), and a significantly higher survival from the combined endpoint of HF hospitalization, HF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -In this comparison of CRT-D and D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, CRT improved clinical status in some patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, mild-to-moderate symptoms, narrow QRS duration, and mechanical dyssynchrony on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
