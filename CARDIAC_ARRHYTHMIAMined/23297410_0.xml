<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mutation in the tenth Ig-like domain of titin's spring region is associated with arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, a disease characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Titin is the first sarcomeric protein linked to arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize the disease mechanism, we have used atomic force microscopy to directly measure the effects that the disease-linked point mutation (T16I) has on the mechanical and kinetic stability of Ig10 at the single molecule level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation decreases the force needed to unfold Ig10 and increases its rate of unfolding 4-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that T16I Ig10 is more prone to degradation, presumably due to compromised local protein structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the disease-linked mutation weakens the structural integrity of titin's Ig10 domain and suggests an Ig domain disease mechanism </plain></SENT>
