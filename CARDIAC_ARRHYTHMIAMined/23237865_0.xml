<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the association between serum UA levels and the occurrence of VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we examined the relationship between serum UA levels and the appearance of VT in patients with LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 167 patients (110 males, mean age 67.4 Â± 12.7 years) with LVH detected by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into two groups based on whether VT was presented (defined by more than 5 beats, n = 27) or not (n = 140) by 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), the E/A ratio and deceleration time of transmitral flow velocity were assessed by echocardiography in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and UA were compared in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Echocardiographic findings did not show the difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, BUN and UA levels in the VT group were significantly higher than those in the Non-VT group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>eGFR was significantly lower in the VT group than that in the Non-VT group (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the UA level as an independent predictive factor for the occurrence of VT (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.2, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that serum UA level is a useful marker for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with LVH </plain></SENT>
