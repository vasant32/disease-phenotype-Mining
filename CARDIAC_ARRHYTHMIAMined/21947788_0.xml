<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients (n = 149, age ≥80 years) who underwent pacemaker implantation at a community hospital electrophysiology program from July 2008 through June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single-, dual-, and biventricular-chamber pacemakers and generator changes were included for analysis; cardioverter-defibrillator devices, temporary pacemakers, and loop recorders were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard procedures for implantation were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major complications were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, cardiac valve injury, coronary venous dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minor complications were defined as drug reaction, conduction block, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> or lead dislodgement requiring reoperation, peripheral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp>, peripheral nerve injury, and device-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mean age of implantation was 86 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no intraprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one major in-hospital complication (0.7%) and one minor in-hospital complication (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 30 days of implantation, there was an overall 5.4% rate of complications; four minor (2.7%) and four major (2.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a 30-day cardiovascular-attributable mortality of 0.7% and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality of 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a 5.4% rate of readmission within 30 days of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report of pacemaker implantations in the extreme elderly reveals rates of implant complications comparable to data from younger patient populations while experiencing a higher 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (that may be attributable to elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rates in this age group) </plain></SENT>
