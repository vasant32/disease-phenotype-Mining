<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an important risk factor for thromboembolic complications and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In AF, extensive electrical and structural remodeling of atrial tissue takes place with the main underlying mechanisms being <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years it has been shown, that beside conventional antiarrhythmic therapies, modalities aiming at reversal of atrial tissue derangement could be of some benefit in the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the main focus was oriented towards drugs such as angiotensin convertase (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data about the potential beneficial role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for AF treatment is continuously growing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is now evident that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> act on AF mainly through their pleiotropic and not their <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several retrospective trials have shown that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> exert antiarrhythmic effects in patients with AF, while data from prospective studies are still conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the definitive confirmation and explanation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>'s role in AF treatment is still missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Herein, the current patophysiological concepts providing rationale for the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in AF treatment as well as up-to-date data from retrospective and prospective clinical studies are reviewed and discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Particular attention is paid to various clinical settings such as primary prevention, secondary prevention (post-cardioversion) and postoperative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also present our own data regarding the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in prevention of the recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion </plain></SENT>
