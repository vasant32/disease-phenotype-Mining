<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To what extent silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is present in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that brief intermittent long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings at regular time intervals are more effective than short-term continuous ECG monitoring in detecting silent AF episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients who had suffered an ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and were without known AF underwent a 24 h continuous ECG recording and performed 10 s rhythm registrations using a hand-held ECG recorder twice daily for 30 days and when <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> symptoms occured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and forty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 0.9 (0-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 17 patients were diagnosed with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eight AF episodes were diagnosed in 15 patients using intermittent recording, out of which 22% where unscheduled symptom triggered episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients AF was diagnosed with both methods and in two patients AF was detected exclusively with 24 h Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in favour of the hand-held ECG was shown between the two methods (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total prevalence of AF was 6.8% and increased to 11.8% in patients â‰¥75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No AF was found in patients &lt;65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged brief intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> screening substantially improves the detection of silent paroxysmal AF in patients with a recent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and thus facilitates the detection of patients who should receive oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
