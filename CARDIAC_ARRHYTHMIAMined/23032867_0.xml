<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was developed to overcome lead failure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection problems</z:e> of conventional transvenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, lead migration of the initial design and inappropriate shock rates have raised concerns regarding its reliability and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the largest multicenter series to date of patients with the new device in comparison with a matched conventional transvenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> collective with focus on perioperative complications, conversion of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), and short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (50 male and 19 female; mean age 45.7 ± 15.7 years) received an S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in three German centers and were randomly assigned to 69 sex- and age-matched conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indication was primary prevention in 41 patients (59.4%) without difference between groups (34 control patients; P = .268) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 11 (15.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 25 (36.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in 10 (14.5%) in the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean implantation time was 70.8 ± 27.9 minutes (P = .398) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversion rates of induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were 89.5% for 65 J (15-J safety margin) and 95.5% including reversed shock polarity (15-J safety margin) in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Termination of induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was successful in 90.8% (10-J safety margin, device dependent) of the control patients (P = .815) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications were similar between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 217 ± 138 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 3 patients with S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were appropriately treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three inappropriate episodes (5.2%) occurred in 3 S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients due to T-wave oversensing, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with rapid conduction was the predominant reason for inappropriate therapy in conventional devices (P = .745) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> system can be implanted safely with similar perioperative adverse events compared with standard transvenous devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our case-control study demonstrates a 10.4% failure of conversion of induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> with the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> set to standard polarity and 15-J safety margin and comparable inappropriate shock rates during short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
