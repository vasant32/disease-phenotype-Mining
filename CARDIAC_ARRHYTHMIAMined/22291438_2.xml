<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Vernakalant is a novel, relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent for conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the safety and efficacy of vernakalant in converting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adults with AFL received either a 10 min infusion of 3.0 mg/kg vernakalant (n = 39) or placebo (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If AFL or AF persisted at the end of a 15 min observation period, a second 10 min infusion of 2.0 mg/kg vernakalant or placebo was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who had treatment-induced conversion of AFL to sinus rhythm for a minimum duration of 1 min within 90 min after the start of the first infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient in the placebo group met the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient receiving vernakalant (1 of 39, 3%) converted to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reduced mean absolute ventricular response rate occurred within 50 min in patients receiving vernakalant (mean change from baseline -8.2 b.p.m.) vs. patients receiving placebo (-0.2 b.p.m.) (P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A post-hoc analysis revealed that vernakalant increased AFL cycle length by an average of 55 ms, whereas the AFL cycle length was unchanged in the placebo group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no occurrence of 1 : 1 atrio-ventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Dysgeusia and sneezing were the most common treatment-related adverse events, consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vernakalant did not restore sinus rhythm in patients with AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vernakalant modestly slowed AFL and ventricular response rates, and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
