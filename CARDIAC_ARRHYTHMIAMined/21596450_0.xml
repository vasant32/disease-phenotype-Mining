<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are no studies on the long term clinical outcomes and complications in the adult patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo> with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reviews our experience with a limited group of adult survivors of PA/IVS seen in our adult congenital clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty adult patients with PA/IVS (1998 to 2009) were identified from Mayo Clinic adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical history and clinical outcomes were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at last evaluation was 29 years (19-39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> within the study period (1998-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 32 years (30-37 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent the Fontan operation, eight patients had a biventricular repair, and five patients remained with palliative shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required re-interventions in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tricuspid valve (TV) (n=5), pulmonary valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>)/conduit (n=6), and mitral valve (n=2) replacements were the most frequent re-intervention in the biventricular repair subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were present in 80% of the total cohort, the highest rate among Fontan repairs (n=7) and biventricular repairs (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 15% of the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although limited in number, the adult PA/IVS patients in this series continue to have high rates of morbidity and mortality, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and need for re-operations as the major causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with biventricular repairs had the highest re-intervention rate in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While this subset of patients might not be representative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult PA/IVS survivors, continued follow-up at centers with expertise in adult congenital cardiology is recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
