<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although cardiac dysfunction is widely accepted as the most common cause of mortality in Friedreich <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (FRDA), no studies have evaluated this since the advent of specific clinical and genetic diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of FRDA patients to determine cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> followed by a case-control analysis comparing characteristics of deceased patients with living, age- and sex-matched FRDA controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were cardiac dysfunction (59%), probable cardiac dysfunction (3.3%), non-cardiac (27.9%) or unknown (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred earlier in the disease course (median 29 vs. 17years respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were common causes of cardiac-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to living, matched FRDA controls, deceased patients had longer triplet repeat lengths and higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> did not differ between deceased and living patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac dysfunction was the most frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (59%), most commonly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were significantly more common in deceased patients compared to matched FRDA controls, while in contrast, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More research is needed to establish the clinical significance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in FRDA </plain></SENT>
