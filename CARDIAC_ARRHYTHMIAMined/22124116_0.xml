<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac hERG channels comprise two primary isoforms: hERG1a, which has a regulatory N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>) domain, and hERG1b, which does not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated, <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>-containing hERG1a N-terminal regions (NTRs) directly regulate NTR-deleted hERG1a channels; however, it is unclear whether hERG1b isoforms contain sufficient machinery to support regulation by hERG1a NTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, we constructed a series of <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> domain-containing hERG1a NTRs (encoding amino acids 1-181, 1-228, 1-319, and 1-365) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NTRs were also predicted to form from truncation mutations that were linked to type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> disorder associated with mutations in the hERG gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the hERG1a NTRs markedly regulated heteromeric hERG1a/hERG1b channels and homomeric hERG1b channels by decreasing the magnitude of the current-voltage relationship and slowing the kinetics of channel closing (deactivation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NTRs did not measurably regulate hERG1a channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A short NTR (encoding amino acids 1-135) composed primarily of the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> domain was sufficient to regulate hERG1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that isolated hERG1a NTRs directly interact with hERG1b subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that deactivation is faster in hERG1a/hERG1b channels compared to hERG1a channels because of fewer <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> domains, not because of an inhibitory effect of the unique hERG1b NTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A decrease in outward current density of hERG1a/hERG1b channels by hERG1a NTRs may be a mechanism for LQTS </plain></SENT>
