<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the impact of AF termination as a procedural endpoint and the termination mode on long-term clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients who underwent stepwise ablation for persistent AF were categorized into the AF termination by ablation group and into the electrical cardioversion (CV) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroups were also analyzed based on different termination modes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up assessment included early recurrence and sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During initial ablation, 33 patients (11.3%) were directly converted to SR, 166 patients (56.7%) were converted to atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) that subsequently restored SR with further ablation in 98 patients (33.4%), and a total of 162 patients (55.3%) underwent cardioversion due to persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison between termination by ablation and termination by cardioversion in patients exhibiting AF or AT revealed that no significant difference was observed in early recurrence (38.2% vs. 43.8%, P = 0.328) and SR maintenance (67.2% vs. 59.8%, P = 0.198) during the (23 Â± 7) months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even after repeat ablation, the SR maintenance continued to exhibit no statistical difference in above two groups (72.5% vs. 70.4%, P = 0.686) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of subgroups, however, demonstrated that patients with AF terminated directly to SR experienced better clinical outcomes than other subgroups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> present during ablation have been implicated in prediction of recurrence mode: AF or AT (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Termination as a procedural endpoint is not associated with favorable long-term SR maintenance in persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF methods that convert <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> directly to SR have, however, been linked with improved clinical outcomes, although conversions to AT may not be correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> observed during the ablation may be used to predict the recurrence mode </plain></SENT>
