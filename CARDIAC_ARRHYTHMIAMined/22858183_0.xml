<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> are occasionally observed during ischemic attacks in patients with vasospastic <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (VSA), there have been no studies to detect repolarization abnormalities using TWA analysis in these patients during the asymptomatic phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze modified moving average (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) TWA using Holter recordings in 40 patients with VSA and in 40 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of positive TWA was higher in the VSA group than in the control group (24 of 40 [60%] vs 0 of 40 [0%], p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of the maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> TWA was also greater in the VSA group than in the control group (68.6 ± 21 vs 34.0 ± 11 μV, p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the VSA group, although there was no significant difference in maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> TWA values between patients with multiple- and single-vessel spasm, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> had higher values than those without (83.0 ± 15 vs 65.9 ± 20 μV, p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> exhibited decreased values of maximum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> TWA compared with subjects not taking these drugs (73.8 ± 18 vs 59.5 ± 21 μV, p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high values and incidences of TWA events were observed in patients with VSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the VSA group, maximum values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> TWA were high in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> but decreased in those taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the patients with VSA during asymptomatic phases exhibit repolarization abnormalities leading to a potential risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
