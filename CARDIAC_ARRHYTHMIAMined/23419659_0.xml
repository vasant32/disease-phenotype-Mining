<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes 5 years follow-up results and predictors of success of CB ablation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF).METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 163 patients were enrolled with symptomatic, drug refractory PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with CB technique was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint of this consecutive single-centre study was first electrocardiogram-documented recurrence of AF, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFLAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five years success rate after single CB ablation was 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 70% of the patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complete PVI was achieved with a single 28 mm balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The univariate predictors of AFLAT recurrence were (1) size of left atrium, with normalized left atrium (NLA) ≥10.25 [hazard ratios (HR) of 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-2.56] when compared with NLA &lt;10.25 (35% vs. 53%, P = 0.0001) and (2) renal function, with impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;80 ml/min (HR of 1.26, 95% CI: 1.02-1.57) when compared with GFR ≥80 ml/min (45% vs. 53%, P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normalized left atrium ≥10.25 was the sole independent predictor for outcome (HR 2.11; 95% CI: 1.34-3.31; P = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Sinus rhythm can be maintained in a substantial proportion of patients with PAF even 5 years after circumferential PVI using CB ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of decline in freedom from AFLAT was highest within the first 12 months after the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008726'>enlarged left atrium</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> have lower outcome </plain></SENT>
