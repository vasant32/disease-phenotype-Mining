<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Several genome-wide association studies have identified rs2200733, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at 4q25 to be the most common chromosomal variant present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to explore the association of rs2200733 with AF through a systematic review and meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: An extensive literature search was performed on PubMed, and other databases using the key words "genetics" and "AF." Seven case-control studies evaluating the association via multivariate analysis were identified including a total of 83,335 subjects (10,546 with AF, 72,789 referent individuals without AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analytic estimates were derived using random effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> were examined in sensitivity analyses, and publication biases were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: At pooled analysis, there was a strong independent association between the variant rs2200733 and the risk of AF (OR 1.89 [95% CI 1.62-2.16], P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor allelic frequencies for SNP rs22000733 were significantly more prevalent in AF population than non-AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metaregression results revealed that country of descent (logOR 0.38, P = 0.45) or site of study (logOR: -0.16, P = 0.41) did not moderate the overall effect size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Variant rs2200733 on chromosome 4q25 independently confers increased risk of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding will aid in improving our understanding of AF pathophysiology, risk prediction, and stratification of treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
