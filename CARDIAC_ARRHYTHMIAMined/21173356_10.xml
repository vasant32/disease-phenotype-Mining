<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent clinical studies suggest that endurance sports may promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use an animal model to evaluate whether sustained intensive exercise training induces potentially adverse myocardial remodeling and thus creates a potential substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar rats were conditioned to run vigorously for 4, 8, and 16 weeks; time-matched sedentary rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiograms and in vivo electrophysiological studies at 16 weeks were obtained in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After euthanasia, ventricular collagen deposition was quantified by histological and biochemical studies, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of transforming growth factor-Î²1, fibronectin-1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, procollagen-I, and procollagen-III was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 cardiac chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 16 weeks, exercise rats developed eccentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and diastolic dysfunction, together with <z:mp ids='MP_0003140'>atrial dilation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, collagen deposition in the right ventricle and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> markers in both atria and right ventricle were significantly greater in exercise than in sedentary rats at 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> could be induced in 5 of 12 exercise rats (42%) and only 1 of 16 sedentary rats (6%; P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fibrotic changes caused by 16 weeks of intensive exercise were reversed after an 8-week exercise cessation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model, we documented <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> after long-term intensive exercise training, together with changes in ventricular function and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If our findings are confirmed in humans, the results would support the notion that long-term vigorous endurance exercise training may in some cases promote adverse remodeling and produce a substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
