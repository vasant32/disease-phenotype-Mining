<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel blocker flecainide and L-type Ca(2+) channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> on the voltage-gated fKv1.4ΔN channel, an N-terminal-deleted mutant of the ferret Kv1.4 K(+) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: fKv1.4ΔN channels were stably expressed in Xenopus oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage-clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drugs were administered through superfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: fKv1.4ΔN currents displayed slow inactivation, with a half-inactivation potential of -41.74 mV and a slow recovery from inactivation (τ=1.90 s at -90 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flecainide and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> blocked the currents with IC(50) values of 512.29 ± 56.92 and 260.71 ± 18.50 μmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blocking action of the drugs showed opposite voltage-dependence: it was enhanced with depolarization for flecainide, and was attenuated with depolarization for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the drugs exerted state-dependent blockade on fKv1.4ΔN currents, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> showed a stronger use-dependent blockage compared with flecainide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flecainide accelerated the C-type inactivation rate without affecting the recovery kinetics and the steady-state activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> also accelerated the inactivation kinetics of the currents, but unlike flecainide, it affected both the recovery and the steady-state activation, causing slower recovery of fKv1.4ΔN channel and a depolarizing shift of the steady-state activation curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that widely used antiarrhythmic drugs flecainide and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> substantially inhibit fKv1.4ΔN channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by binding to the open state of the channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, caution should be taken when these drugs are administered in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blockers to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
