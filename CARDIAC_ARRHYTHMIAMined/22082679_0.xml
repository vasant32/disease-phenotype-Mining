<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is a key negative-feedback regulator of the gp130 receptor that provides crucial signaling for <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and survival; however, an in vivo role of SOCS3 regulation on cardiac gp130 signaling remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated cardiac-specific SOCS3 knockout (SOCS3 cKO) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mice showed increased activation of gp130 downstream signaling targets (STAT3, ERK1/2, AKT, and p38) from 15 weeks of age and developed cardiac dysfunction from approximately 25 weeks of age with signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, SOCS3 cKO failing hearts had minimal histological abnormalities with intact myofibril ultrastructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ca(2+) transients were significantly increased in SOCS3 cKO failing hearts compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that Ser23/24 residues of troponin I were hypophosphorylated in SOCS3 cKO hearts before the manifestation of cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggested the presence of abnormalities in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity in SOCS3 cKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the contractile dysfunction, we found various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in SOCS3 cKO nonfailing hearts accompanied by a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine the contribution of gp130 signaling to the cardiac phenotype that occurs with SOCS3 deficiency, we generated cardiac-specific gp130 and SOCS3 double KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double KO mice lived significantly longer and had different histological abnormalities when compared with SOCS3 cKO mice, thus demonstrating the importance of gp130 signaling in the SOCS3 cKO cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate an important role of SOCS3 regulation on cardiac gp130 signaling in the pathogenesis of contractile dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
