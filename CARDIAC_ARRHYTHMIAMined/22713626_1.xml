<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the atrial action potential and refractory period, and thereby prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The atrial action potential normalises after 2-4 weeks of sinus rhythm, suggesting that antiarrhythmic drugs might not be needed beyond that period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated whether short-term antiarrhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion is non-inferior to long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled patients in a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint assessment trial between May 4, 2007, and March 12, 2010, at 44 centres in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were adults with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> undergoing planned cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After successful cardioversion, patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of six per centre to: no antiarrhythmic drug treatment (control); treatment with flecainide (200-300 mg per day) for 4 weeks (short-term treatment); or flecainide for 6 months (long-term treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was time to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients and clinicians were unmasked to group assignment and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was assessed in a core laboratory, members of which were masked to treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored for 6 months by daily telemetric electrocardiograph (ECG) and centrally adjudicated Holter ECG recordings whenever <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was noted in two consecutive ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyses were per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This trial is registered, number ISRCTN62728742 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: After assay sensitivity was established with 4-week follow-up data from 242 patients showing that flecainide was superior to no treatment (Kaplan-Meier survival 70·2%vs 52·5%; p=0·0160), the trial continued to compare short-term versus long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome occurred in 120 (46%) of 261 patients receiving short-term treatment and in 103 (39%) of 263 patients receiving long-term treatment (event-free survival 48·4% [95% CI 41·9-55·0] vs 56·4% [49·1-63·6]; Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference 7·9% [-1·9 to 17·7]; p=0·2081 for non-inferiority; margin prespecified at 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In a post-hoc landmark analysis of patients who had not reached the primary endpoint in the first month, long-term treatment was superior to short-term treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of difference 14·3% [5·1-23·6]; hazard ratio 0·31 [0·18-0·56]; p=0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Short-term antiarrhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion is less effective than is long-term treatment, but can prevent most recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
