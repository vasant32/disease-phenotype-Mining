<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Selective pharmacological activation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 1 receptor (A(1)R) is a promising new approach to achieve a potent block of atrioventricular (A-V)-nodal conduction without significant cardiovascular side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the cardiovascular profile of INO-8875, a highly selective A(1)R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, and to compare its properties with N-[3(R)-tetrahydrofuranyl]-6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22527">aminopurine</z:chebi> riboside (CVT-510), which has already been shown to induce negative dromotropic effects with minimal cardiovascular side effects in animals and in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose-response experiments in the isolated hearts of rats were used to evaluate the functional selectivity of INO-8875 for the slowing of A-V-nodal conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ventilated adult rats were used to study the effects of INO-8875, in vivo, on arterial blood pressure as well as on supraventricular electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo, INO-8875 (100 nM to 3 μM) progressively prolonged A-V-nodal conduction without reducing left ventricular function or coronary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, INO-8875 up to a dose of 50 μg/kg did not reduce the carotid arterial blood pressure (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INO-8875 (1-50 μg/kg) and CVT-510 (20 and 50 μg/kg) both induced a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and atrial refractoriness, as well as slowing of A-V-nodal conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, compared with CVT-510, the activity of INO-8875 was more pronounced in A-V-nodal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INO-8875 exhibited a greater duration of action, lasting up to 2.5 hours post dosing, whereas the effects of CVT-510 dissipated over 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INO-8875 demonstrates functional properties of a highly selective A(1)R <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INO-8875 exhibits an increased dromotropic effect and greater duration of action compared with CVT-510 </plain></SENT>
