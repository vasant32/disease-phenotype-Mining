<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Functional cross-talk between seven transmembrane (7TM) receptors can dramatically alter their pharmacological properties, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This represents an opportunity for the development of novel therapeutics that potentially target more specific biological effects while causing fewer adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several studies convincingly have established the existence of 7TM receptor cross-talk, little is known about the frequencey and biological significance of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate the extent of synergism in 7TM receptor signaling, we took a comprehensive approach and co-expressed 123 different 7TM receptors together with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R) and analyzed how each receptor affected the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>) response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To monitor the effect we used integrative receptor activation/signaling assay called Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (R-SAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this screen the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi>α receptor (TPαR) was the only receptor which significantly enhanced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>-mediated response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The TPαR-mediated enhancement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> signaling was significantly reduced when a signaling deficient receptor mutant (TPαR R130V) was co-expressed instead of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TPαR, and was completely blocked both by TPαR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and COX inhibitors inhibiting formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">TXA2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE: We found a functional enhancement of AT1R only when co-expressed with TPαR, but not with 122 other 7TM receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the TPαR must be functionally active, indicating the AT1R enhancement is mediated by a paracrine mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since we only found one receptor enhancing AT1R potency, our results suggest that functional augmentation through 7TM receptor cross-talk is a rare event that may require specific conditions to occur </plain></SENT>
