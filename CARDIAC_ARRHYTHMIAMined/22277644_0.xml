<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To characterize the electromagnetic field emitted by the electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) superDimension(®) Bronchus system (SDBS) and to determine whether current implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) systems are suitable for use in conjunction with SDBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The electromagnetic emission of the SDBS location board were measured using a field strength meter connected to a low-frequency (5 Hz-100 kHz) electric and magnetic field analyser; the static magnetic field was measured using a three-axis Tesla meter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A human torso simulator was used in the in vitro experiment: a <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> plastic box (61 cm length × 43 cm depth × 16.5 cm height) was filled with a semisolid gel and a 0.45% saline solution to provide electric conductance similar to tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were immersed 1 cm into the gel and connected with a dual-coil integrated bipolar pacing/sensing/shock lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tip and right ventricular coil of the lead were connected to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> simulator using low-impedance cables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system transmits electromagnetic waves of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 kHz frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum magnetic fields measured were B = 53 and 12 µT at location board plane and at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> plane, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Corresponding figures for the electric field were E = 16.6 and 4.4 V/m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> recorded any noise signal during the period in which the location board was switched-on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stored electrogram analysis confirmed the correct detection of simulated tachyarrhythmia and therapy delivery by every tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are compatible with ENB performed with SDBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They also suggest that these results may be extended to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> manufactured in compliance with current EN regulations </plain></SENT>
