<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GIRK channels are activated by a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate the electrical activity of neurons, cardiac myocytes, and β-pancreatic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in GIRK channel function have been implicated in the patho-<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of neuropathic pain, drug <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and other disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the pharmacology of these channels remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper we describe the development of a screening assay for identifying new modulators of neuronal and cardiac GIRK channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pituitary (AtT20) and cardiac (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1) cell lines expressing GIRK channels were cultured in 96-well plates, loaded with oxonol membrane potential-sensitive dyes and measured using a fluorescent imaging plate reader </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation of the endogenous GPCRs in the cells caused a rapid, time-dependent decrease in the fluorescent signal; indicative of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> efflux through the GIRK channels (GPCR stimulation versus control, Z'-factor = 0.5-0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected this signal was inhibited by addition of Ba(2+) and the GIRK channel toxin tertiapin-Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test the utility of the assay for screening GIRK channel blockers, cells were incubated for 5 min with a compound library of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel modulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ion transporter inhibitors such as 5-(N,N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29005">hexamethylene</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi> and SCH-28080 were identified as blockers of the GIRK channel at sub-micromolar concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the screening assay will be useful for expanding the limited pharmacology of the GIRK channel and in developing new agents for the treatment of GIRK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
