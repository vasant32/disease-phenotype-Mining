<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While associated with future cardiovascular events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) the influence of MF on interim quality of life (QOL) has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigate for associations between MF and validated indices of QOL in patients with HCM and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 56-HCM/n = 42-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) underwent LGE-MRI in addition to standardized testing for QOL using the disease-specific Minnesota Living With <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> (MLWHF) and the generic SF-12 questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LGE-MRI images were blindly analyzed for the presence and volume of MF using validated techniques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the population was 56.8 Â± 12.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MF was identified in 82 % of patients with HCM and 74 % of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with respective mean MF burdens of 20.0 and 13.7 % of the left ventricular mass (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QOL scores for those with HCM or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, as assessed by both MLWHF and SF-12, were not significantly different between those with versus those without MF, and showed no association with MF burden by quantitative signal analysis </plain></SENT>
