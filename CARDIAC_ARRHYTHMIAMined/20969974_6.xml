<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, lowering the defibrillation energy for AFl/AF is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study we applied low-voltage multiple-shock defibrillation therapy in a rabbit model of atrial tachyarrhythmias comparing its efficacy to single shocks and antitachycardia pacing (ATP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Optical mapping was performed in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (7 ± 5 to 17 ± 16 μM) was administered to promote sustained AFl and AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single and multiple monophasic shocks were applied within 1 or 2 cycle lengths (CLs) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed AFl (CL = 83 ± 15 ms, n = 17) and AF (CL = 50 ± 8 ms, n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATP had a success rate of 66.7% in the case of AFl, but no success with AF (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low-voltage multiple shocks had 100% success for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple low-voltage shocks terminated AFl at 0.86 ± 0.73 V/cm (within 1 CL) and 0.28 ± 0.13 V/cm (within 2 CLs), as compared with single shocks at 2.12 ± 1.31 V/cm (P &lt; .001) and AF at 3.46 ± 3 V/cm (within 1 CL), as compared with single shocks at 6.83 ± 3.12 V/cm (P =.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping revealed that termination of AFl was achieved by a properly timed, local shock-induced wave that collides with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> wavefront, whereas AF required the majority of atrial tissue to be excited and reset for termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Low-voltage multiple-shock therapy terminates AFl and AF with different mechanisms and thresholds based on spatiotemporal characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
