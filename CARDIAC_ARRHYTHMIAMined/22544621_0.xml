<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tablet splitting is a common practice for multiple reasons including cost savings; however, it does not necessarily result in weight-uniform half-tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine weight uniformity of half-tablets resulting from splitting 4 products available in the Jordanian market and investigate the effect of tablet characteristics on weight uniformity of half-tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten random tablets each of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> 5 mg, digoxin 0.25 mg, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> 30 mg, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 5 mg were weighed and split by 6 PharmD students using a knife </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting half-tablets were weighed and evaluated for weight uniformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other relevant physical characteristics of the 4 products were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average tablet hardness of the sampled tablets ranged from 40.3 N to 68.9 N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Digoxin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> half-tablets failed the weight uniformity test; however, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> half-tablets passed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digoxin, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> tablets had a score line and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> tablets had the deepest score line of 0.81 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Splitting <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> tablets produces weight-uniform half-tablets that may possibly be attributed to the hardness and the presence of a deep score line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Digoxin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> tablet splitting produces highly weight variable half-tablets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This can be of clinical significance in the case of the narrow therapeutic index medication digoxin </plain></SENT>
