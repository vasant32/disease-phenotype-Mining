<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A meta-analysis was performed to determine the risk and incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the general population with the early repolarization pattern (ERP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ERP has recently been associated with vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic significance of the ERP in the general population is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relevant studies published through July 31, 2012, were searched and identified in the MEDLINE and Embase databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies that reported risk ratio estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of interest were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were extracted, and summary estimates of association were obtained using a random-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 9 studies included, 3 studies reported on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (31,981 subjects, 1,108 incident cases during 726,741 person-years of follow-up), 6 studies reported on cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (126,583 subjects, 10,010 incident cases during 2,054,674 person-years of follow-up), and 6 studies reported on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (112,443 subjects, 22,165 incident cases during 2,089,535 person-years of follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk ratios of the ERP were 1.70 (95% CI: 1.19 to 2.42; p = 0.003) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.27 to 2.25; p = 0.63) for cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.28; p = 0.57) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated absolute risk differences of subjects with the ERP were 70 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> per 100,000 subjects per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>J-point elevation â‰¥ 0.1 mV in the inferior leads and notching configuration had an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in subgroup studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ERP was associated with increased risk and a low to intermediate absolute incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to clarify which subgroups of subjects with the ERP are at higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
