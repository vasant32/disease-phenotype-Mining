<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no drugs with a favourable harm-benefit balance in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fixed-dose combination of topiramate, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi>, an appetite-suppressant <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi>, has been refused marketing authorisation in the European Union, after being licensed in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no randomised controlled trials of topiramate + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> in the prevention of complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the three available placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with topiramate 46 mg per day + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> 7.5 mg per day for between 1 and 2 years lost about 6-8 kg more than patients who received a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About one-quarter of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was regained within a year after treatment discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The known adverse effects of the two drugs composing this combination are additive, and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> was not adequately studied during clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many women of child-bearing age would be exposed to this combination, which can provoke fetal abnormalities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, if taken during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In practice, the topiramate + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8080">phentermine</z:chebi> combination has an unfavourable harm-benefit balance and has no place in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
