<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different types of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> have been studied by analyzing the phenotype of cardiomyocytes generated from patient-specific iPSC lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major aspects of the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo>, like prolonged action potentials, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and the effects of pro- and antiarrhythmic drugs could be recapitulated in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the future, patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes might be used to screen for new drugs, to avoid unwanted drug side effects, and to deepen our understanding on the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
