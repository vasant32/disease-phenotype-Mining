<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare histology around steroid-eluting and non-steroid ventricular pacing electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In autopsied PM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients histopathological findings around the electrodes were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were studied, PM(58), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>(12), mean age 75.1 ± 9.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implantation-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> interval was 4.0 ± 3.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were cardiac (PM 52%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> 58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of atrial electrodes were attached to the endocardium and most ventricular electrodes were found in the myocardium (P ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum thickness of the fibrous electrode sheath was greatest for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> ventricular electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some electrodes were covered with fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, most frequently in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> ventricular electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fibrous sheath usually contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cells and in some cases particles of foreign material, foreign body giant cells, and haematogenous pigment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The tissue around steroid-eluting ventricle PM electrodes was compared with the tissue around the non-steroid-eluting ventricle PM electrodes; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, foreign material, giant cells being found more frequently around the steroid-eluting electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fibrous sheath was slightly thinner in the steroid-eluting electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The histology around four coronary sinus electrodes was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial electrodes were attached more superficially to the endocardium while PM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> ventricular electrodes were more frequently embedded in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The electrodes were covered by a connective tissue sheath as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This process persisted most frequently around <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> ventricular electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Only borderline differences were found between the histological findings around steroid-eluting and non-steroid-eluting PM ventricular electrodes </plain></SENT>
