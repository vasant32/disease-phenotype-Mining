<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the use of temporary epicardial pacing wires to diagnose and treat early postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in pediatric cardiac surgical patients and (2) to determine the predictive factors for the need of pacing wires for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data in a prospective, observational format from patients undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery between August 2010 and January 2011 at a single academic children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 157 patients met the inclusion criteria during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 157 patients, pacing wires were placed in 127 (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing wires were used in 25 patients (19.6%) for diagnostic purposes, 26 patients (20.4%) for therapeutic purposes, 15 patients (11.8%) for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and 36 patients (28.3%) for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Need for cardioversion in the operating room, presence of 2 or more intracardiac catheters, severely reduced ventricular ejection fraction, and elevated serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level at the time of operating room discharge were found to be independent predictors for the use of pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only complication noted in the cohort was a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin infection</z:e> at a pacing wire insertion site in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A permanent pacemaker was required in 8 (6.2%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with temporary pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the use of temporary epicardial pacing wires in approximately 30% of children after congenital heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found the need for cardioversion in the operating room, presence of 2 or more intracardiac catheters, severely reduced ventricular ejection fraction, and high serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> level at the time of discharge from the operating room to be independent predictors of the use of pacing wires in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
