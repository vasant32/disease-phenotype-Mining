<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma ANP, NT-proBNP, and hs-CRP levels were measured before and 3 months after PVI in 33 patients with PAF and 30 control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) NT-proBNP levels at baseline were significantly elevated in subjects with PAF compared with control subjects (296.8 ± 272.1 vs. 80.8 ± 69.1 pg/ml), but ANP and hs-CRP levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; NT-proBNP levels normalized 3 months after PVI, but ANP and hs-CRP levels did not change significantly; NT-proBNP levels at baseline in the recurrent group were markedly higher than those in the nonrecurrent AF group (572.7 ± 234.2 vs. 176.8 ± 188.7 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Cox stepwise multivariate analysis demonstrated that only elevated NT-proBNP level at baseline was an independent predictor of AF recurrence (p &lt; 0.001) after PVI among 13 variables, such as echocardiographic parameters, plasma ANP, NT-proBNP, and hs-CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cutoff value of NT-proBNP ≥ 423.2 pg/ml was a significant risk factor for AF recurrence (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated NT-proBNP level at baseline, but not ANP and hs-CRP, is a sensitive biomarker for early predicting AF recurrence in patients with PAF </plain></SENT>
