<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 80 patients (45 men; aged 69.5 Â± 13.4) with previously implanted anti-arrhythmic devices, a 64-slice CT (Aquilion-64) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 61 patients (76.3%), ECG gating was used (coronaries visualization) and in 19 patients (23.7%) without ECG gating (not coronaries visualization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 patients without ECG gating MSCT images were diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 37 (60.6%) patients of 61, there was no problem with gating process and image quality was diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 24 (39.4%) with visible spikes in the ECG-gating group, there were difficulties in differentiating the R spike from an artificial spike (unipolar pacing) by MSCT software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients (24.6%) after reprogramming, it was possible to obtain good quality images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nine (14.7%) patients, it was not possible to reprogram devices due to old unipolar leads, but in two cases (3.3%), ECG gating was corrected manually and good image quality was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven (11.5%) patients, it was not possible to perform ECG gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ECG gating process was identified as the main cause of the imaging problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bipolar leads working as bipolar pacing seem to be necessary to perform MSCT with ECG gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A unipolar system lead may cause serious problems with reconstructions </plain></SENT>
