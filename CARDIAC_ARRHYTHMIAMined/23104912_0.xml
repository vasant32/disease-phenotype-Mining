<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate how microstructural variations in cell arrangement and increased interstitial resistivity influence the spatial distribution of conduction delays and block in poorly coupled regions of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-dimensional 0.6 cm × 0.6 cm computer models with idealized and realistic cellular structure were used to represent a monolayer of ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gap junction connections were distributed around the periphery of each cell at 10 μm intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regions of source-load mismatch were added to the models by increasing the gap junction and interstitial resistivity in one-half of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> in cell shape and cell arrangement along the boundary between well-coupled and poorly coupled tissue increased variability in longitudinal conduction delays to as much as 10 ms before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of conduction block, resulting in wavefront breakthroughs with pronounced curvature at distinct points along the boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increasing the effective interstitial resistivity reduced source-load mismatch at the transition boundary, which caused a decrease in longitudinal conduction delay and an increase in the number of wavefront breakthroughs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microstructural variations in cardiac tissue facilitate the formation of isolated sites of wavefront breakthrough that may enable abnormal electrical activity in small regions of diseased tissue to develop into more widespread reentrant activity </plain></SENT>
