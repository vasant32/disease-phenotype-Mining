<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Facial electromyographic (EMG) and heart rate (HR) responses were monitored during exposure to empathy-inducing film clips portraying sadness, anger or happiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Self-reports were assessed afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In agreement with expectations, DBD adolescents with high CU traits showed significantly lower levels of empathic sadness than healthy controls across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> response systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between DBD subgroups significant differences emerged at the level of autonomic (not verbal or facial) reactions to sadness, with high CU respondents showing less HR change from baseline than low CU respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study also examined basal patterns of autonomic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting HR was not different between groups, but resting respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) was significantly lower in DBD adolescents with high CU traits compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results support the notion that CU traits designate a distinct subgroup of DBD individuals </plain></SENT>
