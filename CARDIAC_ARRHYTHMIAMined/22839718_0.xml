<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the use of Î²-adrenoblockers allows to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on first day after operation only in 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with developed disturbances of cardiac rhythm were characterized by high parameters of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) and substantial changes of activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of ascorbinic acid at the stage of preparation of patients to surgery and in first 24 hours after operation allowed to effectively prevent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and disturbances of cardiac rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A conclusion was made that inclusion of ascorbinic acid in drug therapy of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> could be recommended for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in postoperative period </plain></SENT>
