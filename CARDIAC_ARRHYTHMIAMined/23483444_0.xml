<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective To identify the frequency and levels of potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) in internal medicine wards and their association with patients' age, gender, length of hospital stay and number of prescribed medications; and to describe management of frequently identified major or moderate pDDIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Setting Internal medicine wards of two major tertiary care hospitals of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method Micromedex Drug-Reax system was used to screen patient's profiles for pDDIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was applied to determine the odds ratio for specific risk factors of pDDIs i.e., age, gender, hospital-stay and number of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measure Overall prevalence and prevalence of contraindicated, major, moderate and minor pDDIs; levels of pDDIs; frequently identified major or moderate interactions; and odds ratios for risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results Total, 188 interacting drug-combinations were identified that contributed to 675 pDDIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 400 patients, 52.8 % patients were presented with at least one pDDI (overall prevalence), 21.3 % with at least one major-pDDI, and 44.3 % with at least one moderate-pDDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 675 pDDIs, most were of moderate (63.6 %) or major severity (23 %); good (61.2 %) or fair (25.5 %) type of scientific evidence; and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (50.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most frequently identified major or moderate interactions resulted in 45.3 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pDDIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their potential adverse outcomes included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e>, nephrotoxicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reduction in therapeutic-effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was significant association of the occurrence of pDDIs with patients' age of 60 years or more (OR = 2.1; 95 % CI = 1.3-3.3; p = 0.003), hospital stay of 6 days or longer (OR = 2.6; 95 % CI = 1.5-4.5; p = 0.001), and seven or more number of prescribed medications (OR = 5.9; 95 % CI = 3.6-9.6; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion The present study has recorded a high prevalence of pDDIs in internal medicine wards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with old age, longer hospital stay and increased number of prescribed medications were at higher risk </plain></SENT>
