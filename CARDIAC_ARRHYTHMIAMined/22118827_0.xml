<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and the lack of data on AF and its management in the Asia Pacific highlight the need for a comprehensive prospective study of AF management in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this need, the REgistry on Cardiac rhythm disORDers (RecordAF-Asia Pacific [AP]) has been initiated to assess the management of AF in 8 countries across the Asia Pacific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RecordAF-AP is a prospective, observational survey of the management of recently diagnosed AF with 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients with AF, treated or not, were included in the registry; with data recorded prospectively during the follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,721 patients with AF were recruited, of whom 2,629 were eligible for evaluation (intent-to-treat population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At study inclusion, rhythm- and rate-control strategies were applied to 37% (n = 959) and 62% (n = 1,610) of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the rhythm-control patients were mainly prescribed class III agents (49%), class Ic agents (39%), or β blockers (except for sotalol; 35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate-control patients were mainly prescribed β blockers (except for sotalol; 57%) or cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving rate-control strategies were more likely to have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> and persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, those receiving rhythm-control strategies were more likely to have recently diagnosed or paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RecordAF-AP will provide much needed insight into the real-life management of patients with AF in the Asia Pacific region </plain></SENT>
