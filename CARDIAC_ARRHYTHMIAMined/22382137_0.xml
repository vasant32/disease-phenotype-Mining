<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) allows exact three-dimensional (3D) visualization of complex anatomical structures and serves in the planning and implementation of ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Post-procedural lesion visualization using cMRI can assess the success of ablation therapy and may distinguish potential complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Performing ablation directly in the MRI scanner, with the option of anatomical substrate imagining, exact catheter navigation and real-time lesion visualization, holds the promise of improving success rates and safety in the interventional therapy of simple and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
