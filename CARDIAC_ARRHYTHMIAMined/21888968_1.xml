<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Computational models of human atrial cells, tissues and atria have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell models, for atrial wall, crista terminalis, appendage, Bachmann's bundle and pectinate myocytes are characterised by action potentials, ionic currents and action potential duration (APD) restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principal effect of the ion channel remodelling of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and a mutation producing familial AF, was APD shortening at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical alternans was abolished by the modelled action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF induced gap junctional remodelling slows propagation velocity at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Re-entrant spiral waves in 2-D models are characterised by their frequency, wavelength, meander and stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For homogenous models of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, spiral waves self-terminate, due to meander to inexcitable boundaries, and by dissipation of excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF electrical remodelling in these homogenous models led to persistence of spiral waves, and AF fibrotic remodelling to their breakdown into fibrillatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An anatomical model of the atria was partially validated by the activation times of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of tissue geometry from clinical MRI, and tissue anisotropy from ex vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the homogenous model of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> atria, a single scroll breaks down onto spatio-temporal irregularity (electrical <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>) that is self-terminating; while in the AF remodelled atria the fibrillatory activity is persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The persistence of electrical AF can be dissected in the model in terms of ion channel and intercellular coupling processes, that can be modified pharmacologically; the effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, that can be modified by ablation; and the permanent effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, that need to be prevented </plain></SENT>
