<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 111 patients with MI in the previous 60 days (median, 27 [9;84] months) before inclusion (84 men, mean age 64.1 ± 10.5 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 46.6 ± 12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heart rate turbulence and mTWA were evaluated using 24 h ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was SCD, and the secondary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> from cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 12 months, 15 SCD and 8 non-sudden cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (including five fatal MI and three fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-survivors had significantly higher mTWA values (83 [74;165] vs. 79 [78;94] mcV, P= 0.002), absolute turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) values (0 [-0.005;0.01] vs. -0.01 [-0.013;-0.004], P= 0.004), and significantly lower absolute turbulence slope (TS) values (3.34 [2.10;4.83], vs. 3.82 [4.48;7.27], P&lt; 0.001) compared with survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with SCD, mTWA, and TO were significantly higher (92 [72;213] vs. 74 [65;86] mcV, P= 0.004 and 0 [-0.001;0.01] vs. -0.01 [-0.03;0.01], P= 0.007, respectively) and TS values were significantly lower (2.14 [1.10;4.56] vs. 4.41 [2.1;7.18], P= 0.005) than in patients with non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> parameters were significantly worse in non-survivors than in survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We defined cut-off values for increased risk of SCD: for TO = -0.005, relative risk (RR) was 12.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-38.2, P&lt; 0.001; positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) 28.3%, negative predictive value (NPV) 96.9%], and for mTWA &gt; 53.5 mcV at 100 b.p.m., RR was 5.01 (95% CI 1.5-17.0, P= 0.005; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 24.4%, NPV 93.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, mTWA &gt; 18.5 mcV at 05.00 AM significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality [RR 7.5 (95% CI 1.4-38.7), P= 0.01; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 19.6%, NPV 90.8%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients who died from cardiovascular causes, mTWA, and TO values were significantly higher and TS values were significantly lower than in survivors, and the subgroup with SCD was characterized by significantly increased mTWA and TO values and decreased TS values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>mTWA &gt; 53.5 mcV at 100 b.p.m. was an independent significant predictor of SCD and increased risk of SCD by five-fold </plain></SENT>
