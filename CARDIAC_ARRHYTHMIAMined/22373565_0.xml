<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To test the feasibility of a novel method to combine magnetocardiographic (MCG) estimate of ventricular repolarization (VR) and multiple monophasic action potential (MultiMAP) recording in spontaneously breathing rodents with percutaneous sub-xyphoid epicardial placement of a MCG-compatible amagnetic catheter (AC), ten Wistar rats (WRs) and ten guinea pigs (GPs) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under fluoroscopic control, the AC was moved until four stable MAPs were recorded (fixed inter-electrode distance of 1.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>36-channel DC-SQUID (sensitivity 20 fT Hz(-½)) were used for MCG mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAPs, differentially amplified (BW: DC-500 Hz), were digitized at 1 kHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AC pacing provided local ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAP duration (MAPd) was measured at 50% and 90% levels of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous MCG mapping and MultiMAP recording were successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average MAPd50% and MAPd90% were shorter in WRs than in GPs (26.4 ± 2.9 ms versus 110.6 ± 14.3 ms and 60.7 ± 5.4 ms versus 127.7 ± 15.3 ms, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VERP was 51 ± 4.8 ms in WRs and 108.4 ± 12.9 ms in GPs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MAP amplitude was 16.9 ± 4.5 in WRs and 16.2 ± 4.2 in GPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAP and MCG parameters of VR were in good agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals survived the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two also survived a second invasive study; one was followed up until natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous MultiMAP recording is minimally invasive, usually avoids <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277684" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">animal sacrifice</z:e>, is compatible with simultaneous surface MCG mapping and might be used for experimental validation of MCG VR abnormality, to study the arrhythmogenic potential of new drugs and/or animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
