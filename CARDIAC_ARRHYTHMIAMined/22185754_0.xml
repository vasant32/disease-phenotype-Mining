<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have demonstrated a clear reduction only in populations with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to compare the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on appropriate shocks between ischemic and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with an ejection fraction 35% or less who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and had follow-up for at least 1 month were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic and nonischemic groups were divided into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment and control subgroups and the occurrence of appropriate shocks was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of shocks was analyzed using negative binomial models to account for overdispersion of the "count" data (number of appropriate shocks) and an adjusted intensity rate ratio was calculated for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 676 patients were included, of which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> were used by 65% (329 of 506) of the ischemic and 42% (72 of 170) of the nonischemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of appropriate shocks was significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in ischemic (13.4% vs 20.9%; relative risk 0.64, P = 0.028), but not in the patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, although use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> lowered the intensity rate of appropriate shocks in ischemic patients (intensity rate ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.47), no such benefit was noted in the nonischemic group (intensity rate ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-4.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> reduced the occurrence and frequency of appropriate shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in ischemic but not in nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
