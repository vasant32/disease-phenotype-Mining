<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound contrast (UC) and low mechanical index real-time perfusion (RTP) in the haemodynamic and anatomic assessment of repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) at rest and during supine bicycle stress echocardiography (BSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with CHD (n = 51, median age 21.5 years) were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had compromised image quality, 20 (39%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and 10 (20%) had pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RTP was performed at rest and during BSE using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="31980">Definity</z:chebi> and Contrast Pulse Sequencing, with assessment of Doppler pressure gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (n = 27), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) atrial switch (n = 10), <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> arterial switch (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> (n = 4), Fontan (n = 4), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UC with RTP improved endocardial border definition, with increased number of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) segments visualized at rest (P &lt; 0.0001) and during stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV ejection fraction (EF) and RV fractional area change (FAC) were measurable at rest and peak stress, RV FAC correlating closely with same-day magnetic resonance EFs (r = 0.72; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>UC enhanced Doppler signals, enabling subpulmonary ventricular systolic pressure measurements at rest and stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In six patients, marked elevations of subpulmonary ventricular systolic pressure were detected with UC during BSE, and quantifiable ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse events occurred, other than transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: UC at rest and with supine BSE enables safe and comprehensive assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, haemodynamics, and biventricular functional and perfusion reserve in adolescents and young adults with surgically modified CHD </plain></SENT>
