<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with electrical injuries admitted to the emergency department between January 2006-2010 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases were evaluated by age, gender, source of electrical power (low-high voltage), seasonal distribution, ECG changes, laboratory findings, clinical care units, complications, and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four (57.1%) of the cases were exposed to low-voltage electricity (Group I), while 63 (42.9%) of the cases were exposed to high-voltage electricity (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases with electrical injuries were aged 26-45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty of the women (85.7%) were wounded by low-voltage while 58 of the men (51.8%) were wounded by high-voltage electricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, and CK-MB levels were higher and the level of calcium was lower in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications (pathologies due to fall from high levels, cardiac dysrhythmias, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">compartment syndrome</z:e>) and the mortality rate were higher in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In cases with high-voltage electrical injuries, cardiac complications, complications due to fall from high levels and the mortality rate increase in conjunction with the degree of the muscle damage </plain></SENT>
