<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies for preventing AF have been amply evaluated, but currently there are no clearly defined guidelines for treatment of AF after thoracic surgery.Methods The study was prospective and randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">Acebutolol</z:chebi> and diltiazem versus placebo were compared, among 117 patients postpneumonectomy or lobectomy at the Thoracosurgery Clinic, Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who were enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: those who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> (Group 1) or diltiazem (Group 2) and compared with patients without antiarrhythmic drugs (Group 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each group consisted of 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were continuously monitored postoperatively with 24 ECG (Holter monitor) in the intensive care unit.Results In patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> AF occurred in 5% compared with 23% of patients receiving diltiazem and 20% of patients receiving placebo (difference not statistically significant).Conclusions <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">Acebutolol</z:chebi> and diltiazem appear to have been non-effective for the treatment or prevention of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Side effects were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparison to diltiazem, however, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> had a beneficial effect on the circulatory system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who had received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> proved to have had fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> episodes and supraventricular ectopy during the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> can be useful, especially in patients with sympathetic activity dominance </plain></SENT>
