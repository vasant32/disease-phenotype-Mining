<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: TASER (TASER International, Scottsdale, AZ) conducted electrical weapons (CEWs) are commonly used by law enforcement officers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although animal studies have suggested that transcardiac CEW discharges may produce direct cardiac effects, this has not been demonstrated in human studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the incidence and outcomes of transcardiac CEW probe impact locations in a large series of actual CEW deployments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multi-center database of consecutive CEW uses by law enforcement officers was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case report forms were independently reviewed by three investigators to identify cases with paired probe configurations potentially producing a transcardiac discharge vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive analysis was performed and inter-rater reliability was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1201 total CEW uses, 813 included probe deployments and 178 cases had paired anterior probe impacts potentially capable of producing a transcardiac discharge vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represents 14.8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CEW uses (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.9-16.9%) and 21.9% of CEW uses in probe mode (95% CI 19.1-24.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inter-rater agreement was very good, with kappa = 0.82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in any cases (97.5% CI 0.0-0.3%) to suggest a cardiac dysrhythmia, including those with transcardiac discharge vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEW deployments with probe impact configurations capable of producing a transcardiac discharge occur in a minority of cases in field use conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of these cases, transcardiac or otherwise, produced immediately fatal dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data support the overall safety of CEWs and provide a benchmark estimate of the likelihood of transcardiac discharge vectors occurring in field use of CEWs </plain></SENT>
