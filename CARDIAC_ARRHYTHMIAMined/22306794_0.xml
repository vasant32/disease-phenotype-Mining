<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For unknown reasons, guideline-discordant practice is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine referring physicians' concordance with the primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We mailed a survey regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> guidelines and individual practice characteristics to a random national sample of 3000 physicians selected from the American Medical Association Masterfile-one-third each specializing in family medicine, internal medicine, and general cardiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four percent with correct contact information responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred ninety-five (28%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25%-30%) respondents never refer patients with the intent of consideration for a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, including 7% (95% CI 5%-10%) of cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twelve (15%; 95% CI 13%-17%) believe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> are required before a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> is indicated; 525 (36%; 95% CI 34%-39%) believe that an ejection fraction of &gt;40% warrants a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>; and 361 (25%; 95% CI 23%-27%) would refer a patient for a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> within 40 days of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, family practice physicians and physicians residing in the western United States most often provided guideline-discordant answers, while cardiologists and those who refer to an electrophysiologist most often provided guideline-concordant answers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary care physicians who manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients without referral to a subspecialist were not more likely to provide guideline-concordant answers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Answers discordant with the primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> guidelines were common, suggesting that referring physician beliefs are an important barrier to appropriate patient referrals for primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
