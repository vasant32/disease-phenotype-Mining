<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiology studies with ablation have good short-term success and an acceptably low complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The long-term outlook for this patient group is incompletely defined, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors that require special consideration in children include the need to limit the size, depth and number of lesions, and the radiation exposure incurred during fluoroscopy-guided catheters manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of cryoablation seems promising in limiting lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems clearly have been shown to reduce the radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, these advances in technology have helped to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that earlier intervention and newer operative techniques will reduce the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For those patients who still develop tachyarrythmias after cardiac surgery, the use of three-dimensional systems and other new technologies permits more efficient intervention in the electrophysiology laboratory </plain></SENT>
