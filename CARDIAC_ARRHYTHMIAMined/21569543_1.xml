<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients either had a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (with or without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (without a recent MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were with and without treatment with the class III antiarrhythmic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> over 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Danish Investigations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and Mortality ON <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> (DIAMOND) studies included 2627 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> at baseline, who were randomised to treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The competing risk analyses estimated the cumulative incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during the 42 months of follow-up to be 9.6% in the placebo-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-group, and 2.9% in the placebo-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard regression found a 42% significant reduction in the incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF when assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.82) and there was no interaction with study (p = 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-group, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly reduced to 5.6% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>-group the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was reduced to 1.7% with the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reduction was however not significant (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.30-1.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with left ventricular dysfunction the incidence of AF in 42 months was 9.6% in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and 2.9% in patients with a recent MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> significantly reduced the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared to placebo in the entire study group and in the subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the subgroup with recent MI was not statistically significant, but the hazard ratio was similar to the hazard ratio for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients, and there was no difference between the effect in the two studies (p = 0.89 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
