<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in persons aged 1-35 years in Denmark in 2000-06 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> certificates were read independently by two physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Patient Registry was used to retrieve information on prior medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> autopsy reports were read and the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was revised based on autopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 625 cases of sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), of which 156 (25%) were not autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 469 autopsied cases, 314 (67%) were SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common cardiac cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (13%); 29% of autopsied sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> cases were unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 45% of SCD cases, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was witnessed; 34% died during sleep; 89% were out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Highest possible incidence rate of SCD in the young was 2.8 per 100 000 person-years including non-autopsied cases of sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excluding those, the incidence rate declined to 1.9 per 100 000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A total of 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the young can be attributed to SCD, when including non-autopsied cases (autopsy ratio 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of SCD in the young of 2.8 per 100 000 person-years is higher than previously reported </plain></SENT>
