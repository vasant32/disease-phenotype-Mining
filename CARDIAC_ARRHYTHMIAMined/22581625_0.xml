<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population was 1762 men and women aged 75 years and over with confirmed AF who attended a randomization clinic for the Birmingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) study, a primary care based trial of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients self-completed the EQ-5D and SF-12 questionnaires, and a simple measure of disability (Rankin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular co-morbidities were collected and number of drugs used as an additional proxy for co-morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality-of-life outcomes were compared with general population samples of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On multiple regression, female gender, greater medication use, and disability were independently associated with lower QoL scores in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those in AF with a Rankin score â‰¥2 had lower QoL scores, while those with a Rankin score &lt;2 had higher scores than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing co-morbidity was associated with reduced QoL scores, with the EQ-5D and SF-12 Physical Component Score showing similar sensitivity to these associations, and the SF-12 Mental Component Score showing less sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the absence of co-morbidity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF has little impact on generic QoL in an elderly non-acutely ill population </plain></SENT>
