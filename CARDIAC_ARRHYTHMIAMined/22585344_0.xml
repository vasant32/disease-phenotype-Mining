<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current literature on JET has not focused on patients at the highest risk of both developing and being negatively impacted by JET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the overall incidence of JET in an infant patient cohort undergoing open cardiac surgery, to identify patient- and procedure-related factors associated with developing JET, and to assess the clinical impact of JET on patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a nested case-control study from the complete cohort of patients at our institution younger than 1 year of age who underwent open heart surgery between 2005 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>JET patients were compared with an age matched control group undergoing open heart surgery without JET regarding potential risk factors and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of JET in infants after open cardiac surgery was 14.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From multivariate analyses, complete repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.0, 95 % CI 1.12-3.57] and longer aortic cross clamp times (AOR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01-1.03) increased the risk of developing JET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with JET had longer length of intubation, intensive care unit stays, and total length of hospitalization, and were more likely to require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (13 vs. 4.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>JET is a common postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in infants after open heart operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both anatomic substrate and surgical procedure contribute to the overall risk of developing JET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Developing JET is associated with worse clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
