<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Flaxseed is an important source of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi> an essential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possibility that a supplementation of the diet with foods rich in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27432">alpha-linolenic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> and fiber (like flaxseed) has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The primary objective is to determine whether consumption of a diet rich in FLAXseed over a one year period has any beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>Peripheral Arterial Disease</z:hpo> (FLAX-PAD study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a single center, prospective, double blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at in 110 patients over 40 years old and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients will receive 30 g of milled flaxseed (or placebo) per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints are incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary measures include: requirement for surgical interventions, exercise and cardiopulmonary performance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, arterial sufficiency, blood pressure, inflammatory profile, platelet function, changes in drug dosage levels, as well as nutrigenomic and biomarker profiles in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recruitment and baseline examinations started in October 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline data of the 110 patients is shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FLAX-PAD will generate data on the safety, tolerability, cardiovascular efficacy and genomic response to a diet rich in flaxseed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It will determine the effects on primary and secondary events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>) as well as in secondary endpoints (exercise performance, blood pressure and circulating <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels) in patients with PAD </plain></SENT>
