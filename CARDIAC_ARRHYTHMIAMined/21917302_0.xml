<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, is a major independent cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, especially in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interest of Ddimer (DD) measurement for predicting CV risk has been suggested in some subgroups of patients with AF but little is known about the negative prognostic value of DD measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary aim was to assess whether DD measurement and monitoring could predict the occurrence of subsequent CV events, defined as MI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and arterial embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: It was a prospective observational study including patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall 425 patients (mean age 77years) were included and followed-up every 4months for a 16-months-mean duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this period, 26 patients experienced an endpoint of combined CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with DD lower than 334ng/ml had a very low risk of suffering of CV events (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who will suffer from a CV event had a higher DD value, just before the occurrence of the CV event, while patients without CV event kept stable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified a DD threshold defining at any time patients at low risk of CV event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with higher DD levels are at higher risk of CV events, even if they are receiving oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, DD measurement is relevant in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DD measurement and monitoring are useful to assess the risk of CV events in usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The implications of DD measurement on the choice and the intensity of the antithrombotic treatment remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
