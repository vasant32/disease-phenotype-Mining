<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In the literature, the average diagnostic yield of the implantable loop recorder (ILR) is reported to be 35% over an observation period generally less than 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of ILR during very prolonged observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients who had received one or more (in the case of battery exhaustion before diagnosis) ILR (Reveal/plus/DX, Medtronic Inc.) from 2001 to 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic ECG was classified according to the ISSUE classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 157 patients (87 males, 69 ± 14 years): 70 of these were followed up for ≥18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated cumulative diagnostic rates were 30%, 43%, 52%, and 80% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively; 26% of diagnoses were made after 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield was independent of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo>, number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo>, age, and gender; the median time to diagnosis of ISSUE type 1 patients was shorter than that of the others (4 [2;10] vs. 16 [6;23] months; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the observation period, 3 patients (1.9%) died and none suffered arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonging observation up to 4 years increased the diagnostic value of ILR in syncopal patients and was safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A quarter of patients diagnosed needed more than 18 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As consequence, when a strategy of prolonging monitoring is chosen, monitoring should be maintained even for several years until diagnosis is established </plain></SENT>
