<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients with symptomatic AF, catheter ablation is a commonly performed therapy for rhythm control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, accurate documentation of the changes in HRQoL for these patients is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper will review why HRQoL questionnaires are important in evaluating patient outcomes for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we discuss how the results of these questionnaires can influence the cost-effectiveness of AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may, in turn, affect healthcare resource allocation in favor of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, these questionnaires can provide additional information over traditional quantitative measures of AF burden in assessing post-ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By standardizing the way by which HRQoL is measured and reported, these questionnaires are valuable in evaluating this important patient-reported outcome in AF ablation trials </plain></SENT>
