<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary cardiac tumors</z:e> in children are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is not well-defined, and management plans vary widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed a retrospective single-center review of patients â‰¤21 years of age diagnosed with a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumor</z:e> between 1968 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were defined as: 1) sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>; 2) nonsustained and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT); 3) pre-excitation; and 4) sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> of any mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 173 patients were identified: 106 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009730'>rhabdomyoma</z:hpo>, 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibroma</z:hpo>, 14 <z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxoma</z:mp>, 6 vascular, 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo>, and 15 other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 7 months (prenatal to 21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 42 (24%) had clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibromas</z:hpo> were the highest-risk group, with VT occurring in 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0009730'>rhabdomyoma</z:hpo> patients, 10% had pre-excitation, and 6% had VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 6 years (1 day to 34 years, median 4 years), surgical excision was performed in 62 cases, with rhythm treatment being 1 of the indications in 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Post-operatively, clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were eliminated in 18 of these 20, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibroma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 24% of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumors</z:e>, VT being the most common type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical excision for VT associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009730'>rhabdomyomas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibromas</z:hpo> in selected patients is an important and effective management strategy in these patients </plain></SENT>
