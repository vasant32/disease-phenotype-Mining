<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only few data from the real-world use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> with limited electrocardiographic monitoring are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The investigators report the incidence, timing, and reasons for discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi>; maintenance of sinus rhythm; and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence patterns in 120 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF; n = 91) or non-isthmus-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (n = 29) treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> (400 mg twice daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rhythm control was assessed with serial 7-day Holter electrocardiography after 4 weeks and after 6 to 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After drug initiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> was discontinued in 19 patients (16%) because of inefficacy (n = 7 [6%]) or adverse events (n = 12 [10%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks, 44 patients (37%) had stopped taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> because of inefficacy (n = 27 [23%]) or adverse events (n = 17 [14%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 6 to 9 months, 25 patients (21%) had discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> because of clinical inefficacy (n = 16 [13%]) or adverse events (n = 9 [8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> was still used after 6 to 9 months in 32 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of sinus rhythm was achieved in 40 patients (33%) after 4 weeks and in 24 patients (20%) after 6 to 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversal from persistent to paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was observed in 23 patients, (29%) whereas progression from paroxysmal to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 6 patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversion from AF to non-isthmus-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was noted in 10 patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> is associated with frequent adverse events and moderate antiarrhythmic efficacy requiring discontinuation in most patients within the first 9 months of use, and there is a prevalent reversal from persistent to paroxysmal but also from paroxysmal to persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and from AF to non-isthmus-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
