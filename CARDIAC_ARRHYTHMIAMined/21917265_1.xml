<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine effects of sympathetic stimulation on repolarization to identify electrocardiographic markers of sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pigs underwent median sternotomy and bilateral thoracotomy to expose the stellate ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in T-wave duration, amplitude, repolarization vector, and time from peak to end (Tp-Te) were continuously monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 15 seconds of unilateral left or right stellate ganglion (LSG/RSG) stimulation, T-wave amplitude increased 6- and 4.5-fold, respectively, in lead aVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T-wave duration and Tp-Te both increased 200% during LSG stimulation but only 50% and 30%, respectively, with RSG stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During LSG stimulation, frontal and horizontal T-wave vectors, respectively, changed from 1.9° ± 22.8° and 333.8° ± 9.7° at baseline to 83.4° ± 3.9° (inferiorly) and 306.7° ± 1.8° (posteriorly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During RSG stimulation, frontal and horizontal T-wave vectors changed from 348.2° ± 21.6° and 333.8° ± 10.3° before stimulation to 280.7° ± 4.6° (superiorly) and 118.1° ± 5.6° (anteriorly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During stellate stimulation, T-wave vectors are displaced to angles specific for LSG activation (posteroinferiorly) or RSG activation (anterosuperiorly); T-wave amplitude, duration, and Tp-Te increase; and ST-duration decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Displaced repolarization vector and changes in T-wave morphometrics provide a novel marker of unilateral sympathetic nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
