<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of atrial GP stimulation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e>) on ventricular refractoriness, restitution properties and electrical alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 12 anesthetized dogs, two multiple electrode catheters were sutured at left and right ventricular free walls for recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potentials were recorded from six epicardial ventricular sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), action potential duration (APD) restitution properties and APD alternans were measured at baseline and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with baseline, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> significantly prolonged ventricular ERP and APD at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites and decreased their spatial dispersions (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> also significantly flattened ventricular restitution curves and decreased the maximal slope of restitution curves at each site (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APD alternans occurred at shorter pacing cycle length at each site during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> when compared with baseline (P &lt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> prolonged ventricular ERP, decreased the slope of restitution curves and delayed APD alternans, indicating that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> may exert a protective role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
