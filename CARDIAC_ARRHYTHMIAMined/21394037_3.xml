<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compounds used in pharmacological treatment has traditionally been divided into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel inhibitors, ��-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel inhibitors, and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, whereas newer multichannel blockers such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and ranolazine have been introduced later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was devoted to the evaluation of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pacing-induced in vivo model of AF in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic effects of well-known compounds such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, and ranolazine were confirmed in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, antiarrhythmic effects of different inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated small conductance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (SK) channels were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous application of 5 mg/kg of the negative SK channel modulator NS8593 reduced AF duration by 64.5%, and the lowest significantly effective dose was 1.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A dose-effect relationship was established based on 6 different dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic effect of NS8593 and other tested drugs was associated with an increase in atrial effective refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional role of SK channels was confirmed by 2 other SK channel inhibitors, UCL1684 and apamin, thereby confirming the hypothesis that these channels might constitute a new promising target for antiarrhythmic treatment </plain></SENT>
