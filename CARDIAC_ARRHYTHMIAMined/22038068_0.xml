<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the presence of glomerular macrophages, including one showing erythrophagocytosis, on renal biopsy in a 25-year-old patient with clinical presentation and laboratory changes consistent with HLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was marked by persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> for 2 months, pleural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, multiple organ dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, with demise after a 2-month hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive assay for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), marked hyperferritinemia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011900'>hypofibrinogenemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, elevated anti-nuclear antibody, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and decreased circulating NK cells by flow cytometry were compatible with the diagnosis of HLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the glomerular hemophagocytic macrophages, which have not heretofore been described in the kidney of a patient with HLH, may have contributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> manifest as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
