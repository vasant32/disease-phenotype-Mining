<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study followed 269 patients (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35%; QRS &gt;120 ms; New York Heart Association class III/IV) undergoing CRT with a defibrillator for 553±464 days after CRT with defibrillator implantation to assess for independent predictors of appropriate device therapy for VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline medication use, medical comorbidities, and echocardiographic parameters were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 4-year incidence of appropriate device therapy was 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazard model identified left ventricular end-systolic diameter &gt;61 mm as an independent predictor in the entire population (hazard ratio [HR], 2.66; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with left ventricular end-systolic diameter &gt;61 mm had a 51% 3-year incidence of VA compared with a 26% incidence among those with a less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264733" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dilated ventricle</z:e> (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with left ventricular end-systolic diameter ≤61 mm, multivariate predictors of appropriate therapy were absence of β-blocker therapy (HR, 6.34; P&lt;0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;20% (HR, 4.22; P&lt;0.001), and history of sustained VA (HR, 2.97; P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early (&lt;180 days after implant) shock therapy was found to be a robust predictor of hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HR, 3.41; P&lt;0.004) and mortality (HR, 5.16; P&lt;0.001.) CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CRT and a defibrillator, left ventricular end-systolic diameter &gt;61 mm is a powerful predictor of VAs, and further risk stratification of those with less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>dilated ventricles</z:hpo> can be achieved based on assessment of ejection fraction, history of sustained VA, and absence of β-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
