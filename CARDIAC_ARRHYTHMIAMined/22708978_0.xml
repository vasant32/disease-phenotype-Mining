<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to assess the trends in the use of ECV following published studies that had compared rhythm and rate control strategies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and the recommendations included in the current clinical practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The REVERCAT is a population-based assessment of the use of electrical cardioversion (ECV) in treating persistent AF in Catalonia (Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial survey was conducted in 2003 and the follow-up in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed a decrease of 9% in the absolute numbers of ECV performed (436 in 2003 vs. 397 in 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is equivalent to 27% when considering population increases over this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients treated with ECV in 2010 were younger, had a lower prevalence of previous embolism, a higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> factors indicated, in 2010, a higher proportion of NYHA â‰¥ II and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a reduction in the number of ECV performed in 16 of the 27 (67%) participating hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was an increase of 14% in the number of procedures performed in tertiary hospitals, and was related to the increasing use of ECV as a bridge to AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering the initial number of patients treated with ECV, the rate of sinus rhythm at 3 months was almost unchanged (58% in 2003 vs. 57% in 2010; p=0.9) despite the greater use of biphasic energy in 2010 and a similar prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed a decrease in the number of ECVs performed over the 7 year period between the two studies, this technique remains a common option for treating patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The change in the characteristics of candidate patients did not translate into better outcomes </plain></SENT>
