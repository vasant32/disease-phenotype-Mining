<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The improved outcomes for CHD resulted in an increased number of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> requiring distinctive ablation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with CHD (age 35 ± 19 years, 21 male) were divided into 3 complexity groups and underwent 43 radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures using the magnetic navigation system (including 7 redo ablations) in combination with the CARTO RMT system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 59 tachyarrhythmias were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients had surgical scar-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (25 focal, including 4 microreentrant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and 27 macroreentrant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four accessory pathways and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> were diagnosed and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 31 patients, ablation was successful, with an end point of noninducibility (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The success rate for CHD complexity of type I, II, and III was 50%, 88%, and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure and fluoroscopy time was 216 ± 101 minutes and 40 ± 34 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of radiofrequency applications was 42 ± 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major complications related to the procedures occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 67% remained free of recurrence during a mean follow-up of 26 ± 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence developed in 0%, 16%, and 45% of patients with CHD type I, II, and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the magnetic navigation system is feasible to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with reasonable success rates and good long-term outcomes in adult patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of the magnetic navigation system offers advantages in complex anatomic situations </plain></SENT>
