<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The smoking cessation medicine varenicline has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events compared with placebo in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases of cardiovascular events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and cardiac dysrhythmias, have been noted from spontaneous reporting systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarize and describe cardiovascular adverse reactions identified in a general population during intensive postmarketing surveillance of varenicline in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Observational prospective cohort study using prescription event monitoring methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient cohort was established from pharmacy dispensing data sent directly to the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> New Zealand patients prescribed varenicline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse cardiovascular events were identified from follow-up questionnaires completed by doctors, spontaneous reports and by record linkage to national datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events were organized into clinical groupings for further clinical assessment, and key cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> New Zealand patients dispensed a prescription for varenicline from 1 April 2007 to 30 November 2010 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 31 January 2011, the IMMP varenicline events dataset included a total of 172 adverse events in the IMMP circulatory System Organ Class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 48 reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e>, including 12 reports of MI and 8 reports of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two key cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> suggested that this may have been induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary artery spasm</z:e> secondary to varenicline treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 50 reports of hypotensive events, with two key cases having documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>/tightness, and a further 27 reports of dysrhythmia events, including two unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a series of cases of cardiovascular events in patients taking varenicline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whilst there were multiple confounding factors in some patients, key cases were identified that suggested a possible mechanism of dysregulation of blood pressure leading to vasospasm or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
