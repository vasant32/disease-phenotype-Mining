<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether alpha B-crystallin (CryAB), a heat shock protein, could prevent the arrhythmogenic effects of PM by preventing CaMKII activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CryAB was delivered into cardiac cells using a TAT-protein transduction domain (TAT-CryAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECGs were measured before and after tracheal exposure of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and each intervention in adult Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After endotracheal exposure of DEP (200 μg/mL for 30 minutes, n=11), QT intervals were prolonged from 115±14 ms to 144±20 ms (p=0.03), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> were observed more frequently (0% vs. 44%) than control (n=5) and TAT-Cry (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, DEP-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was not observed in TAT-CryAB (1 mg/kg) pretreated rats (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In optical mapping of Langendorff-perfused rat heats, compared with baseline, DEP infusion of 12.5 μg/mL (n=12) increased apicobasal action potential duration (APD) differences from 2±6 ms to 36±15 ms (p&lt;0.001), APD restitution slope from 0.26±0.07 to 1.19±0.11 (p&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) from 0% to 75% (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DEP infusion easily induced spatially discordant alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of DEP were prevented by TAT-CryAB (1mg/kg, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rat myocytes, while DEP increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and phosphated CaMKII, TAT-CryAB prevented these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CryAB, a small heat shock protein, might prevent the arrhythmogenic effects of PM by attenuating ROS generation and CaMKII activation </plain></SENT>
