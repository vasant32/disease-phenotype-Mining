<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this study, a meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to compare the rate of recurrent neurological events (RNE) between transcatheter closure and medical management of patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A significant controversy surrounds the optimal strategy for treatment of cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and coexistent <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE search with standard search terms to determine eligible studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjusted incidence rates of RNE were 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.1) events and 5.0 (95% CI: 3.6 to 6.9) events/100 person-years (PY) in the transcatheter closure and medical management arms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the limited number of comparative studies and meta-regression analysis suggested that the transcatheter closure might be superior to the medical therapy in prevention of RNE after cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy subgroups of the medical arm yielded a significantly lower risk of RNE within patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Device-related complications were encountered at the rate of 4.1 (95% CI: 3.2 to 5.0) events/100 PY, with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> being the most frequent complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After transcatheter closure, RNE did not seem to be related to the pre-treatment shunt size or the presence of residual shunting in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant benefit of transcatheter <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure was apparent in elderly patients, patients with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo>, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rates of RNE with transcatheter closure and medical therapy in patients presenting with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> were estimated at 0.8 and 5.0 events/100 PY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further randomized controlled trials are needed to conclusively compare these 2 management strategies </plain></SENT>
