<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping of intracellular Ca and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential Δψ(m) was performed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52260">Rhod 2-AM</z:chebi> and TMRE, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was mimicked by covering a portion of monolayer with a glass coverslip until loss of Ca propagation, and reperfusion was mimicked by removing the coverslip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NR was mimicked by culture in serum- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-free medium for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, NR monolayers: (1) sustained Ca oscillations during longer periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (19.2 ± 1.8 min vs 10.4 ± 1.4 min, p&lt;0.001); (2) had attenuated increases in Ca transient duration (CaD) and time decay constant (Tau) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; (3) had preserved conduction velocity (CV) during early reperfusion, leading to protection against reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>; (4) had minimal "rebound" decreased CaD and Tau during reperfusion; and (5) had no depolarization of Δψ(m) during IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NR attenuates IR <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> via (1) stable calcium cycling and (2) prevention of Δψ(m) depolarization during IR </plain></SENT>
