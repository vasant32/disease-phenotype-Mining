<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cre recombination activity was examined in Prrxl1-CreER(T2); Rosa26 reporter mice at various embryonic and postnatal stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregnant mice were treated with a single dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> at embryonic day (E) 9.5 or E12.5, and X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> staining was performed 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strong X-<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi> staining was observed in the somatosensory ganglia (e.g., dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia) and the first central sites for processing somatosensory information (e.g., spinal dorsal horn and trigeminal nerve-associated nuclei) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> was administered at postnatal day (P) 20 or in adulthood (P120), strong Cre recombination activity was present in the primary somatosensory ganglia, while weak Cre recombination activity was found in the spinal dorsal horn, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, principal sensory trigeminal nucleus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mouse line provides a useful tool for exploring genes' functions in the somatosensory system in a time-controlled way </plain></SENT>
