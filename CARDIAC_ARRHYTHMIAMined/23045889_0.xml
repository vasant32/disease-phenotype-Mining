<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 43 patients included into the study were hospitalised in The Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology and received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> together over 400 bilateral electroconvulsive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients (N = 25) were qualified for electroconvulsive therapy due to treatment resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (58.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients: 2 with catatonia and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had life saving indications for electroconvulsive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (7%) were excluded from electroconvulsive therapy, following 1 or 2 electroconvulsive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty patients continued electroconvulsive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no complications and serious adverse events in patients who continued electroconvulsive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally, electroconvulsive therapy was well tolerated and treatment had been cut down in only one case due to adverse events and high risk related to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (10% of patients) were the most often occurring adverse events and patients (35%) mostly reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed remission in 22 patients (58%) and improvement in 14 patients (35%) following electroconvulsive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients (10%) had no benefit after a series of electroconvulsive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Electroconvulsive treatment was most effective in patients with catatonia (80% patients had full recovery) and in depressive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> (73% patients had full recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electroconvulsive procedures were safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Electroconvulsive treatment was most effective in catatonic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and in depressive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
