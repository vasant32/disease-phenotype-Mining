<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to investigate the electropharmacological activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on human HCN channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>hHCN channels were expressed in oocytes and studied using the standard two-electrode voltage-clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> blocks hHCN channels heterologously expressed in the Xenopus oocytes in a concentration- and use-dependent manner, but doesn't modify the voltage dependence of activation and reversal potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And the removal of blockage of HCN channels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was favored by inward current flow, not by hyperpolarizing potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of blockage on hHCN channels were consistent with those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> as "trapped" drugs on human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results will be useful for elucidating the potentially antiarrhythmic mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
