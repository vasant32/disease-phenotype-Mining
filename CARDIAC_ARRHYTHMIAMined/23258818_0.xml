<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We developed a textile-based wearable system, named MagIC, for the unobtrusive monitoring of one electrocardiogram (ECG) lead, respiratory frequency and motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the ability of this system to monitor cardiac rhythm and arrhythmic events in cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was carried out by comparing ECG tracings simultaneously recorded by MagIC and traditional ECG devices (Trad-ECG) in 40 cardiac patients at rest and during physical exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were manually scored by two cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At rest the artefact rates observed with MagIC and Trad-ECG were virtually identical (1.4% of the registered signal); while during physical exercise the artefact rate observed with MagIC was much lower than with Trad-ECG (4.07 vs. 17.31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recordings from MagIC allowed a correct identification of the type of rhythm in the vast majority of patients (92.5%) and an estimation of PQ interval and QRS duration similar to Trad-ECG (&lt;0.016 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MagIC displayed a good performance in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with only 14 misclassified events out of 3618, and both specificity and sensitivity being above 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No practical difference was observed in the estimation of the beat-by-beat RR interval by the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates that in static condition MagIC has a capability of monitoring cardiac rhythm and arrhythmic events which is comparable with what obtainable by a traditional one-lead ECG recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During movement MagIC provides an ECG signal of better quality </plain></SENT>
