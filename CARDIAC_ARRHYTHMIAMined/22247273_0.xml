<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there is no conclusive evidence to support the superiority of CLS over the conventional algorithms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of CLS pacing compared with dual-chamber pacing with conventional specialized sensing and pacing algorithms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> prevention in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with refractory VVS and a cardioinhibitory response to HUTT during a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one patients (44% male, 53 ± 16 years) with recurrent, refractory VVS (26% with trauma) and a cardioinhibitory response to HUTT who had undergone pacemaker implantation were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients received a dual-chamber CLS pacemaker (CLS group) and 16 patients received a dual-chamber pacemaker with conventional algorithms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> prevention (conventional pacing group): 9 patients with Medtronic rate drop response algorithm and 7 patients with Guidant-Boston Scientific sudden brady response algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up (mean 4.4 ± 3.0 years, interquartile range 2.2-7.4 years) one patient (4%) in the CLS group and six (38%) in the conventional pacing group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurrences (P= 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier actuarial estimate of first recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> after 8 years was 4% in the CLS group and 40% in the conventional pacing group (P= 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis show that, in order to prevent a recurrence of VVS in patients with a cardioinhibitory response to HUTT, dual-chamber CLS pacing was more effective than dual-chamber pacing with conventional algorithms for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> prevention in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
