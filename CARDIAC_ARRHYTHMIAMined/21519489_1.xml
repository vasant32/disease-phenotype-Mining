<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> with a population prevalence of about 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level is elevated in patients with AF with diastolic dysfunction even with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) level and Doppler echocardiographic parameters for diastolic function have shown correlation with LV filling pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the relationship between echocardiographic parameters and serum NT-proBNP in patients with AF with preserved LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined transthoracic echocardiography and NT-proBNP levels in the patients with AF and patients with sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken for serum NT-proBNP measurements within 24 hours of echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The group 1 was the patients with sinus rhythm (n = 30, mean age 68 ± 13 years) and the group 2 was the patients with AF (n = 33, mean age 70 ± 14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group 2 patients had significantly higher mitral E, E' (lateral annulus), E/E' (septal annulus), left atrial (LA) volume index, LA size, pulmonary vein diastolic velocity, and NT-proBNP level than those of group 1 patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve showed a NT-proBNP had good diagnostic power for E/E' (septal annulus) &gt; 15 in patients with AF at cutoff value of 433 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NT-proBNP level is well correlated with Doppler echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function in patients with AF and preserved LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP level more than 433 pg/mL may suggest elevated LV filling pressure in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
