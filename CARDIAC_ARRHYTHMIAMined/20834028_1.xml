<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 80 patients with first AF episode were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography (ECG), Holter ECG, and measurements of hsCRP, IL-6, and NTproBNP were performed immediately post conversion and at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrence was positively related to left atrial volume (P &lt; .001), with no difference in NTpro-BNP, hsCRP, and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased NTpro-BNP was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> at 1 month (P &lt; .001, F = 63.4) and was positively related to left atrial volume (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the lone AF subgroup, NTpro-BNP was lower and dropped significantly at 1 month (interaction F = 6.53, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial volume was related to AF recurrence, whereas hsCRP, IL-6, and NTpro-BNP were not reliable for AF relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relation of NTpro-BNP to left atrial volume could indicate a role in the atrial remodeling process </plain></SENT>
