<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAP) and/or ozone (O(3)) would increase dispersion of ventricular repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of air pollution are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> through mechanisms yet to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each of 25 volunteers (18 to 50 years of age) had four 2-h exposures to 150 μg/m(3) CAP; 120 parts per billion O(3); CAP + O(3); and filtered air (FA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure-induced changes (Δ = 5-min epochs at end-start) in spatial dispersion of repolarization were determined from continuous 12-lead electrocardiographic recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spatial dispersion of repolarization assessed by corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval increased significantly for CAP + O(3) (0.17 ± 0.03, p &lt; 0.0001) exposure only, remaining significant when factoring FA (CAP + O(3) - FA) as control (0.11 ± 0.04, p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The influence on repolarization was further verified by a significant increase in ΔQT dispersion (for CAP + O(3) compared with FA (5.7 ± 1.4, p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio of heart rate variability (a conventional representation of sympathetic-parasympathetic balances) was included as a covariate, the effect estimate was positive for both corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval (p = 0.002) and ΔQT dispersion (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the high-frequency component (parasympathetic heart rate modulation) was included as a covariate with corrected ΔT-wave peak to T-wave end interval, the effect estimate for high frequency was inverse (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAP + O(3) exposure alters dispersion of ventricular repolarization in part by increasing sympathetic and decreasing parasympathetic heart rate modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detection of changes in repolarization parameters, even in this small cohort of healthy individuals, suggests an underappreciated role for air pollutants in urban arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
