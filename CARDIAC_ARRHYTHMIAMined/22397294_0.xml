<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intrauterine arrest of the compaction of myocardial fibers is postulated to be the reason of LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this condition is extremely important due to its high mortality and morbidity that lead to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of LVNC among consecutive outpatients according to clinical and echocardiographyic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 3,854 consecutive patients examined at the Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Diseases</z:e> within a period January 2006 - January 2007 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent echocardiographic examination using the same equipment (Vivid 7, GE Medical System) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic parameters and clinical presentation in patients with echocardiographic criteria for LVNC were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyzing 3,854 consecutive outpatients, using two-dimensional Color Doppler echocardiography from January 2006 to January 2007, 12 patients met the criteria for LVNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of them were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 45 +/- 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyzing clinical manifestation of LVNC it was found that seven patients had signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with no embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the real prevalence of LVNC may be higher than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New studies have to be done to solve this problem </plain></SENT>
