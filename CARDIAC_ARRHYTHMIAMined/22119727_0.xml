<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heightened awareness has resulted in increased detection of the morphological features of NCVM in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multicentre study including paediatric patients affected by NCVM according to the echocardiographic criteria of Chin and Jenni </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included, 15 female and 14 male, the median age at diagnosis was 5 years and 7 months (birth to 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (55%) presented as an isolated lesion, 8 (27.5%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, one of them associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo>, 3 (10%) had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inborn error of metabolism</z:e>, 1 (3.5%) had Juvenile Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> and 1 (3.5%) has a syndrome being studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The location of the trabeculae has been predominantly at the apex, but also affected the left ventricle free wall in 11 patients (40%) and right ventricle in 2 (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No complications were present in 12 patients (41%), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in 12 patients (41%), an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 2 patients (7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 patient (3,5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 2 patients (7%), both of them less than 6 months of age (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow up was 12 months (2 months to 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current treatment includes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, ACEI's and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, and one patient is waiting for a cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms is associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical and prognostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is described </plain></SENT>
