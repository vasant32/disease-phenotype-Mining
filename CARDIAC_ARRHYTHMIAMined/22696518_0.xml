<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports evolutions of LVEF and treatments of patients implanted in our institution with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, after 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 84 patients with LVEF under 35% implanted between 2005 and 2007, 28 (33%) had improved their LVEF &gt;35% after the 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this period, even if Beta-blockers (98%) and renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) blockers (95%) were already initially prescribed, treatments were significantly optimized with improvement of maximal doses of beta-blockers and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> blockers at 2 year follow-up compared with initial prescription (62 vs. 37% and 68 vs. 45%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with improved LVEF, a trend toward a better treatment optimization and revascularization procedures (in the sub-group of ischaemic patients) were observed compared with non-improved LVEF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study of patients with prophylactic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, one-third of them have improved their LVEF after a 2 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite an optimal medical therapy at the time of implantation, we were able to further improve the maximal treatment doses after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the issue of what should be considered as 'optimal' therapy and the possibility of improvement of LVEF related to a real optimized treatment before implantation </plain></SENT>
