<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism underlying the low proarrhythmic potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in a model of pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was induced in 35 female rabbits by rapid ventricular pacing, resulting in a significant decrease of ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four rabbits were sham-operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 17 of 35 CHF-rabbits and 20 of 34 'sham'-rabbits, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/day) was fed for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight monophasic action potentials and a simultaneously recorded 12-lead electrocardiogram showed prolongation of QT-interval and action potential duration (APD(90)) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failing hearts (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> pre-treatment led to a prolongation of APD(90) (+19 ms) as compared with sham-controlled hearts but showed only a marginal effect on APD(90) in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion of sotalol (50-100 µM) led to a significant prolongation of APD(90) in sham and a further prolongation of APD(90) in failing hearts [+55 ms (50 µM); +70 ms (100 µM); P&lt; 0.01 as compared with sham hearts] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sotalol led to a triangular action potential configuration in sham and failing hearts, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> did not cause triangularization but caused a rapid phase-III repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> did not increase dispersion of repolarization either in sham or in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infusion of sotalol led to a significant increase in dispersion of repolarization in sham (+29 ms) and a further increase in failing hearts (+67 ms; P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> results in a rapid phase-III-repolarization and does not increase dispersion of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These electrophysiological findings are present in healthy hearts and are preserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This contributes to the low proarrhythmic potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
