<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complex, dynamic, and spatially varying substrates, however, pose a significant challenge for ablation, which delivers spatially fixed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe tissue excitation using concepts of surface topology which provides a framework for addressing this challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of mechanism-based ablation strategies in the setting of complex dynamic substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a computational model of propagation through electrically excitable tissue to test the effects of ablation on excitation patterns of progressively greater complexity, from fixed rotors to multi-wavelet re-entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that (i) focal ablation at a spiral-wave core does not result in termination; (ii) termination requires linear lesions from the tissue edge to the spiral-wave core; (iii) meandering spiral-waves terminate upon collision with a boundary (linear lesion or tissue edge); (iv) the probability of terminating multi-wavelet re-entry is proportional to the ratio of total boundary length to tissue area; (v) the efficacy of linear lesions varies directly with the regional density of spiral-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We establish a theoretical framework for re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that explains the requirements for their successful treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the inadequacy of focal ablation for spatially fixed spiral-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically guided principles for ablating multi-wavelet re-entry are provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The potential to capitalize upon regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of spiral-wave density for improved ablation efficacy is described </plain></SENT>
