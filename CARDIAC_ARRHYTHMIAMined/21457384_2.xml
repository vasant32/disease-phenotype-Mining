<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative modality for "real-time" left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony quantification and optimal resynchronization is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), coupled with vector velocity imaging (VVI), to evaluate LV dyssynchrony and to guide LV lead placement at the time of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and four consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients undergoing ICE-guided (Group 1, N = 50) or conventional (Group 2, N = 54) CRT implant were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For Group 1 patients, LV dyssynchrony and resynchronization were evaluated by VVI including visual algorithms and the maximum differences in time-to-peak (MD-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) radial strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings, the final LV lead site was determined and optimal resynchronization was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CRT responders were defined using standard criteria 6 months after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both groups underwent CRT implant with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, intraprocedural optimal resynchronization by VVI including visual algorithms and MD-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was a predictor discriminating CRT response with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of ICE/VVI increased number of and predicted CRT responders (82% in Group 1 vs 63% in Group 2; OR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.08-6.65, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICE can be safely performed during CRT implantation. "Real-time" VVI appears to be helpful in determining the final LV lead position and pacing mode that allow better intraprocedural resynchronization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VVI-optimized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> resynchronization predicts CRT response and this approach is associated with higher number of CRT responders </plain></SENT>
