<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 21 mutated individuals was assessed with clinical and instrumental investigations over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median observation period was 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac compromise was detected in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bradyarrhythmias</z:e> were the most frequent manifestations, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two individuals suffered from nonsustained and 1 from sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was detected in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the frequencies of the clinical expressions showed a high probability of suffering from analogue heart compromise in study subjects bearing the same LMNA gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement represents a very common phenotypic expression of LMNA gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects sharing common genetic background seem to suffer from analogue pattern of cardiac manifestation </plain></SENT>
