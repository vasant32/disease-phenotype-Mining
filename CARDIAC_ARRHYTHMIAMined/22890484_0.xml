<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study was a retrospective cohort of 378 adult patients (128 males and 250 females, 17 to 63 years) admitted with EPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 267 SVT patients (58.4 % (n = 156) atria-ventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT), 30 % (n = 80) atria-ventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT), 6.4 % (n = 17) atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT), and 5.2 % (n = 14) other) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MVP prevalence was compared in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MVP prevalence was found 27.7 % (n = 74) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses, there was a significant difference between AVRT and others about MVP prevalence (AVRT 52.7 % n = 39, AVNRT 33.8 % n = 25, AT 9.5 % n = 7, and others 4.1 % n = 3; p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, there was a significant difference between females and males (75.7 % (n = 56); 24.3 % (n = 18); p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between age and MVP just in female group (r = -0.116, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated in our study that AVRT and female sex may be related to MVP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was dedicated from these results that the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> should be focused on young female subjects with MVP more than the others </plain></SENT>
