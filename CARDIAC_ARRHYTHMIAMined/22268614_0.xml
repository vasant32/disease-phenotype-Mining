<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The problem of identifying idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>) patients who are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> is still unsolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> might predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and tachyarrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the suitability of blood pressure variability (BPV) compared to heart rate variability (HRV) for noninvasive risk stratification in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Continuous noninvasive blood pressure and high-resolution electrocardiogram were recorded from 91 IDC patients for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 28 months (range: [17-38] months), 14 patients died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or necessary resuscitation due to a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRV and BPV analyses were performed in time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the Mann-Whitney U test and Cox regression, we estimated the accuracy of clinical and nonclinical parameters in discriminating high-risk from low-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dynamics of blood pressure regulation was significantly changed in high-risk patients, indicating an increased BPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BPV indexes from nonlinear symbolic dynamics revealed significant univariate (sensitivity: 85.7%; specificity 77.9%; area under receiver-operator characteristics [ROC] curve: 87.8%) differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In an optimum multivariate set consisting of two clinical indexes (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, New York Heart Association) and one nonlinear index (symbolic dynamics), highly significant differences between low- and high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> groups were estimated (sensitivity of 92.9%, specificity of 86.5%, and area under ROC curve of 95.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diastolic BPV indexes, especially those from symbolic dynamics, appear to be useful for risk stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
