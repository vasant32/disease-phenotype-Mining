<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of catheter ablation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) recurrence and survival in a large number of patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> treated in the setting of a dedicated multiskilled unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Since January 2007, we have implemented a multidisciplinary model, aiming for a comprehensive management of VT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Programmed ventricular stimulation was used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were VT recurrence and the occurrence of cardiac and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 528 patients were treated by ablation (634 procedures; 1-4 procedures per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 482 tested with programmed ventricular stimulation after the last procedure, a class A result (noninducibility of any VT) was obtained in 371 patients (77%), class B (inducibility of nondocumented VT) in 12.4%, and class C (inducibility of index VT) in 10.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up time of 26 months, VT recurred in 164 (34.1%) of 472 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VT recurrence was documented in 28.6% of patients with a class A result versus 39.6% of patients with class B and 66.7% with class C result (log-rank P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiac mortality was lower in class A patients than in those with class B and class C (8.4% versus 18.5% versus 22%, respectively; log-rank P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of multivariate analysis, postprocedural inducibility of index VT was independently associated both with VT recurrence (hazard ratio, 4.030; P&lt;0.001) and with cardiac mortality (hazard ratio, 2.099; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Within a dedicated VT unit, catheter ablation prevents long-term VT recurrences, which may favorably affect survival in a large number of patients who have VT </plain></SENT>
