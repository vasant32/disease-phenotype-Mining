<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms underlying AF requires visualization of the cardiac electrical waves with high spatial and temporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While high-temporal resolution can be achieved by conventional electrical mapping traditionally used in human electrophysiological studies, the small number of intra-atrial electrodes that can be used simultaneously limits the spatial resolution and precludes any detailed tracking of the electrical waves during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The introduction of optical mapping in the early 90's enabled wide-field characterization of fibrillatory activity together with sub-millimeter spatial resolution in animal models(5,6) and led to the identification of rapidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001411'>spinning</z:mp> electrical wave patterns (rotors) as the sources of the fibrillatory activity that may occur in the ventricles or the atria.(7-9) Using combined time- and frequency-domain analyses of optical mapping it is possible to demonstrate discrete sites of high frequency periodic activity during AF, along with frequency gradients between left and right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region with fastest rotors activates at the highest frequency and drives the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>.(10,11) The waves emanating from such rotor interact with either functional or anatomic obstacles in their path, resulting in the phenomenon of fibrillatory conduction.(12) Mapping the endocardial surface of the posterior left atrium (<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>) allows the tracking of AF wave dynamics in the region with the highest rotor frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> is the region where intracavitary catheter-based ablative procedures are most successful terminating AF in patients,(13) which underscores the relevance of studying AF dynamics from the interior of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a sheep model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stretch-induced AF, which resembles some of the characteristics of human paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epicardial mapping on the left atrium is complemented with endocardial mapping of the <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> using a dual-channel rigid borescope c-mounted to a CCD camera, which represents the most direct approach to visualize the patterns of activation in the most relevant region for AF maintenance </plain></SENT>
