<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbations to this wave, referred to as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, can lead to lethal <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> if not treated within minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One manner in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> originate is an ill-fated interaction of the regular electrical signal controlling the heartbeat, the sinus wave, with an ectopic stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not fully understood how and when ectopic waves are generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on mathematical models, we show that ectopic beats can be characterized in terms of unstable eigenmodes of the resting state </plain></SENT>
