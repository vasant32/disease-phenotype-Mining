<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The hybrid technique combines a mono or bilateral epicardial approach with a percutaneous endocardial ablation in a single-step procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our early results with this technique employing a monopolar radiofrequency source through a right thoracoscopy in patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (LAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2009 and December 2010 nineteen consecutive patients (mean 60.8 Â± 8.6 years, 84.2% male) underwent right unilateral minimally invasive hybrid procedure for LAF at our Institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (52.6.6%) had long-standing persistent AF while four (21.1%) had persistent and five (26.3%) paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up according the Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were neither early nor late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was possible to complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the procedures as planned without any conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient died during the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At one year, 7/19 (36.8%) patients were in sinus rhythm with no episode of AF and off antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF peaked at 44.4% (41.3-47.4) at two weeks, was 30.4% (27.3-34.9) at three months, fell to 14.2% (11.6-18.1) by 6 months and was 13.3% (11.0-17.4) at 12 months Among patients with long-standing persistent (LSP) AF, 20% (2/10) were in Sinus rythm and off AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-year success rates were 50% (2/4) in persistent and 60% (3/5) in paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 12 months estimated prevalence of antyarrhythmic drugs and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> use were 26% (22.4-33.1) and 48% (37.2-53.2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One year results combining the percutaneous endocardial with the right thoracoscopic epicardial technique were, in our experience, not satisfactory, particularly in patients with LSP and persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings need to be confirmed by larger studies </plain></SENT>
