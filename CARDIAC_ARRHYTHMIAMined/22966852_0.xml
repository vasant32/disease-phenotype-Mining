<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differential impact of the LV lead electrical location in these patients remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-one consecutive CRT patients (mean age 71.7 ± 12.7 years, 55% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>] <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>) with an apical LV lead and LV lead electrical delay (LVLED) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anatomical LV lead location was determined via review of coronary venography and chest radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrical location was assessed through intraprocedural LVLED measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were dichotomized into either "long" LVLED (LVLED ≥ 50% of QRS) or "short" LVLED groups (LVLED &lt; 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the long LVLED group demonstrated significantly greater freedom from a primary composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization, and cardiac transplantation at 2 years (81% vs 30%, P = 0.007 vs short LVLED patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Longer LVLED was also associated with more favorable LV remodeling (LV end-systolic volume -41.9 ± 10.3 mL vs -4.3 ± 17.2 mL; P = 0.05), and greater improvement in LV ejection fraction (+9.4 ± 2.9% vs +2.3 ± 7.5%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even after multivariate adjustment, LVLED remained an independent predictor of the primary composite endpoint (HR 0.47, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrical lead localization, as estimated by LVLED ≥ 50%, is associated with improved long-term clinical outcome and measures of LV remodeling in patients with apical LV leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural LVLED assessment may provide incremental utility in targeting lead placement even in conventionally unfavorable anatomical segments </plain></SENT>
