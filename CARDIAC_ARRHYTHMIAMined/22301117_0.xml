<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prospective study included 1,357 type 2 diabetic patients from the Casale Monferrato Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, QTc intervals &gt;0.44 s and QTd intervals &gt;0.08 s were considered abnormally prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed 15 years after the baseline examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 862 subjects per 12,450 person-years died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the hazard ratio (HR) of cardiovascular mortality was significantly increased in subjects with prolonged QTd (1.26 [95% CI 1.02-1.55]) and was only slightly reduced after multiple adjustments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, prolonged QTc did not increase the HRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause or cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased QTd predicts cardiovascular mortality after a long-term follow-up period in a large, unselected population of type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
