<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between quality of life and perceived self-reported symptoms in an older, ambulatory, urban population living with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in older individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are well documented, the association between perceived <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> symptoms and quality of life is not well-defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional single-centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-centre, prospective study was conducted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients recruited from an urban outpatient cardiology clinic in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients completed a baseline quality of life survey with 42 of these completing the six-month follow-up survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was evaluated with the SF-36v2(™) and frequency of symptoms with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Severity Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects wore an auto triggered cardiac loop monitor (LifeStar AF Express(®) ) for two weeks to document <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data analysis utilised Spearman's rank correlation and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline and six-month quality of life measures did not correlate with recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, perceptions of diminished general health correlated significantly with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo>, lightheadedness/dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>/pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By multivariable logistic regression, more severe perceived episodes, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> and lightheadedness/dizziness were independently associated with diminished quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quality of life was significantly worse in patients with perceptions of severe arrhythmic episodes and in those with symptoms of dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings of this study indicate that symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients suffer from poor quality of life and that interventions are needed to improve quality of life and decrease symptom severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nurses who care for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients play an essential role in symptom evaluation and management and could significantly improve overall quality of life in these patients by carefully evaluating symptomatology and testing interventions and educational programmes aimed at improving quality of life </plain></SENT>
