<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two women with and 78 women without hot flashes were randomized to receive transdermal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> gel (1 g/day), oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> alone (2 mg/day), oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6716">medroxyprogesterone acetate</z:chebi> (MPA; 5 mg/day), or placebo for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV were assessed using 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings at baseline and after hormone therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, the cardiac variables were similar in women with and without hot flashes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In women with hot flashes, the mean 24-hour heart rate and nighttime heart rate showed a tendency toward reduction in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>-only users compared with those taking placebo and those taking <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> combined with MPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In women with hot flashes, oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> versus transdermal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> reduced nighttime HRV in the time domain (triangular index, -27 ± 36 vs +8 ± 36, P = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women without hot flashes, the use of oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> with MPA reduced time-domain HRV (SD of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals; -11 ± 13 ms, P = 0.048, and square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals; -6 ± 8 ms, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The women with hot flashes had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular ectopic beats</z:e> when using oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> with MPA than when using oral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> only (71 ± 128 vs 12 ± 11, P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>, especially when combined with MPA, may have adverse effects on HRV in women with and without hot flashes, whereas transdermal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> showed no such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, women with hot flashes receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> combined with MPA are possibly more prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> than are women using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> only </plain></SENT>
