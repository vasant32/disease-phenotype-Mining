<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels are located in heart cell membranes and hold a unique selectivity filter (SF) amino acid sequence (SVGFG) as compared to other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels (TVGYG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hERG provokes the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (ALQTS) when blocked, as a side effect of drugs, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its pore domain - including the SF - is believed to be a cardiotoxic drug target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study combining solution and solid-state NMR experiments we examine the structure and function of hERG's L(622)-K(638) segment which comprises the SF, as well as its role in the ALQTS using reported active drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first show that the SF segment is unstructured in solution with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ions in its surroundings, consistent with the expected flexibility required for the change between the different channel conductive states predicted by computational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that the SF segment has the potential to perturb the membrane, but that the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ions cancels this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SF moiety appears to be a possible target for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> in the ALQTS mechanism, but not as much for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3061">bepridil</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3561">cetirizine</z:chebi>, diphenhydramine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5138">fluvoxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The membrane affinity of the SF is also affected by the presence of drugs which also perturb model DMPC-based membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results thus suggest that the membrane could play a role in the ALQTS by promoting the access to transmembrane or intracellular targets on the hERG channel, or perturbing the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-protein synergy </plain></SENT>
