<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A community based cross-sectional study of 1214 Alaskan Inuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of FA concentrations from plasma and red blood cell membranes from those ≥35 years of age (n = 819) were compared to basal HR at the time of examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression with backward stepwise selection was employed to analyze the effect of the desaturase indexes on HR, after adjustment for relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Δ(5) desaturase index (Δ(5)-DI) measured in serum has recently been associated with a protective role for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This index measured here in plasma and red blood cells showed a negative correlation with HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15541">stearoyl-CoA</z:chebi>-desaturase (SCD) index, previously determined to be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality, on the other hand, was positively associated with HR, while the Δ(6) desaturase index (Δ(6)-DI) had no significant effect on HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endogenous FA desaturation is associated with HR and thereby, in the case of SCD, possibly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, which would at least partially explain the previously observed association between cardiovascular mortality and desaturase activity </plain></SENT>
