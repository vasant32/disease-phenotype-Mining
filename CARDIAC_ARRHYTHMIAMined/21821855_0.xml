<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) is increasingly prevalent, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) have demonstrated a survival benefit over medical therapy for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, but its benefit in patients with concomitant CKD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 199 subjects with CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in the Duke Electrophysiology Genetic and Genomic Studies (EPGEN) biorepository </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the cohort was 67.8 ± 9.3 years, and the mean eGFR was 41.1 ± 13.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> over a mean follow-up of 31.1 ± 18.8 months, corresponding to an annual mortality rate of 12.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was a 7% annual rate of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Cox regression analysis, older age, lower ejection fraction, and lower eGFR were found to be significant predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a gradient of risk associated with lower renal function: a 10 mL/min reduction in eGFR conferred a 48% increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy did not modify these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with CKD treated with a defibrillator, more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> is associated with reduced survival despite appropriate defibrillator therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be due to competing mortality risks in this population that attenuate the benefit of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in reducing arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age, ejection fraction, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> severity can be used to risk stratify patients before device implantation </plain></SENT>
