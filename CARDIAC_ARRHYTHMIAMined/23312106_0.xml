<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although it has been inferred that a biatrial maze procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in left-sided heart lesions may lead to better outcomes compared with a limited left atrial lesion set, it remains controversial whether the biatrial maze procedure is superior to the right atrial maze procedure in right-sided heart lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 56 adults who underwent surgical closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and various maze procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> between June 1998 and February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age at operation was 59 years (range, 34-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were paroxysmal in 8 patients, persistent in 15 patients, and long-standing persistent in 33 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A right atrial maze procedure was performed in 23 patients (group 1), and a biatrial maze procedure was performed in 33 patients (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence, development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> or other types of atrial tachyarrhythmia, or implantation of a permanent pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify risk factors for decreased time to treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 49 months (range, 5-149 months), there was no early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 1 late noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On Cox survival model, group 1 showed a significantly decreased time to treatment failure in comparison with group 2 (hazard ratio, 5.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-16.44; P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm without any episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence at 2 and 5 years postoperatively was 57% and 45% in group 1, respectively, and 82% and 69% in group 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left-sided ablation in addition to a right atrial maze procedure leads to better electrophysiologic outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
