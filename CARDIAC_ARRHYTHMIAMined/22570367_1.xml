<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) offer a powerful in vitro tool to investigate disease mechanisms and to perform patient-specific drug screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, electrophysiological analysis of iPSC-CMs has been limited to single-cell recordings or low-resolution microelectrode array mapping of small cardiomyocyte aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New methods of generating and optically mapping impulse propagation of large human iPSC-CM cardiac monolayers are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our first aim was to develop an imaging platform with versatility for multiparameter electrophysiological mapping of cardiac preparations, including human iPSC-CM monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our second aim was to create large electrically coupled human iPSC-CM monolayers for simultaneous action potential and calcium wave propagation measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A fluorescence imaging platform based on electronically controlled light-emitting diode illumination, a multiband emission filter, and single camera sensor was developed and utilized to monitor simultaneously action potential and intracellular calcium wave propagation in cardiac preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple, large-diameter (â‰¥1 cm), electrically coupled human cardiac monolayers were then generated that propagated action potentials and calcium waves at velocities similar to those commonly observed in rodent cardiac monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multiparametric imaging system presented here offers a scalable enabling technology to measure simultaneously action potential and intracellular calcium wave amplitude and dynamics of cardiac monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The advent of large-scale production of human iPSC-CMs makes it possible to now generate sufficient numbers of uniform cardiac monolayers that can be utilized for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms and offers advantages over commonly used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
