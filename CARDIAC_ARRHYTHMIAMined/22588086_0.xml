<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identification of risk factors is therefore important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in prediction of AF (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types) and lone AF in a large population-based cohort.Design: We carried out a prospective population-based cohort study.Methods: A total of 22,815 participants from a population survey in 1994-1995 were followed-up for a mean of 11.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age at baseline was 46 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>)-cholesterol, and information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment were obtained at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome measure was first-ever AF, documented on an electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for AF.Results: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>Palpitations</z:hpo> were associated with increased risk of AF in both women (HR 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.02) and men (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.54-2.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> the HR for AF was 1.98 (1.46-2.69) in women and 1.40 (1.13-1.74) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HR for 1 SD increase in body mass index (BMI) was 1.16 (1.06-1.27) in women and 1.47 (1.32-1.63) in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body height and BMI were associated with increased risk for lone AF in men.Conclusion: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>Palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and BMI were predictive of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in both sexes </plain></SENT>
