<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> may promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring (AECG) is a method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that 24-hour AECG in patients with HF who have a high risk of serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be less accurate than AECG extended to 48 hours and that, moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four recordings of 48-hour AECG in 84 patients with ischemic HF (mean ejection fraction 34 ± 7%) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Day 1, Day 2 were checked for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (est.AHI) was calculated using Holter, monitoring where est.AHI &gt;15 indicates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 48-hour AECG, VT occurred in 34 patients (40.5%) whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in 17 patients (20.2%), and patients with est.AHI &gt; 15 had higher VT occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two-sample one-sided test for proportions, 24-hour AECG from Day 1 showed a significantly lower percentage of patients with detected VT than 48-hour AECG-it was 23.8% (20 patients), meaning a significant underestimation with P = 0.0089 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assessed VT underestimation in the subgroups with regard to est.AHI, and found that it was present in Day 1 monitoring in the subgroups with est.AHI &gt; 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was absent in the subgroups with est.AHI ≤ 15 and also in Day 2 monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with systolic HF, 24-hour AECG may have insufficient sensitivity regarding serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> was detected in the first day, extending the monitoring may be recommended </plain></SENT>
