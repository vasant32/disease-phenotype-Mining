<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of pharmacological doses of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonists</z:chebi> often results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from the present study indicate that stimulation of cardiac adrenergic receptors elicits an extrusion of cellular Mg(2+) into the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect occurs in both perfused hearts and isolated cells within 5-6 min following either β- or α1- adrenergic receptor stimulation, and is prevented by specific adrenergic receptors <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential stimulation of the two classes of adrenergic receptor results in a larger mobilization of cellular Mg(2+) provided that the two <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are administered together or within 1-2 min from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A longer delay in administering the second stimulus results in the abolishment of Mg(2+) extrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, these data suggest that the stimulation of β- and α1-adrenergic receptors mobilizes Mg(2+) from two distinct cellular pools, and that Mg(2+) loss from either pool triggers a Mg(2+) redistribution within the cardiac myocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the sarcolemmal level, Mg(2+) extrusion occurs through a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Mg(2+) exchange mechanism phosphorylated by cAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, a patent anti-arrhythmic agent, blocks <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> transport in a non-specific manner and prevents Mg(2+) extrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> administration induces dynamic changes in total and compartmentalized Mg(2+) pools within the cardiac myocytes, and suggest that prevention of Mg(2+) extrusion and redistribution may be an integral component of the effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> and possibly other cardiac antiarrhythmic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of this possibility by future experimental and clinical studies might result in new patents of these compounds as Mg(2+) preserving agents </plain></SENT>
