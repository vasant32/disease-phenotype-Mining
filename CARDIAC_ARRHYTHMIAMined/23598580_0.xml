<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1261469" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ESRD">end-stage kidney disease</z:e> (ESKD) experience elevated cardiac stress because of the repetitive and intermittent character of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in ventricular electrical systole induced by necessary dialysis significantly contribute to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in ESKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The major objective of this study was to assess the behavior of ventricular repolarization in dialysis by analyzing QTc interval and QTc dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study sample consisted of 47 patients undergoing hemodialysis (61.7% males and 38.3% females), whose mean age was 66.79±13.16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them underwent three electrocardiograms performed before, during and after one dialysis session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular electrical systole was analyzed later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in maximum QTc interval and QTc dispersion associated with dialysis was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, an increase in the number of individuals meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After dialysis, higher means of the maximum QTc interval (473 ± 27.63 mseg) and of the QTc dispersion (58.95 ± 18.87 mseg) were observed in individuals with LVH as compared with those in individuals without LVH (455.21 ± 26.85 mseg and 44 ± 16.41 mseg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirmed an increase in the QTc interval and QTc dispersion associated with dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>That emphasizes the dependence of ventricular repolarization on fluid and electrolyte balance, and suggests a profile of higher vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with dialysis  </plain></SENT>
