<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> is proarrhythmic, and, as the use of therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (TH) increases, it is critically important to understand the electrophysiological effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on cardiac myocytes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-enhanced transmural dispersion of repolarization (DOR) is a mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated whether the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, the rate of temperature change, and cooling versus rewarming would alter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Optical action potentials were recorded from cells spanning the transmural wall of canine left ventricular wedge preparations at baseline (36°C), during cooling and during rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological parameters were examined while varying the depth of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On cooling to 26°C, DOR increased from 26±4 ms to 93±18 ms (P=0.021); conduction velocity decreased from 35±5 cm/s to 22±5 cm/s (P=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On rewarming to 36°C, DOR remained prolonged, whereas conduction velocity returned to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conduction block and reentry was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was seen more during rewarming (4/5) versus cooling (2/6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In TH (n=7), cooling to 32°C mildly increased DOR (31±6 to 50±9, P=0.012), with return to baseline on rewarming and was associated with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased rate of cooling did not further enhance DOR or arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> amplifies DOR and is a mechanism for arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DOR is directly dependent on the depth of cooling and rewarming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This provides insight into the clinical observation of a low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in TH and has implications for protocols for the clinical application of TH </plain></SENT>
