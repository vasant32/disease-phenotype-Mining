<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of total occlusions in the major coronary artery distributions on the IKG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Domestic crossbred pigs (n= 11, 20-30 kg) were implanted with dual-coil right ventricular defibrillators, and bipolar right atrial and left ventricular leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through the femoral approach, percutaneous balloon total occlusion of the major coronary arteries was performed in random order in the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each occlusion was maintained for 3-5 min with 30 min periods of reperfusion in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous 15-vector IKG and 12-lead surface electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded and analysed at baseline and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusions</z:e>, significant ST-segment disturbances are consistently seen on both surface ECG leads and IKG tracings compared with baseline recordings and are reproducible over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the multiple intracardiac recording vectors, each occluded vessel has a specific signature, allowing coronary localization from the IKG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> induces consistent IKG changes with injury patterns that allow the detection and localization of the culprit coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If duplicated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, these changes are likely to improve the time to diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes and thus favourably impact clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
