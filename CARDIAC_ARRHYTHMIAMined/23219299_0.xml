<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and causes of readmissions after implantation of axial flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Based on the REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive Heart Failure</z:hpo>) study experience, readmissions after LVAD implantation are thought to be frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed admissions to our facility in a cohort of 115 patients implanted between January 2008 and July 2011 with the HeartMate II axial flow LVAD, of whom 42 were bridged to transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To account for repeated events, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Andersen</z:e>-Gill models were used to determine possible predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were followed for 1.4 ± 0.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 224 readmissions in 83 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall readmission rate was 1.64 ± 1.97 per patient-year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The readmission rate for the first 6 months was 2.0 ± 2.3 and decreased to 1.2 ± 2.1 during subsequent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leading causes were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (66 readmissions in 34 patients), mostly gastrointestinal bleed (51 in 27 patients), cardiac (51 in 36 patients, most for HF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (32 in 25 patients) of which 6 were pump related, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20 in 15 patients) including 13 readmissions due to <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative variables associated with (fewer) readmissions in a multivariate model include residence within our hospital-extended referral zone of Minnesota and the neighboring states (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.91; p = 0.011), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 0.99; p = 0.027) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96 to 1.0 per 1,000-unit increase, p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>C-statistic for the model: 0.63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Readmission rates after axial flow LVAD implantation decrease during the first 6 months and then stabilize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The leading causes are <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, cardiac (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
