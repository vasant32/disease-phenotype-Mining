<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative contribution of Gαq protein-independent signalling in AT(1)R mediated transcriptional regulation remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We here present a comprehensive comparative analysis of Gαq protein-dependent and -independent regulation of AT(1)R mediated gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> to regulate 212 genes, whereas Gαq-independent signalling obtained with the biased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, SII <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> only regulated few genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SII <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> vastly potentiated β2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These novel findings indicate that the Gαq protein-independent signalling mainly modifies the transcriptional response governed by other signalling pathways, while direct induction of gene expression by the AT(1)R is dependent on classical Gαq protein activation </plain></SENT>
