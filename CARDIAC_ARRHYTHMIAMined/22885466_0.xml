<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the first use of a new platform, the Guiraudon Universal Cardiac Introducer (GUCI), in humans for accessing the left atrium for catheter-based ablations in patients with resistant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after total cavopulmonary derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The GUCI was originally designed for intracardiac access for closed, beating instrumental intracardiac surgery.The patient was a 29-year-old man with problematic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs because of severe uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and because his pacemaker was explanted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>.The GUCI was attached to the left atrial appendage via an anterior left thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GUCI was modified to accommodate introduction and manipulation of multiple catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This allowed electrophysiologists to perform catheter-based exploration and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker was implanted, with an atrial endocardial lead introduced via the GUCI cuff and a ventricular epicardial lead.Postoperative atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were controlled using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and atrial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 12-month follow-up, the patient was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>- and drug-free and returned to full employment.This new access offers an additional new alternative atrial access to treat resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after total cavopulmonary derivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current state-of-the-art makes patient selection difficult and uncomfortable for the surgeons because of incomplete preoperative electrophysiological data, such as a return to the beginning of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; however, more cumulative experience with intraoperative electrophysiological data and new mapping technologies should address these limitations </plain></SENT>
