<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have examined the effect of diurnal temperature changes on health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the diurnal temperature range (DTR) may affect the rate of hospital admissions for cardiovascular- and respiratory-related diseases, and therefore investigated the risk of hospital admissions of cardiovascular (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) and respiratory (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>) diseases attributable to DTR in four metropolitan areas in Korea during 2003-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The area-combined effects of DTR on some cardiovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> were significantly increased by an increment of DTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> were significant with the percentage change of hospital admissions per 1 Â°C increment of DTR at 3.0% (95% CI, 1.4-4.6) and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.1-2.0), respectively, among 9 diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For those 75 years and older, the DTR effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> admissions was greater than in those aged under 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis of a positive association between DTR and cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admission </plain></SENT>
