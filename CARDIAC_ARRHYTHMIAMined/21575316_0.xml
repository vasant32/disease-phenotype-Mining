<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various minor cardiac rhythm abnormalities have been reported in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have used only random electrocardiograms (ECG) to assess the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and the time when the ECGs were undertaken was not systematically defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and heart rate variability in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> during the convalescent stage using Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Overnight 18-24-hour Holter monitoring was performed in 35 children [mean (SD) age 11·7 (2·3) y] at least 24 hours after defervescence (on the last day of admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients, time- and frequency-domain short-term (5 minutes) heart rate variability (HRV) during the convalescent stage was also compared with the value obtained during the follow-up visit (at least 14 days after defervescence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the convalescent stage, cardiac rhythm abnormalities were found in ten patients (29%), including sinus pause (1), first-degree (2) and Mobitz type I second-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e>) (3) and atrial (4) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular ectopic beats</z:mp> (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the clinical severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> (DF, DHF without shock and DSS) and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the averaged RR interval, the time-domain HRV (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN 50) or frequency-domain HRV (LF, HF, LF/HF ratio) between the convalescent stage and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Various benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmias</z:e> and ectopic beats are detected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dengue</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> during the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
