<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although pulmonary vein isolation is very effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, it is still not possible to identify the arrhythmogenic substrate responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> in a large number of patients, principally those with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, anatomic areas in the atrium that are not involved in either the initiation or maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> may undergo ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until we have a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the different stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, it would be wise to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> early, before anatomic or electrical deterioration of the atrium occurs </plain></SENT>
