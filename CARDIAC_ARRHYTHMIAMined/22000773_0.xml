<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present trial was to investigate the benefits of preprocedural intracoronary administration of high-dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> during elective PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized trial of patients undergoing elective PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized (1:1) by sealed envelops to intracoronary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (120 μg for the right coronary artery and 180 μg for the left coronary artery) or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary study end point was a periprocedural increase in troponin I &gt;3 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary study end points were (1) the corrected Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> frame count; (2) troponin I release &gt;10 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; (3) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB mass release ≥3 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; and (4) the combined cumulative incidence of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and in-hospital urgent target vessel revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The safety end point was the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during study drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From November 2009 to September 2010, we randomized 260 patients who were undergoing elective PCI to intracoronary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (n = 130) or placebo (n = 130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A greater prevalence of calcified lesions was observed in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> group (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a greater prevalence of type C lesions (p = 0.091), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusions (p = 0.015), worse preprocedural Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> flow (p = 0.038), and more severely stenotic lesions (p = 0.005) were observed in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the primary (67.7% vs 70%, p = 0.69) or secondary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No serious side effects were observed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our randomized trial showed that preprocedural intracoronary administration of a single high-dose bolus of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> does not provide any benefit in terms of periprocedural myonecrosis in patients undergoing elective PCI </plain></SENT>
