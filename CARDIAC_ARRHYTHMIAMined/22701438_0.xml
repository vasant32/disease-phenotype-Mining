<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pitx2 is a homeobox transcription factor involved in left-right signaling during embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disruption of left-right signaling in mice within its core nodal/lefty cascade, results in impaired expression of the last effector of the left-right cascade, Pitx2, leading in many cases to absence or bilateral expression of Pitx2 in lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss of Pitx2 expression in LPM results in severe cardiac malformations, including right cardiac isomerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pitx2 is firstly expressed asymmetrically in the left but not right LPM, before the cardiac crescent forms, and subsequently, as the heart develops, becomes confined to the left side of the linear heart tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of Pitx2 is remodeled during cardiac looping, becoming localized to the ventral portion of the developing ventricular chambers, while maintaining a distinct left-sided atrial expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The importance of Pitx2 during cardiogenesis has been illustrated by the complex and robust <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> observed on systemic deletion of Pitx2 in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lack of Pitx2 expression leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> at mid-term, and Pitx2-deficient embryos display isomeric hearts with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_78'>incomplete closure</z:mpath> of the body wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, whereas the pivotal role of Pitx2 during cardiogenesis is well sustained, its putative role in the fetal and adult heart is largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them are genetic variants located on chromosome 4q25 adjacent to PITX2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since then several transgenic approaches have provided evidences of the role of the homeobox transcription factor PITX2 and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Here, we review new insights into the cellular and molecular links between PITX2 and AF </plain></SENT>
