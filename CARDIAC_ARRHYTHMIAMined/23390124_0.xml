<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The transition from persistent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is associated with increased complexity of fibrillatory conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the spatial distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> waves and structural alterations in the atrial free walls in a goat model of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: AF was maintained for 3 weeks (short term [ST], persistent AF) or 6 months (long term [LT], permanent AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>Fibrillation</z:mp> patterns were assessed with epicardial mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The origin of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> waves and sites of conduction abnormalities were more homogeneously distributed in LT than in ST goats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the total area fraction occupied by fibrous tissue and the degree of perimysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (separation between myocyte bundles) were not significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (distance between myocytes within bundles) was significantly larger in LT goats, particularly in the outer millimeter of the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, myocyte diameters were larger in LT goats throughout the atrial walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-resolution optical mapping showed that epicardial wavefront expansion was slower and more anisotropic in LT than in ST goats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, a mathematical model of a simplified atrial architecture confirmed the potential impact of epicardial endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> on AF complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Altered propagation after 6 months of AF is consistent with homogeneous structural remodeling in the outer millimeter of the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Loss of continuity of the epicardial layer because of endomysial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> may reduce its synchronizing effect, thereby increasing the complexity of fibrillatory conduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exact distribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> may be more important for the occurrence of conduction disturbances than the overall quantity </plain></SENT>
