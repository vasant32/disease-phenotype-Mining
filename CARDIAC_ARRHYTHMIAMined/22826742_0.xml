<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Report on this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the subregion is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We set out to determine the incidence of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and review the treatment and outcomes of treatment in our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective search of the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged 18 years and below admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) following repair or palliation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> over 5 years, from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A review of clinical notes, operative records, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> charts, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) records, nursing observation charts, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and out-patient follow-up records was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 510 children under 18 years were enlisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>7 cases of postoperative JET were recorded, (1.37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>184 (36.1%) of these were performed under CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> JET cases were from cases done under CPB, 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median age was 3 years and median weight 11.3 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient was febrile at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 patients had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> administration, 5 had <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> infusion, 2 patients had direct current shock (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>) whilst 3 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had control of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with conversion to sinus rhythm and no recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report a JET incidence of 1.37% among children undergoing CPB for repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="32599">magnesium sulphate</z:chebi> infusions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> alone or in combination in the management of JET on various substrates with good outcome </plain></SENT>
