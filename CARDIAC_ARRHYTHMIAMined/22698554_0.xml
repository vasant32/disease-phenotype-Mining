<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Conversion to an open thoracotomy during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy is reported to occur in up to 23% of cases and can be associated with increased morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a preoperative computed tomography calcification score based on anatomic location and extent of calcifications to evaluate the ability to predict video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing planned video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy between 2003 and 2009 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographics, comorbidities, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative chest computed tomography scans were examined by an attending thoracic surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcifications were scored from 0 (none) to 6 (major hilar calcifications at the resection bronchus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and the calcification score were analyzed for their ability to predict conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then compared outcomes among patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, converted video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and planned open thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 193 patients undergoing planned video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy, 148 (77%) had a completed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy, and 45 (23%) underwent conversion to thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The calcification score was found to independently predict video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who were converted to a thoracotomy had significantly higher 30-day mortality, more atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, increased blood loss, longer operative time, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>increased length</z:mp> of stay compared with those who underwent completed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy and longer length of stay compared with those undergoing planned open lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Calcification score based on the location and degree of calcifications can predict the increased likelihood of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This scoring system could be one element used to choose the approach for a lobectomy, especially during a surgeon's learning curve </plain></SENT>
