<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is associated with cardioembolic complications, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, resulting in severe functional deficit or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF patients are first stratified into low, intermediate, and high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> using the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depending on their risks, patients are treated with either therapeutic anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is the recommended therapy, it is underutilized clinically due to concern for narrow therapeutic window, drug-to-drug and drug-to-food interactions, and hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Newer <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents such as dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban (a direct factor Xa inhibitor) have already been approved by US Food and Drug Administration for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apixaban is the newest oral direct factor Xa inhibitor and it has been extensively studied in the AVERROES and ARISTOTLE trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apixaban demonstrated reduced incidence of primary outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events when compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apixaban is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylactic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there are several other indirect factor Xa inhibitors and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> under study presently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results from these studies will provide us with information about possible alternatives to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
