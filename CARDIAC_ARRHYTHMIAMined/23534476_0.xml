<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objective: Despite the broadened indications for Fontan procedure, there are patients who could not proceed to Fontan procedure because of the strict Fontan criteria during the early period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients suffer from post-Glenn complications such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> with exertion long after the Glenn procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the possibility of Fontan completion for those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Between 2004 and 2010, five consecutive patients aged between 13 and 31 years (median 21) underwent Fontan completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had been followed up for more than 10 years (10 to 13, median 11) after Glenn procedure as non-Fontan candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We summarise these patients retrospectively in terms of their pre-operative physiological condition, surgical strategy, and problems that these patients hold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Pre-operative catheterisation showed pulmonary vascular resistance ranging from 0.9 to 3.7 (median 2.2), pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 0.3 to 1.6 (median 0.9), and two patients had significant aortopulmonary collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracardiac total cavopulmonary connections were performed in three patients, lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection in one patient, and intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection in one patient, without a surgical fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitant surgeries were required including valve surgeries - atrioventricular valve plasty in three patients and tricuspid valve replacement in one patient; systemic outflow tract obstruction release - Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo> resection in one patient; and anti-arrhythmic therapies - maze procedure in two patients, cryoablation in two patients, and pacemaker implantation in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients are now in New York Heart Association category I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Patients often suffer from post-Glenn complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those, if they are re-examined carefully, some may have a chance to undergo Fontan completion and benefit from it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple lesions such as <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve regurgitation</z:mp>, systemic outflow obstruction, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> should be surgically repaired concomitantly </plain></SENT>
