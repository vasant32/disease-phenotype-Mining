<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a clear association between excessive <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> ( <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> ) consumption and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hyperpolarization-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi>-gated (HCN) current, I (f) , is known to contribute to spontaneous pacemaker activity of sinoatrial (SA) node cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induction are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The preparations of SA node were excised from rabbit heart, transmembrane potentials were recorded by standard glass microelectrode technique, and a whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record I (f) in enzymatically isolated rabbit SA node pacemaker cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human HCN2 (hHCN2) and HCN4 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using 2-electrode voltage clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Superfusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> increased the spontaneous firing frequency of SA node cells in a reversible fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ivabradine irreversibly depressed basal firing frequency and markedly attenuated the enhancement effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> on firing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> on I (f) were concentration-dependent in the range of 1 to 100 mM, with an average EC (50) value of 20.81 ± 6.71 mM and Hill coefficient of 1.19 ± 0.10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> reversibly enhanced the HCN currents in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC (50) value of 18.41 ± 2.75 mM for the HCN2 channel and 21.98 ± 3.54 mM for the HCN4 channel, which was accompanied by the acceleration of activation and deactivation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> , at both moderate and high doses, caused a shift in the voltage dependence of hHCN4 channel activation to more depolarizing potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, superfusion of high, not moderate, concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> caused a shift in the voltage dependence of hHCN2 channel activation to more hyperpolarizing potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the molecular interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi> and the hHCN channels, which may shed light on elucidating the potentially proarrhythmic mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>  </plain></SENT>
