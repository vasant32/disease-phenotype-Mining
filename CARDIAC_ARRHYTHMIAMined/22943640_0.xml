<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients underwent successful thrombolytic therapy within 6 hours after admission and conservative medical treatment were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QTc, Tp-ec, Tp-e/QT ratio were obtained and calculated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related electrocardiograph leads and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related leads before thrombolysis, (7±1) days and (30±3) days after thrombolysis respectively, and incidence of MAE up to 30 days after thrombolysis was analyzed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) QTc, Tp-ec, Tp-e/QT in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related leads in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> group before thrombolysis were significantly higher than those in control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05), and values from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related leads were significantly higher than those from non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related leads in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QTc, Tp-ec and Tp-e/QT <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly and continuously reduced from 7 days and at 30 days post thrombolysis compared the before thrombolysis (P&lt;0.05 vs. before thrombolysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Tp-ec≥100 ms and Tp-e/QT ratio≥0.25 before thrombolysis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-related leads were linked with higher incidence of MAE within 30 days post thrombolysis in this patient cohort [28.1% (9/32) vs. 40% (1/25), 27.8% (10/36) vs.0, respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
