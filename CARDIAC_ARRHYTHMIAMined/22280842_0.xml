<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the 1-week test-retest reliability of regional electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha asymmetry and power, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), heart period, and heart period variability measures at rest and during anticipation of an impromptu speech in 26 adults diagnosed with social <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder (SAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Across the 1-week time period, we found medium-to-large correlations for regional EEG asymmetry and large correlations for regional EEG alpha power, RSA, heart period, and heart period variability measures at rest and during speech anticipation, before and after accounting for age and medication status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to patterns observed in nonclinical samples and appear to provide the first documented evidence of test-retest reliability of psychophysiological measures that index central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity in socially anxious individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings also provide support for the notion that resting frontal EEG asymmetry and RSA constitute relatively stable individual differences in this clinical population </plain></SENT>
