<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study from 2000 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Urban university small animal teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: One hundred and one dogs diagnosed with GDV that had thoracic radiographs obtained preoperatively, and medical records available with the following information available: signalment, time of presentation, respiratory status, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, reason for thoracic radiographs, radiographic findings, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings on preoperative thoracic radiographs included small vena cava (40%), <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp> (39%), microcardia (34%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> (14%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> (5%), pulmonary nodule (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> (2%), sternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (1%), and pulmonary bullae (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four percent of dogs (85 out of 101) survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dogs without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> on presenting thoracic radiographs had a 10.2 greater odds of surviving to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common findings on preoperative thoracic radiographs include <z:mp ids='MP_0004548'>esophageal dilation</z:mp>, microcardia, and a small vena cava while the incidence of pulmonary nodules was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A negative association between survival and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> on preoperative thoracic radiographs in dogs with GDV supports the need to obtain these images for prognostic information in spite of the emergency surgical nature of the GDV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main limitations of this study include the possibilities of type I and type II errors, the retrospective nature of the study, and the lack of well-defined criteria for obtaining thoracic radiographs </plain></SENT>
