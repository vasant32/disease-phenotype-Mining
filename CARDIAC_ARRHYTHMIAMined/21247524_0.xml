<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the incidence, predisposing conditions, and course of AFL after lung transplantation in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundred sixty-nine consecutive patients who underwent lung transplantation were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a preoperative echocardiogram and postoperative electrocardiographic monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12-lead electrocardiograms were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Typical or atypical AFL was diagnosed by 2 independent reviewers based on accepted criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictors of AFL were investigated separately using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AFL occurred in 35 of 269 patients (13%) over a mean of 12 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who developed AFL had no previous atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 35 patients, 24 (68.6%) had atypical AFL by electrocardiographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>) were 2.9 times more likely to have AFL than those patients with lung transplant without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other independent risk factors for AFL were advanced age and preoperative left atrial enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 35 patients (8.6%) with AFL had persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and needed electrophysiologic study and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AFL is common soon after lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>, advanced age, or left atrial enlargement are at increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In most cases, AFL is a self-limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that resolves spontaneously with no need for ablation </plain></SENT>
