<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, medical therapy is the first choice for AIT patients, whereas the role of the thyroidectomy is unsettled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a total thyroidectomy on cardiac function and survival of AIT patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary university center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> AIT patients (n=24; nine patients with type 1 AIT, 15 patients with type 2 AIT) referred to the Department of Endocrinology and submitted to a total thyroidectomy at the Department of Surgery, both at the University of Pisa, during the years 1997-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The intervention was a total thyroidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: LV ejection fraction (EF) after the thyroidectomy and survival in December 2011 were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> enrolled patients had previously undergone to medical treatment for AIT, as appropriate, without achieving euthyroidism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate to severe LV systolic dysfunction (EF&lt;40%, group 1, n=9) or with mild systolic dysfunction (40%≤EF≤50%, group 2, n=5) were compared with patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function (EF&gt;50%, group 3, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two months after thyroidectomy, under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> replacement therapy, LVEF improved in patients with LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in those of group 1, in whom it increased from 28.2±7.2 to 38.3±6% (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, LVEF did not significantly change in group 3 (from 57.1±3.0 to 59.8±6.6%, P=0.242) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 67±42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred during and 2 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in one patient of group 1, 30 months after the thyroidectomy, due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No patient had relevant complications of thyroidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy, by rapidly restoring euthyroidism, may improve cardiac function and reduce the risk of mortality in AIT patients with severe LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
