<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current guidelines do not recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation in patients with a life expectancy of &lt;1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Better methods are needed for identifying patients at high risk for early mortality despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a risk prediction score to identify patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 1 year despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Detailed clinical data were collected on a large observational cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients from 3 tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-third of the patients were randomly selected to form the prediction group (PG) from which a risk score was developed using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This score was then applied to the remaining two-thirds of the cohort (validation group [VG]) to assess the risk score's predictive accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total cohort included 2717 ICD patients (mean age = 64.6 ± 14.5, male = 77.2%, primary prevention = 74.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A simple risk score incorporating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo>, age ≥ 70 years, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ≥ 2.0 mg/dL, and ejection fraction ≤20% (PACE) accurately predicted 1-year mortality in the VG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a risk score of ≥3 had a &gt;4-fold excess 1-year mortality compared with patients with a risk score of &lt;3 (16.5% vs 3.5%; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Risk reduction provided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in this cohort is not known given the lack of a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple risk score accurately predicts 1-year mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients, as patients with a PACE risk score of ≥3 are at high risk despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
