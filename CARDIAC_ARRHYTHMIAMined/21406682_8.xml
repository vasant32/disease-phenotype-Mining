<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A critical question is whether SERCA2a gene therapy predisposes to increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (SR Ca(2+)) leak, cellular triggered activity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the influence of SERCA2a gene therapy on ventricular arrhythmogenesis in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG telemetry studies revealed a significant antiarrhythmic effect of SERCA2a gene therapy with reduction of both spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SERCA2a gene therapy also reduced susceptibility to reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in ex vivo programmed electrical stimulation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and spontaneous SR Ca(2+) leak characteristics were measured in failing cardiomyocytes transfected in vivo with a novel AAV9.SERCA2a vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SR Ca(2+) leak was reduced after SERCA2a gene therapy, with reversal of the greater spark mass observed in the failing myocytes, despite normalization of SR Ca(2+) load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SERCA2a reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor phosphorylation, thereby resetting SR Ca(2+) leak threshold, leading to reduced triggered activity in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both indirect effects of reverse remodeling and direct SERCA2a effects appear to underlie the antiarrhythmic action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SERCA2a gene therapy stabilizes SR Ca(2+) load, reduces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor phosphorylation and decreases SR Ca(2+) leak, and reduces cellular triggered activity in vitro and spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in vivo in failing hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SERCA2a gene therapy did not therefore predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and may represent a novel antiarrhythmic strategy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
