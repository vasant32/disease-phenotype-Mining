<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sex-based differences in human susceptibility to cardiac ventricular tachyarrhythmias likely result from the emergent effects of multiple intersecting processes that fundamentally differ in male and female hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included are measured differences in the genes encoding key cardiac ion channels and effects of sex steroid hormones to acutely modify electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the genome-scale, human females have recently been shown to have lower expression of genes encoding key cardiac repolarizing <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents and connexin43, the primary ventricular gap-junction subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human males and females also have distinct sex steroid hormones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we developed mathematical models for male and female ventricular human heart cells by incorporating experimentally determined genomic differences and effects of sex steroid hormones into the O'Hara-Rudy model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These "male" and "female" model cells and tissues then were used to predict how various sex-based differences underlie <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genomic-based differences in ion channel expression were alone sufficient to determine longer female cardiac action potential durations (APD) in both epicardial and endocardial cells compared to males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent addition of sex steroid hormones exacerbated these differences, as <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> further shortened APDs, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> application resulted in disparate effects on APDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that incorporation of experimentally determined genomic differences from human hearts in conjunction with sex steroid hormones are consistent with clinically observed differences in QT interval, T-wave shape and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and critically, in the higher vulnerability of adult human females to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The model suggests that female susceptibility to alternans stems from longer female action potentials, while reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> derives largely from sex-based differences in conduction play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vulnerability </plain></SENT>
