<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty SD rats (weight 180-250 g) were randomly divided into control group (n = 10), stress group (n = 10) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> group (n = 10, 10 mg/kg i.p. for 3 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stress model (given by unpredicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild stress) was established according to Cronli's protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following parameters were observed:(1) ECG waveform change and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>;(2) tissue field action potential duration (FAPD) of thoracic spinal cord 1-5 and cardiac tissue mapped by microelectrode arrays (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) technique;(3) myocardial growth-associated protein (GAP-43), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (CHAT) distribution observed by immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscope (LSCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three weeks later: (1) The body weight, food intake, consumption of sugar water, the horizontal and vertical movement score, cleaning action of rats were significantly decreased, and fecal grains significantly increased, P-wave, P-R interval, QRS-wave and Q-T interval were significantly prolonged and heart rate was significantly reduced in stress group compared with control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beat</z:mp> was 80% in stress group and 0% in control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FAPD of thoracic spinal cord 1-5 nerves [(144.25 ± 12.63)ms vs (79.56 ± 8.01)ms] and of cardiac tissue [LA(122.43 ± 19.34)ms vs (92.59 ± 7.61)ms, RA(149.89 ± 14.68)ms vs (105.18 ± 15.94)ms, LV(162.62 ± 7.04)ms vs (110.45 ± 6.92)ms, RV(152.21 ± 30.49)ms vs (131.06 ± 12.04)ms] were significantly prolonged, FAPD dispersion (FAPDd) significantly increased [thoracic spinal cord 1-5(13.3 ± 9.11)ms vs (9.36 ± 7.01)ms] in stress group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disarrangement of myocardial cells, proliferation of collagen fiber, infiltration of neutrophil and lymphocytes in the cardiac tissue were also observed and distribution of GAP-43, TH and CHAT was significantly increased in stress group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these changes could be partly reversed by the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Metal stress induced cardiac autonomic nerve and myocardial electrophysiological remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in rats which could be significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> in this model </plain></SENT>
