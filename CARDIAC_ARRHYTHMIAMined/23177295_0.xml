<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of patients with post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (POVA) in a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: New-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> POVA after cardiac surgery (CS) is uncommon and has controversial prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 14,720 consecutive patients undergoing CS at Emory University between January 2004 and July 2010 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality were obtained from Social Security Administration <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression models were constructed to determine the risk factors for POVA and to estimate the independent impact of POVA on long-term survival after adjusting for 40 different covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: POVA occurred in 248 patients (1.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with POVA were older (63.5 vs. 61.6 years), had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (43.7 vs. 51.3), and had greater comorbidities (Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score of 7.2% vs. 3.1%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.018 per 1-year increase, p &lt; 0.001), emergent surgery (OR: 1.77, p = 0.019), and the presence of PVD (OR: 1.41, p = 0.049) were associated with a higher incidence of POVA, whereas higher left ventricular EF (OR: 0.97 per 1% increase, p &lt; 0.001), mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (OR: 0.37, p &lt; 0.001), and off-pump surgery (OR: O.41, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with a lower incidence of POVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>POVA was associated with substantially increased adjusted long-term mortality (hazard rate: 2.53, p &lt; 0.001) over 3.5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: POVA is associated with increased long-term mortality after CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Older age, PVD, lower EF, and emergent surgery are associated with a higher risk of POVA, whereas off-pump surgery seems to be protective </plain></SENT>
