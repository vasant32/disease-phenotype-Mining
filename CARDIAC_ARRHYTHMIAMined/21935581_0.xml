<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore the effects on atrial and ventricular function of restoring sinus rhythm (SR) after epicardial cryoablation and closure of the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients with permanent AF were randomized to mitral valve surgery combined with left atrial epicardial cryoablation and LAA closure (ABL group, n = 30) or to mitral valve surgery alone (control group, n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed before and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months, 73% of the patients in the ABL group and 46% of the controls were in SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in SR at 6 months had a reduction in their left ventricular diastolic diameter while the left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients remaining in AF, the left ventricular ejection fraction was lower than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The left atrial diastolic volume was reduced after surgery, more in patients with SR than AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients in SR, the peak velocity during the atrial contraction and the reservoir function were lower in the ABL group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients in SR, signs of atrial dysfunction were observed in the ABL but not the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atrial dysfunction may have existed before surgery, but the difference between the groups implies that the cryoablation procedure and/or closure of the LAA might have contributed </plain></SENT>
