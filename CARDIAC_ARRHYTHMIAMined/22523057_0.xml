<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Two-group matched cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted for CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> between 2004 and 2008 were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study subjects were matched to a cohort of uninfected CIED patients by age, sex and type of device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infected patients, the therapeutic approach consisted of complete hardware removal whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy, and implantation of a new device, if indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were systematically followed, with standardised outcomes assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality and predictors of long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 197 patients were included and matched 1:1 to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were present in 41.1% and definite or suspected infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> in 58.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total or subtotal hardware removal was achieved in 98.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow up was 25 months (12-70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in the study group and controls were 14.3% vs 11.0% (NS) at 1 year and 35.4% vs 27.0% (p=NS) at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of long-term mortality were older age (HR=1.09, p&lt;0.001), cardiac resynchronisation therapy (HR=3.70, p=0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HR=5.10, p=0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> (HR=2.66, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patients with reimplanted devices, epicardial right ventricular pacemakers were associated with higher mortality (HR=2.85, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> managed by recommended therapy, long-term mortality rates are similar to comparable controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors include patient and disease-related factors, in addition to implantation of right ventricular epicardial pacemakers </plain></SENT>
