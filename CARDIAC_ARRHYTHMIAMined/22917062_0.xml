<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infections</z:hpo> are the leading cause of childhood mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of physicians in rural areas of developing countries makes difficult their correct diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staff of rural health facilities (health-care technicians) may not be qualified to distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> by auscultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the goal of this project is the development of a tele-stethoscopy system that allows a physician to receive real-time cardio-respiratory sounds from a remote auscultation, as well as video images showing where the technician is placing the stethoscope on the patient's body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A real-time wireless stethoscopy system was designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial requirements were: 1) The system must send audio and video synchronously over IP networks, not requiring an Internet connection; 2) It must preserve the quality of cardiorespiratory sounds, allowing to adapt the binaural pieces and the chestpiece of standard stethoscopes, and; 3) Cardiorespiratory sounds should be recordable at both sides of the communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to verify the diagnostic capacity of the system, a clinical validation with eight specialists has been designed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a preliminary test, twelve patients have been auscultated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the physicians using the tele-stethoscopy system, versus a local auscultation using traditional stethoscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The system must allow listen the cardiac (systolic and diastolic murmurs, gallop sound, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>) and respiratory (rhonchi, rales and crepitations, wheeze, diminished and bronchial breath sounds, pleural friction rub) sounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The design, development and initial validation of the real-time wireless tele-stethoscopy system are described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The system was conceived from scratch as open-source, low-cost and designed in such a way that many universities and small local companies in developing countries may manufacture it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only free open-source software has been used in order to minimize manufacturing costs and look for alliances to support its improvement and adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The microcontroller firmware code, the computer software code and the PCB schematics are available for free download in a subversion repository hosted in SourceForge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that real-time tele-stethoscopy, together with a videoconference system that allows a remote specialist to oversee the auscultation, may be a very helpful tool in rural areas of developing countries </plain></SENT>
