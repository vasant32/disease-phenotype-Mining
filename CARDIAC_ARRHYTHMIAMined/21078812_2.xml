<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both phase 2 and phase 3 early afterdepolarizations (EADs) occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndromes</z:hpo>, but their respective roles in generating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in intact cardiac tissue are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Intracellular Ca (Ca(i)) and membrane voltage (V(m)) were optically mapped in a quasi 2-dimensional model of cryoablated Langendorff-perfused rabbit ventricles (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>E-4031 (an I(Kr) blocker) combined with reduced extracellular K ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o)) and Mg ([Mg(2+)](o)) prolonged action potential duration heterogeneously and induced phase 2 and phase 3 EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas phase 2 EADs were Ca(i)-dependent, phase 3 EADs were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The origins of 47 triggered activity episodes were attributed to phase 2 EADs in 12 episodes (26%) and phase 3 EADs in 35 episodes (74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When phase 2 EADs accompanied phase 3 EADs, they accentuated action potential duration <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, creating a large V(m) gradient across the boundary between long and short action potential duration regions from which triggered activity emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of phase 3 EADs correlated with the V(m) gradient (r=0.898, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computer simulation studies showed that coupling of cells with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> repolarization could extrinsically generate phase 3 EADs via electrotonic current flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, reduced I(K1) caused by low [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o) could generate intrinsic phase 3 EADs capable of inducing triggered activity at the boundary zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phase 3 EADs can be extrinsic as the result of electrotonic current across steep repolarization gradients or intrinsic as the result of low I(K1) and do not require spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduction of I(K1) by low [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o) strongly promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> mediated by phase 3 EADs in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> caused by I(Kr) blockade </plain></SENT>
