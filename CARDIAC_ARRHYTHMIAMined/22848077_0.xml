<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> underwent 17 radiation treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> [cumulative dose to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was between 16 Gray (Gy) and 70 Gy; <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> beams with maximum energies between 6 megaelectronvolt (MeV) and 18 MeV were employed] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During every session, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was programmed to a monitoring mode to prevent inappropriate therapy delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were interrogated to ensure proper function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calculated radiation dose at the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> site was &lt;1 Gy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 out of 17 radiation treatments (29%) the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> showed 6 malfunctions (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We noticed four disturbances in the memory data or device resets during radiation treatment and one case of inappropriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> detection due to external noise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case a late device data error was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> malfunctions occurred at 10 and 18 MeV beam energies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recommended precautions were taken to minimize the damage to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> during radiotherapy and the calculated dose to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> was &lt;1 Gy, in 29% of the treatments a malfunction occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We observed a possible correlation between the beam energy and the malfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This correlation may be due to an interaction between <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> produced in the head of the linear accelerator at beam energies â‰¥10 MeV, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27560,33609,51707">boron</z:chebi>-10 which is present in the integrated circuit </plain></SENT>
