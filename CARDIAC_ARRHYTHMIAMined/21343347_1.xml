<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on an inverse Gaussian density absorption model and using a population approach, the authors reanalyzed data showing an increase in oral digoxin AUC in healthy volunteers after coadministration of talinolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model fitted the data well, and the results revealed that the maximum rate of digoxin absorption increased nearly 2-fold, whereas bioavailability increased only by 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the increase in the rate of absorption seems to be a better indicator of intestinal P-gp inhibition than the increase in extent of absorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the authors use a simulation study to demonstrate the ability of the method to estimate bioavailability based on the population characteristics of digoxin disposition kinetics obtained from a different group of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
