<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : Several reports of awake off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (AOCAB) under high thoracic epidural anesthesia (<z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>) for single-vessel grafts have been published, but few have described its application in multiple bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the procedures and safety of AOCAB for multivessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Fifty-five multivessel AOCAB (52 men, 3 women; aged 68 ± 9.5 years) were performed at our hospital between 2003 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A medium sternotomy was made after <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During coronary artery anastomosis, a stabilizer and an apical suction device were used, and a coronary artery active perfusion system was used to maintain flow distal to the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> due to pleural opening, when occurred, was repaired using Neoveil sheet and drainage tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : There was no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operating time was 177 ± 35 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left internal thoracic artery was used in 55 anastomoses, right internal thoracic artery in 7, gastroepiploic artery in 17, radial artery in 48, and saphenous vein in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time of anastomosis was 4.93 ± 0.92 minutes for left anterior descending coronary artery, 4.75 ± 1.21 minutes for circumflex artery, and 4.98 ± 1.02 minutes for right coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> occurred in 17 cases; 14 were repaired and nonintubated AOCAB was accomplished, 1 was intubated, and 2 had temporary assisted ventilation and laryngeal mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time to discharge was 15.5 ± 8.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Multivessel AOCAB under <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> is not only feasible but also safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple grafts can be harvested under <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi>, and complete vascularization is possible under constant monitoring of blood pressure and consciousness </plain></SENT>
