<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although executive functions have been associated with autonomic regulatory capacity in healthy adults, there appear to be no reports of these relations in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether baseline autonomic regulation was associated with performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) in a group of 42 stable community outpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients exhibited faster resting heart rates and lower respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) than age-matched controls, consistent with previous research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients also completed relatively few WCST categories and made many perseverative errors, replicating prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the patient group, relatively better WCST performance was associated with slower resting heart rate and higher RSA, suggesting that inefficient executive and autonomic functioning in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> may be linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WCST performance and autonomic regulatory capacity were further reduced in a subset of patients receiving <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi>, but relations between WCST performance and autonomic regulatory parameters did not differ from those of other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings extend the neurovisceral integration model of autonomic regulation to adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and attest to the reliability of the model </plain></SENT>
