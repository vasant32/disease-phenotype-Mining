<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the assumption that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> leads to recurrent cardiac events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consideration of alternative perspectives and discussion of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It is not clear from studies like MIND-IT, ENRICHD or SADHART whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> treatment improves cardiac outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these studies, recurrent cardiac events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were recorded 6months or more after study entry, but shorter-term cardiac outcomes (e.g., stabilization of plaque prone to rupture and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or changes in areas of myocardium prone to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) were not assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the prevailing view is that shorter-term improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is necessary to improve cardiovascular outcomes, the possibility that shorter-term improvement in cardiac status might result in reduced symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has not been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If correct, this possibility might explain why studies have shown that patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> improves also exhibit improved cardiovascular outcomes and lower mortality, even though randomization to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> intervention in these studies had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is not clear whether improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> comes first and reduced cardiac events follows or whether patients whose cardiac status improves also exhibit improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Which is the chicken and which the egg is more than just a philosophical question, since it may affect the direction of future research in this field, and even how we approach the care of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
