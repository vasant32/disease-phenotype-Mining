<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is little data on the long-term efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in patients with symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the short- and long-term efficacy and tolerance of AAD therapy and RFCA in patients with idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, crossover, open-label study performed in 84 consecutive patients (mean age 47 ± 15 years; 60% women) with symptomatic idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> (mean <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/24 h, 13,768 ± 9,424; range 1,693-42,687) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated for 2-3 weeks with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, propafenone or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then patients were referred for RFCA, if they had drug intolerance, inefficacy or did not wish to have prolonged AAD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most efficacious agent was propafenone, followed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, and then <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> [35 (42%), 13 (15%) and eight (10%) responders, respectively, p &lt; 0.01 vs propafenone] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only responders to drug treatment had a significant reduction in symptom severity (Visual Analogue Scale score: 6.2 ± 1.4 vs 2.7 ± 2.0, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After AAD, 50 (60%) patients underwent RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up (48 ± 10 months), RFCA (mean 1.2 procedures/patient) was effective in 44/50 (88%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 remaining patients, 21 remained on effective AAD, 6 patients remained on ineffective AAD, and 7 patients were taken off AADs therapy due to spontaneous remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> or a decrease in symptom severity. conclusions: Short-term treatment with propafenone was more effective than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> in suppressing idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, optimal benefit was achieved with RFCA, which was effective and safe during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
