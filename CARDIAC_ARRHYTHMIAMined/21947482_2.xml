<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, cine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the LV was performed twice in 79 patients by using retrospectively PCG- and retrospectively ECG-gated cine SSFP sequences at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic volumes (ESV), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes (SV), ejection fraction (EF), muscle mass (MM), as well as regional wall motion were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with valvular defects and for patients with dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PCG-gated imaging was feasible in 75 (95%) patients, ECG-gating in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excellent correlations were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volumetric parameters (r &gt; 0.98 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables analysed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed for EDV (-0.24 ± 3.14 mL, P = 0.5133), ESV (-0.04 ± 2.36 mL, P = 0.8951), SV (-0.20 ± 3.41 mL, P = 0.6083), EF (-0.16 ± 1.98%, P = 0.4910), or MM (0.31 ± 4.2 g, P = 0.7067) for the entire study cohort, nor for either of the subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCG- and ECG-gated cine imaging revealed similar results for regional wall motion analyses (115 vs. 119 segments with wall motion abnormalities, P = 0.3652) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that PCG-gated cine imaging enables accurate assessment of global and regional LV function in the vast majority of patients in clinical routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS: Phonocardiogram-gating is an alternative to electrocardiographic-gating in cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phonocardiogram-gated imaging allows reliable assessment of global and regional left-ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Phonocardiogram-gating is feasible in patients with valvular lesions or cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because phonocardiogram-gating is insensitive to magneto-hydrodynamic effects, it is suitable for ultra-high field </plain></SENT>
