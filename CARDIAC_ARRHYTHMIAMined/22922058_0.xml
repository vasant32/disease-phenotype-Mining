<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current evidences have highlighted the progression of atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and electrophysiological remodeling in AF development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52288">Lysophosphatidic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi>), the simplest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, is associated with fibrotic disease and promotes proliferation of a wide variety of fibroblast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> stimulation in many cell types such as human endothelial cells, human renal fibroblasts, and myoblasts, significantly upregulates connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, which acts as a downstream signaling effector for transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) to drive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> could also evoke growth factor-like responses to atrial fibroblast, and subsequently induce atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> to trigger AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> is also verified to involve in numerous electrophysiological activities in non-myocardiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> is a possible cause of AF by initiating <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> response and altering electrophysiological properties in atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the hypothesis is confirmed, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> will act as a new target for AF treatment and administration of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> receptor blockers may be applied in the prophylaxis of AF </plain></SENT>
