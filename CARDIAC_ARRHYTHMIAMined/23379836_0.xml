<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify clinical, echocardiographic, and electrophysiological risk factors independently associated with persistence of AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients of the recently published AURUM 8 study with paroxysmal versus persistent AFL were compared with respect to clinical and echocardiographic baseline characteristics as well as procedural parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AURUM 8 study is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of gold versus <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="12" ids="49666">iridium</z:chebi> 8-mm-tip ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AFL was paroxysmal in 218 patients and persistent in 210 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that patients with persistent AFL had higher New York Heart Association class (P = 0.002), shorter time since 1st AFL episode (median 0.18 vs 0.34, P = 0.037), a higher prevalence of previous coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (17% vs 9%, P = 0.02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (17% vs 8%, P = 0.005), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> during AFL (P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (P = 0.002), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> (P = 0.049), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>Palpitations</z:hpo> during AFL were less frequent in patients with persistent AFL (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that age, weight, AFL diagnosis after initiation of class IC or III antiarrhythmic drugs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> during AFL and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> on echocardiography were significant independent variables associated with persistent AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> during AFL were independently associated with paroxysmal AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify clinical and echocardiographic risk factors associated with persistence of typical AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment of these risk factors can potentially not only prevent the transition from paroxysmal to persistent AFL, but maybe also the development or initiation of AFL in general </plain></SENT>
