<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several dozen distinct SCN5A mutations in BrS1 have been associated with the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the genotype-phenotype relationship remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study analyzed the SCN5A gene to elucidate the potential variability of clinical features in Japanese BrS1 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects of the present study included 30 probands (25 male subjects, 45 Â± 15 years of age) with Brugada-pattern ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had been resuscitated from cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another 10 patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (Sy group), and 13 more remain asymptomatic (Asy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified 8 different SCN5A mutations, including 6 novel mutations (CPA group: 1/7, Sy group: 3/10, Asy group: 4/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An A735E mutation (located at segment (S)1 in domain (D)2) was identified in the CPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A novel splice acceptor site mutation (c.393-1c&gt;t), which may produce a prematurely truncated protein, was identified in the Sy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An E1784K mutation (C-terminus) and a novel mutation V1951M (C-terminus) were also identified in the Sy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four novel missense mutations, A586T (D1-D2 linker), R689H (D1-D2 linker), S1553R (S1-S2 in D4), and Q1706H (S5-Pore in D4) were identified in the Asy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data may help us understand the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of BrS1, which is more prevalent in Japanese than in whites and other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
