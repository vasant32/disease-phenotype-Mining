<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In-person visits were scheduled once a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five Italian sites enrolled 1650 patients [27% pacemakers, 27% single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>), 22% dual-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, 24% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> with cardiac resynchronization therapy] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population resembled the expected characteristics of CIED patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a 20 ± 13 month follow-up, 2471 independently adjudicated events were collected in 838 patients (51%): 2033 (82%) were detected during HM sessions; 438 (18%) during in-person visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty were classified as false-positive, with generalized estimating equation-adjusted sensitivity and positive predictive value of 84.3% [confidence interval (CI), 82.5-86.0%] and 97.4% (CI, 96.5-98.2%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 95% of asymptomatic and 73% of actionable events were detected during HM sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median reaction time was 3 days [interquartile range (IQR), 1-14 days] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Generalized estimating equation-adjusted incremental utility, calculated according to four properties of major clinical interest, was in favour of the HM sessions: +0.56 (CI, 0.53-0.58%), P &lt; 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resource consumption: 3364 HM sessions performed (76% by nurses), median committed monthly manpower of 55.5 (IQR, 22.0-107.0) min × health personnel/100 patients.CONCLUSION: Home Monitoring was highly effective in detecting and managing clinical events in CIED patients in daily practice with remarkably low manpower and resource consumption </plain></SENT>
