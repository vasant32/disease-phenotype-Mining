<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The index case was an 8-year-old girl who died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and was diagnosed with HCM on autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her father had minimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> but had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator placed prophylactically with no appropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two brothers progressed from <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> to HCM on follow-up, the younger with significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and the older with mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They both had malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> courses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, which was terminated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, family members with same genotype can have significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
