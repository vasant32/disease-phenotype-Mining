<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> in adults is associated with elevated rates of serious cardiovascular events compared with rates in nonusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This was a cohort study of new users of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> based on administrative data from a five-state Medicaid database and a 14-state commercial insurance database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> users with at least 180 days of prior enrollment were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Users were matched on data source, state, sex, and age to as many as four comparison subjects who did not use <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi>, or atomoxetine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 43,999 new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> users were identified and matched to 175,955 nonusers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Events of primary interest were 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and 4) a composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000 person-years of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 2.17 (95% CI=1.63-2.83) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> users and 0.98 (95% CI=0.89-1.08) in nonusers, for an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.84 (95% CI=1.33-2.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dosage was inversely associated with risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and the composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> did not differ statistically from 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that this association may not be a causal one </plain></SENT>
