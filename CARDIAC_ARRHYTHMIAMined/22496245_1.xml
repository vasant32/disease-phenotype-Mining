<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the precise role of SLN in atrial Ca(2+) homeostasis, we developed a SLN knockout (sln-/-) mouse model and demonstrated that ablation of SLN enhances atrial SERCA pump activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is designed to determine the long-term effects of enhanced SERCA activity on atrial remodeling in the sln-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcium transient measurements show an increase in atrial SR Ca(2+) load and twitch Ca(2+) transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamping experiments demonstrate activation of the forward mode of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/calcium exchanger, increased L-type Ca(2+) channel activity, and prolongation of action potential duration at 90% repolarization in the atrial myocytes of sln-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous Ca(2+) waves, delayed afterdepolarization, and triggered activities are frequent in the atrial myocytes of sln-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, loss of SLN in atria is associated with increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and altered expression of genes encoding collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results also show that the sln-/- mice are susceptible to atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> upon aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
