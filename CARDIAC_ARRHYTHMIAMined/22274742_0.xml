<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, extremely short therapeutic time windows hinder its translational use and the mechanism of action remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because opening of the mitochondria K(ATP) channel is crucial for cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effect of DRIPost may be associated with K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of DRIPost were investigated using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to 90 minutes of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed remote ischemic postconditioning was performed with three cycles of bilateral femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>/reperfusion for 5 minutes at 3 or 6 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit scores and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were assessed, and cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was monitored by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that DRIPost applied at 6 hours after reperfusion exerted neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The K(ATP) opener, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi>, protected rat brains from ischemic injury, while the K(ATP) blocker, 5-hydroxydecanote, reversed the neuroprotective effects of DRIPost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that DRIPost reduces focal cerebral ischemic injury and that the neuroprotective effects of DRIPost may be achieved through opening of K(ATP) channels </plain></SENT>
