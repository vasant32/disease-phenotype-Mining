<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We analysed the type and mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> encountered in a series of symptomatic adults with atrial isomerism undergoing catheter ablation procedures.METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population included consecutive adults with atrial isomerism who had previously undergone surgical repair or palliation of the associated anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent electrophysiological study for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in our institution between 2010 and 2012 using magnetic navigation in conjunction with CARTO RMT and three-dimensional (3D) image integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (five females) with a median age of 33 years [interquartile range (IQR) 24-39] were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Access to the cardiac chambers of interest was obtained retrogradely via the aorta using remotely navigated magnetic catheters in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation successfully targeted twin atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in two patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in three, focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) mainly originating in the left-sided atrium in four patients, and macro-reentrant AT dependent on a right-sided inferior isthmus in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median fluoroscopy time was 3.0 min (IQR 2-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 10 months (IQR 6-21), five of the ablated patients are free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; two patients experienced episodes of self-terminated AF and AT, respectively, within one month post-ablation; the remaining patient had only non-sustained AT during the electrophysiological study and was managed medically.CONCLUSION: Various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> mechanisms are possible in adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0004133'>heterotaxy</z:mp> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potentially amenable to radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of remote magnetic navigation along with 3D mapping facilitated the procedures and resulted in a short radiation time </plain></SENT>
