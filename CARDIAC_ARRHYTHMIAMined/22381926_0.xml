<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one patients underwent orthotopic heart transplantation between the dates of September 1989 and December 2008 in our clinics were included to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was designed as retrospective analysis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data were collected from hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transplantation was performed by using standard biatrial method in 28 of the patients, by using bicaval anastomosis method in 33 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square, Fischer's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictors of temporary and permanent pacemaker insertion were analyzed using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the biatrial group, the temporary pacemaker requirement (p&lt;0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) (p&lt;0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>) (p&lt;0.05) were observed statistically significantly more than in bicaval anastomosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in the biatrial group, one patient needed implantation of permanent pacemaker and one patient-implantable cardioverter defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the postoperative echocardiographic evaluation, in the patients operated with the bicaval technique, the tricuspid (p&lt;0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral insufficiency</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.01) were observed significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the logistic regression analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR: 1.053, 95% CI: 1.019-1.176, p&lt;0.05), donor age (OR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.023-1.038, p&lt;0.05) and application of the operation with the biatrial technique (OR: 10.287, 95% CI: 1.298-91.278, p&lt;0.01) were determined as the risk factors requiring the temporary pacemaker usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the bicaval group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (ventricular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature beats</z:e>) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve insufficiency</z:mp> were observed less, the rhythm returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in an earlier period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Biatrial surgical technique, donor age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were determined as significant predictors of temporary pacemaker insertion in the orthotopic heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>Atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> frequency was significantly less in the bicaval group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In terms of factors affecting morbidity, the bicaval technical results were found superior than biatrial technique </plain></SENT>
