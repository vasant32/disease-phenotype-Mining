<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study describes the 5-year efficacy of catheter ablation for long-standing persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (LS-AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-term outcome data after catheter ablation for LS-AF are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Long-term follow-up of 56 months (range 49 to 67 months) was performed in 202 patients (age 61 Â± 9 years) who underwent the sequential ablation strategy for symptomatic LS-AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial ablation strategy was circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional ablation was performed only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PVI nonresponder, if direct current cardioversion failed after PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the first ablation procedure, sinus rhythm was documented in 41 of 202 (20.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multiple procedures, sinus rhythm was maintained in 91 of 202 (45.0%) patients, including 24 patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 105 patients, PVI was the sole ablative therapy, 49 (46.7%) of those patients remained in sinus rhythm during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a total AF duration of &lt;2 years had a significantly higher ablation success rate than patients whose AF duration was &gt;2 years (76.5% vs. 42.2%, respectively; p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Persistent AF duration (hazard ratio: 1.09 [95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.13]; p &lt; 0.001) independently predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PVI responders had a reduced risk of relapse (hazard ratio: 0.57 [95% confidence interval: 0.41 to 0.78]; p &lt; 0.001) after the first ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During 5-year follow-up, single- and multiple ablation procedure success was 20% and 45%, respectively, for patients with LS-AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients with a total AF duration of &lt;2 years, the outcomes were favorable </plain></SENT>
