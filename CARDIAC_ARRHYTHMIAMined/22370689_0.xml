<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> remain common post-LVAD implantation, such therapy may allow malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> to be tolerated hemodynamically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the clinical findings in a patient who had likely been in a ventricular tachyarrhythmia for several days and presented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, ambulatory, and mentating normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report, with previous similar reports, is additive to the body of evidence that LVADs alter the physiologic impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and highlights the need for thoughtful programming of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapies in these patients </plain></SENT>
