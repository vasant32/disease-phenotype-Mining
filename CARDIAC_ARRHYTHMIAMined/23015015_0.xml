<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the long-term reliability of atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction and the implications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) following catheter ablation of bundle branch reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (BBRT) and interfascicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourteen patients with recurrent monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) (n = 11) and incessant VT (n = 3) underwent catheter ablation of BBRT (n = 7), interfascicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 5) or both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without intraprocedural atrioventricular (AV) block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 2 months after ablation, three patients with BBRT and pre-existing prolonged QRS developed a delayed third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up of 2 years, two patients with interfascicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> developed a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) associated with worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent upgrading of implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy to CRT-D early after ablation which improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> during the 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the long-term follow-up of 39 Â± 13 months, VT storm recurred in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of the 14 patients died of deterioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and one had to undergo heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation for BBRT in patients with prolonged QRS is associated with a high risk of delayed third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation of interfascicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> can be associated with delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After ablation of bundle branch reentry, patients with prolonged QRS are candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy but the mortality remains high </plain></SENT>
