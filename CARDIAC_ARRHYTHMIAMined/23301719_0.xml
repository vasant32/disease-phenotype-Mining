<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">Venlafaxine</z:chebi> is a bicyclic antidepressant that may be associated with severe cardiotoxicity following large overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this short case series is to present different patterns of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi>-related cardiotoxicity and to discuss the potential mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE SERIES: Between January 2010 and July 2011, four patients were admitted to an ICU with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular failure</z:e> following large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> overdoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of the four female patients ranged from 35 to 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of them had no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> ingested by history ranged from 3150 to 13500 mg (extended-release preparation in two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The peak serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> concentration was between 2153.3 and 9950 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients died and one recovered rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initial ECG revealed only mild abnormalities in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients, at least one ECG recording demonstrated a widening of QRS interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients, echocardiography disclosed a left ejection fraction of 15%-18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented a severe <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> syndrome, with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were noted in two cases, including one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients were mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were refractory hypoxemia, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and cardiogenic shock, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Severe and diffuse left ventricular dysfunction may be observed after large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> overdoses and this is not always associated with severe cardiac conduction function abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> with preserved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac conduction are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation may be a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced myocardial damage in relationship with the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>) reuptake </plain></SENT>
