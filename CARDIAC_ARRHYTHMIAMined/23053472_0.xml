<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A description of the broad range of phenotypes resulting from these defects remains incomplete, and for this study, we sought to investigate the semiology at diagnosis in a country without a newborn screening program for FAODs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a retrospective French multicentre study, we analyzed 187 children aged &lt;6 years at diagnosis with FAOD confirmed by enzymatic and/or molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biological parameters at diagnosis were assessed to screen liver, heart, neurological, and muscle symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information concerning the long-term prognosis was also collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Predominant hepatic symptoms were observed in 89 % of patients regardless of the underlying defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> (92 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003348'>increased blood alanine</z:hpo> aminotransferase (ALAT) level (82 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> (88 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other frequent features included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Reye syndrome</z:e> (49 %), increased gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) (37 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> (27 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extrahepatic features were often associated in the foreground </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>Hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (75 %), neurological (64 %), muscle (61 %), or cardiac features (55 %) [as either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (47 %) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (31 %)] were frequently documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic events (41 %) were represented by shock (31 %) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (35 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001987'>Hyperammonemia</z:hpo> (73 %) and hyperlactacidemia (57 %) were the two main biochemical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total, very-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33184">long-chain acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (VLCADD), long-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20060">3-hydroxyacylCoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LCHADD), and medium-chain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acyl-CoA</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (MCADD) deficiency mortality rates were 48 %, 60 %, 63 %, and 20 % respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study presents clinical features of a large cohort of patients with FAODs in a country without neonatal screening for FAODs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results highlight liver as the main organ involved at diagnosis regardless of age at diagnosis, classical phenotype (i.e., cardiac, hepatic, or muscular), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> may be observed in various inherited metabolic defects, it is a reliable indicator of FAOD and should prompt systematic screening when the diagnosis is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The poor long-term prognoses reported are a strong argument for inclusion of FAODs in newborn screening programs </plain></SENT>
