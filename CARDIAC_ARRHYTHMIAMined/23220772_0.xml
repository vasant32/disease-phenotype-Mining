<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Catheters were placed according to the standard fashion for an electrophysiologic study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, namely, high right atrium, HB, coronary sinus, and right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ATs with their earliest activation recorded in the HB catheter and that were terminated by rapid injection of ATP (4.3 ± 2.5mg), formed the study group (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After catheter ablation of these ATs, the distances between the successful ablation site and the HB area were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one successful site was near the HB and the other sites were at the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva (n=6), tricuspid annulus (n=3), right atrial septum (n=1), and left atrial septum (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average distance between the HB catheter and successful site was 10.4 ± 8.8mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the 12 cases (the 3 tricuspid and 2 septal foci), the distances were greater than 10mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When ablating ATP-sensitive AT with the earliest activation recorded in the HB catheter, it is important to perform detailed mapping not only around the HB.  </plain></SENT>
