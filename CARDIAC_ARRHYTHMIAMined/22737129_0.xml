<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp studies in heterologous expression systems have provided important information to understand the genotype-phenotype relationships of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they could not clarify how SCN5A mutations can be responsible for such a large spectrum of diseases, for the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> or the progressiveness of some of these diseases and for the overlapping syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetically modified mice rapidly appeared as promising tools for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiac SCN5A-related arrhythmic syndromes and several mouse models have been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents the results obtained on these models that, for most of them, recapitulate the clinical phenotypes of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This includes two models knocked out for Nav1.5 β1 and β3 auxiliary subunits that are also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite their own limitations that we point out, the mouse models still appear as powerful tools to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of SCN5A-related diseases and offer the opportunity to investigate the secondary cellular consequences of SCN5A mutations such as the expression remodeling of other genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This points out the potential role of these genes in the overall human phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, they constitute useful tools for addressing the role of genetic and environmental modifiers on cardiac electrical activity </plain></SENT>
