<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regular physical activity increases vagal tone, and may protect against exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated training-related modulations of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in female and male endurance athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Runners of a 10-mile race were invited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 873 applicants, 68 female and 70 male athletes were randomly selected and stratified according to their average weekly training hours in a low (≤4 h) and high (&gt;4 h) volume training group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of heart rate variability was performed over 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectral components (high frequency <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi> and low frequency [LF] power in normalized units) were analyzed for hourly 5 min segments and averaged for day- and nighttime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen athletes (50 % female, mean age 42 ± 7 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant gender difference was observed for training volume and 10-mile race time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over the 24-h period, female athletes exhibited a higher HF and lower LF power for each hourly time-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female gender and endurance training hours were independent predictors of a higher HF and lower LF power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In female athletes, higher training hours were associated with a higher HF and lower LF power during nighttime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In male athletes, the same was true during daytime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, female and male athletes showed a different circadian pattern of the training-related increase in markers of vagal tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For a comparable amount of training volume, female athletes maintained their higher markers of vagal tone, possibly indicating a superior protection against exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
