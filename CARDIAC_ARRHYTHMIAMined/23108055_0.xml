<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ion channels and gap junctions in the cardiomyocyte monolayer may be modulated using drugs that suppress or enhance certain channels/junctions, or by genetic silencing or overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cardiomyocyte monolayer is particularly well suited for studies of functional electrophysiologic properties of mixtures of cardiac and noncardiac cells (eg, myofibroblasts), which otherwise would be difficult to investigate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping of monolayers has provided insight into mechanisms that can set the stage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, such as unidirectional conduction block, gap junction uncoupling, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, alternans, and anisotropy, and continues to enhance our understanding of basic electrophysiologic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
