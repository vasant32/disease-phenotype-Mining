<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the QT interval, a predictor for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, was related to depressive symptoms in ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an analysis of admission electrocardiograms from hospitalized patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> or non-ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> from two prospective observational studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was defined as BDI score ≥10, compared with &lt;5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with QRS duration ≥120 ms and/or who were prescribed antidepressants were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QT intervals were adjusted for heart rate by two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our analyses included 243 men (40.0% with BDI ≥10) and 139 women (62.0% with BDI ≥ 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among women, average QT corrected by Fridericia's method (QTcF) was 435.4 ± 26.6 ms in the depressed group, vs. 408.6 ± 24.3 ms in the non-depressed group (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, among men, average QTcF was not significantly different between the depressed and non-depressed groups (415.4 ± 23.6 vs. 412.0 ± 25.8 ms, P= 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, ACS type, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;0.40, and use of QT-prolonging medication, there was a statistically significant interaction between depressive symptoms and gender (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this ACS sample, prolongation of the QT interval was associated with depressive symptoms in women, but not in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the mechanism of the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and abnormal cardiac repolarization, particularly in women, is warranted to develop treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
