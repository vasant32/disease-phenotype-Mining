<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that high dominant frequency (DF) sites (AF nests during sinus rhythm [SR]) adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia are associated with the atrial substrate that maintains AF, and PVI incorporating the high-frequency AF nests may have a higher efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective and randomized comparison, 126 symptomatic paroxysmal AF patients that underwent PVI were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy of a modified PVI (ablation line: 1.0-1.5 cm from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostium with encircling the AF nests [spectral analysis with DF &gt;70 Hz during SR, Group II]) versus the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>-guided conventional PVI (Group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group II, the DF value along the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostium was lower than 70 Hz after the PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the freedom from symptomatic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also followed the autonomic function by a time-domain analysis of the heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, AF nests were observed and electric isolation was successfully obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a mean duration of 16 Â± 6.1 months of follow-up, Group II had a higher single procedure efficacy without drugs (78.7% vs 66.1%, log-rank test: P = 0.02), and fewer repeat procedures (6.6% vs 23%; P = 0.04), as compared to Group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PVI incorporating the high frequency AF nests adjacent to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia had a better single procedure efficacy </plain></SENT>
