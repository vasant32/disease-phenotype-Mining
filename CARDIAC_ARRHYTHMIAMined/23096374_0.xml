<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although conventional transvenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is currently widely used, it is associated with severe intra- and perioperative complications related to the use of transvenous leads, mostly occurring late after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent introduction of a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> system with fully subcutaneous sensing and shocking capabilities has provided a valuable therapeutic option for special patient groups, allowing to identify and stop malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> while discriminating them from high-rate <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This has also given us the opportunity to analyze the advantages and limitations of both implantable lifesaving electrical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, the technical characteristics of subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are described along with the recent advances in clinical and experimental research that have led to the introduction of these devices into clinical practice (over 1000 patients have been treated worldwide since 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are indicated for both primary and secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in patients at risk for acquired or congenital arrhythmogenic diseases, including those with an underlying genetic molecular mechanism, provided that they do not require antibradycardia or antitachycardia pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy, which represent the main limitations of these new devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> system has the advantage of avoiding the need for transvenous leads, making its implantation or removal much simpler without requiring fluoroscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> can be used in children, young subjects and athletes, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for whom venous access may be difficult to achieve </plain></SENT>
