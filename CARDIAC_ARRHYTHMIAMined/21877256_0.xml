<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intrapericardial (IP) delivery of anti-arrhythmic agents proposes to achieve higher myocardial levels while minimizing plasma concentrations, thus diminishing systemic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IP delivery enables concentrations at the target site to be more precisely controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study objective was to compare the relative cardiac effects of intrapericardial administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> to standard intravenous (IV) delivery in a swine surgical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to answer the question of how IP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, atrial electrophysiology, and pharmacokinetics compared with IV delivery, a medial sternotomy was performed on 21 swine that were divided into three groups: (1) After inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> boluses were delivered IP (n = 4) or IV (n = 4); (2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> was administered either IP (n = 3) or IV (n = 3) with saline controls (n = 3), and electrophysiologic data were collected; (3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> levels were tracked both in the blood (IV, n = 2) and pericardial (IP, n = 2) fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After either IP or IV delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, heart rates were lowered significantly to 70% and 73% of control rate, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of IV-administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> was considerably reduced after 1 h but was sustained longer in the IP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ventricular contractility and mean arterial pressure parameters were significantly lower in IV-treated animals but were nearly unaffected in IP-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With IP administration, the elimination half-life of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> in pericardial fluid was 14.4 min with negligible accumulations in the plasma, whereas with IV delivery, the elimination half-life in plasma was 11.1 min with negligible amounts found in the pericardial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The targeted intrapericardial delivery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> effectively lowers heart rates for sustained periods of time, with minimal effect on either ventricular contractility or mean arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not observe dramatic changes in induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> times or refractory periods using this model </plain></SENT>
