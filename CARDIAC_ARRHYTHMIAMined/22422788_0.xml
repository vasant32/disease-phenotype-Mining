<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Left-sided ventricular arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is rare and represents a rather different expression of the arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo>, ARVC plays a significant role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ARVC is considered as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology that primarily involves the right ventricle (RV) and is characterized by progressive replacement of myocytes by fibro-fatty tissue, complicating a spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predominant ARVC with left ventricular (LV) involvement is also reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LV variant of arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with minimal or no RV involvement is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 31-year-old previously healthy young man, without a significant family history, was found dead in bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed an <z:mp ids='MP_0000274'>enlarged heart</z:mp> and asymmetrical LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> with widely patent coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LV myocardium demonstrated evidence of prominent epicardial fibro-fatty tissue that is predominantly fatty in nature and infiltrates into the myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microscopy of the LV free wall showed fibro-fatty tissue infiltration into the epicardial aspect of the LV that extends well into the mid-myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A moderate to marked degree of interstitial fibrous tissue deposition was noted about adipocytes and cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischaemic changes or of significant myofibre disarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The RV showed minimal fibro-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_591'>fatty infiltration</z:mpath> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This report highlights a rare case which confirms previous observations that the LV variant of arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> could occur with minimal or no involvement of the RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required in this context to elicit the spectrum and the exact nature of this disease </plain></SENT>
