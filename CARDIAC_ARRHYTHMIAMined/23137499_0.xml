<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevation of cardiac biomarkers during cell delivery has been frequently described, but the clinical implications have never been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ACT34-CMI was a randomized double-blind study assessing the use of intramyocardial delivery of autologous CD34(+) cells for the treatment of refractory <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients (n = 167) underwent G-CSF-mediated (5 μg/[kg day] × 5 days) stem cell mobilization, apheresis, and intramyocardial injection of 1 × 10(5)/kg or 5 × 10(5)/kg CD34(+) cells or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Troponin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> kinase MB were assessed at baseline (n = 161), after cell mobilization and apheresis (n = 153 and 143, respectively), and post-intramyocardial injection (n = 155 and 141, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, urgent revascularization, or sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (4.3%) subjects had troponin above the upper limits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (ULN) at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four (22.2%) and 11 (7.2%) subjects had troponin levels &gt; ULN or &gt;3× ULN after cell mobilization and apheresis, whereas 72 (46.1%) and 39 (25.2%) subjects had troponin elevations &gt; ULN or &gt;3× ULN, respectively, after intramyocardial injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age, but no other preprocedural factors, was predictive of troponin elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural troponin elevation was not associated with an increased risk of MACE during 1 year, especially in cell therapy-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Troponin elevation is common during stem cell harvesting and intramyocardial administration, is usually asymptomatic, and does not appear to be associated with long-term MACE in subjects undergoing stem cell mobilization and intramyocardial injection </plain></SENT>
