<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, represents a major health burden to individuals and health care system within the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lifetime risk for the development of AF at age 40 years has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is associated with substantial morbidity and a 2-fold increased risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given its increasing prevalence with age, coupled with the aging population, the number of Americans affected with AF is expected to increase from approximately 2.3 million in the year 2000 to nearly 16 million by 2050 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This AF epidemic is further complicated by the lack of highly effective therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One reason for the lack of effective therapies for AF stems from incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has often been regarded as a condition that occurs in the context of atrial electrical and structural remodeling that can result from cardiac and systemic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, up to 30% of patients have no obvious cause and are said to have idiopathic or "lone" AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up until recently, AF was considered to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, nongenetic disorder, but we and others have shown that lone AF has a substantial genetic basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels (KCNQ1, KCNE1-5, KCNJ2, KCNA5, and SCN5A), gap junctions (GJA5), and signaling molecules (atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, nucleoporins [NUP155]) have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> and small kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The advent of the human genome and HapMap projects and high-throughput genotyping has fundamentally accelerated our ability to discover the genetic contribution to common variation in human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 2007, a genome-wide association study identified 2 genetic variants that associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More recently, 2 additional AF loci on chromosomes 16q22 and 1q21 have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is quite likely, however, that the effects of alleles in many genes contribute to common complex diseases such as AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall AF risk associated with common variants identified by the genome-wide association study approach is small (odds ratios, 1.1-2.5) and explains less than 10% of the heritability in lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that rare independent variants with large effects strong effects may account for a large fraction of the risk for lone AF </plain></SENT>
