<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inward-rectifier K+ current (IK1) is believed to be an important regulator of reentrant-spiral dynamics and a major component of AF-related electrical remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-26 (miR-26) is predicted to target the gene encoding KIR2.1, KCNJ2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that miR-26 was downregulated in atrial samples from AF animals and patients and this downregulation was accompanied by upregulation of IK1/KIR2.1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>miR-26 overexpression suppressed expression of KCNJ2/KIR2.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, miR-26 knockdown, inhibition, or binding-site mutation enhanced KCNJ2/KIR2.1 expression, establishing KCNJ2 as a miR-26 target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of endogenous miR-26 promoted AF in mice, whereas adenovirus-mediated expression of miR-26 reduced AF vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kcnj2-specific miR-masks eliminated miR-26-mediated reductions in Kcnj2, abolishing miR-26's protective effects, while coinjection of a Kcnj2-specific miR-mimic prevented miR-26 knockdown-associated AF in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a known actor in AF-associated remodeling, was found to negatively regulate miR-26 transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that miR-26 controls the expression of KCNJ2 and suggest that this downregulation may promote AF </plain></SENT>
