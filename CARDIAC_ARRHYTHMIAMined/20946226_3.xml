<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that increased intrathoracic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_106'>fluid accumulation</z:mpath> in patients with HF, as measured by an index of intrathoracic impedance, is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed interrogations in a cohort of 96 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤ 35%) with devices that monitor intrathoracic impedance (OptiVol fluid index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) were adjudicated and stratified according to predetermined fluid index thresholds (OptiVol indices of 15, 30, 45, 60 Ω-days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes occurred in 16 patients (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was more common on days when the fluid index was elevated using threshold values of 15, 30, and 45 Ω-days (P = 0.006, 0.04, 0.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the percent of time above any threshold between patients with and without VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HF who develop VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, volume overload, as detected by an index incorporating changes in intrathoracic impedance, was temporally associated with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
