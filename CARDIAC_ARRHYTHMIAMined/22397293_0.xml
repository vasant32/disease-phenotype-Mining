<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to establish whether there is any correlation between the level of expected operative risk and postoperative nonlethal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 853 patients subjected to the open heart surgery were investigated, 622 (73%) males and 231 (27%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 57.2 +/- 9.9 (16-81) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the additive EuroSCORE model: groups I, II and III with the expected operative risk of 0%-2%, 2%-5% and over 5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical methods of correlation and t-test were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high degree of correlation between the operative risk level and frequency of postoperative nonlethal complications (R = 0.98) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average rate of complications was 24% for the whole group of 853 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It accounted for 21%, 29% and 47% in the groups I, II and III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to the expected operative risk level there was a statistically significant difference in respect of heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (p = 0.02), neurologic complications (p = 0.002), and pulmonary complications (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show a high degree of correlation between the expected level of operative risk according to the EuroSCORE model and the frequency of postoperative nonlethal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is a statistically significant difference in respect to frequency of heart rhythm disturbances, pulmonary and neurological complications and expected operative mortality </plain></SENT>
