<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the anti-arrhythmic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29368">sulfamide</z:chebi> analogues of changrolin and to characterize the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> of compound 6f (sulcardine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, Sul) as a novel anti-arrhythmic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The anti-arrhythmic effects of compounds were studied against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rats and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of Sul on transmembrane action potentials were investigated in isolated rabbit sinoatrial nodes and guinea-pig papillary muscles using intracellular recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a whole-cell recording technique, the effects of Sul on <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, calcium current, and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents were examined in isolated single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of rats, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29368">sulfamide</z:chebi> analogues of changrolin (4, 5, and 6a-6p) exhibited various anti-arrhythmic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> of compound 6f (Sul) increased the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> required to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in each treated animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ED₅₀ value of Sul in rats was 196 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of guinea pigs, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses of Sul increased the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> required to induce VP, VT, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In papillary preparations, Sul produced a concentration-dependent decrease in <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and V(max), prolonged APD(90) and ERP, whereas RP was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneously beating sinus nodes, Sul reduced <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> and V(max) in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The whole-cell recording studies revealed that Sul produced a reversible reduction in I(Na) (IC₅₀=26.9 μmol/L) and I(Ca,L)(IC₅₀=69.2 μmol/L), whereas the inward rectifier (I(K1)) and the delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents (I(K)) were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As a multi-ion channel blocker, Sul may have potent efficacy in anti-atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
