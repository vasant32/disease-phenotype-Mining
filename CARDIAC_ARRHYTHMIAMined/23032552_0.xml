<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients experience delayed muscle relaxation causing functionally limiting stiffness and pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine-induced <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blockade reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonia</z:hpo> in small studies; however, as is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e>, larger studies of safety and efficacy have not previously been considered feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of mexiletine for symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonia</z:hpo> in patients with NDMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-period crossover study at 7 neuromuscular referral centers in 4 countries of 59 patients with NDMs conducted between December 23, 2008, and March 30, 2011, as part of the National Institutes of Health-funded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rare Disease</z:e> Clinical Research Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Oral 200-mg mexiletine or placebo capsules 3 times daily for 4 weeks, followed by the opposite intervention for 4 weeks, with 1-week washout in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-reported severity score of stiffness recorded on an interactive voice response (IVR) diary (scale of 1 = minimal to 9 = worst ever experienced) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included IVR-reported changes in pain, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and tiredness; clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonia</z:hpo> assessment; quantitative measure of handgrip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonia</z:hpo>; and Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life summary quality of life score (INQOL-QOL, percentage of maximal detrimental impact) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mexiletine significantly improved patient-reported severity score stiffness on the IVR diary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of a statistically significant interaction between treatment and period for this outcome, primary end point is presented by period (period 1 means were 2.53 for mexiletine and 4.21 for placebo; difference, -1.68; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.706; P &lt; .001; period 2 means were 1.60 for mexiletine and 5.27 for placebo; difference, -3.68; 95% CI, -3.85 to -0.139; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine improved the INQOL-QOL score (mexiletine, 14.0 vs placebo, 16.7; difference, -2.69; 95% CI, -4.07 to -1.30; P &lt; .001) and decreased handgrip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonia</z:hpo> on clinical examination (mexiletine, 0.164 seconds vs placebo, 0.494 seconds; difference, -0.330; 95% CI, -0.633 to -0.142; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse effect was gastrointestinal (9 mexiletine and 1 placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two participants experienced transient cardiac effects that did not require stopping the study (1 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One serious adverse event was determined to be not study related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study of patients with NDMs, the use of mexiletine compared with placebo resulted in improved patient-reported stiffness over 4 weeks of treatment, despite some concern about the maintenance of blinding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00832000 </plain></SENT>
