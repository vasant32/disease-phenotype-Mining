<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Physical examination, echocardiography, telemetric electrocardiography and postmortem were used to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were grouped as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e>, structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected at admission for cTnI analysis and the results were compared with those for 18 healthy horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 49 horses were admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated cTnI concentration (&gt;0.03 ng/mL) was observed in a greater proportion of horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> (7/7), compared with healthy horses (0/18; P &lt; 0.0001), horses with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (7/25; P = 0.001), and horses with a lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (2/17; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median cTnI concentration for horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> was 17.5 ng/mL (range 0.78-49.87 ng/mL), which was higher than in the healthy horses (0.01 ng/mL, range 0.01-0.03 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 49 horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, the median cTnI concentration for non-survivors (0.28 ng/mL, range 0.01-49.87 ng/mL) was higher than for survivors (0.01 ng/mL, range 0.01-30.31 ng/mL; P = 0.0035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the proportion of surviving horses with an elevated cTnI (10/39, 26%) was not significantly different from the proportion of non-surviving horses with an elevated cTnI (6/10, 60%; P = 0.060) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: cTnI is elevated in horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> and elevated to a lesser degree in some horses with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The association between cTnI concentration and survival was not clear </plain></SENT>
