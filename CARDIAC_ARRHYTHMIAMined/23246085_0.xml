<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we analyze the influence of QRS detection errors on HRV results based on signal entropy measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we study the influence that QRS detection errors have on the discrimination power of ApEn and SampEn using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Suppression Trial (CAST) database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experiments assessed the discrimination capability of ApEn and SampEn under different levels of QRS detection errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that these measures are sensitive to the presence of ectopic peaks: from a successful classification rate of 100%, down to a 75% when spikes are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The discriminating capability of the metrics degraded as the number of misdetections increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For an error rate of 2% the segmentation failed in a 12.5% of the experiments, whereas for a 5% rate, it failed in a 25% </plain></SENT>
