<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) is an inheritable and life-threatening disease; however, it is often difficult to determine disease characteristics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases with novel mutations, and more precise analysis is necessary for the successful development of evidence-based clinical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study thus sought to better characterize ion channel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We reprogrammed somatic cells from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> LQTS and from controls, and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes through embryoid body (EB) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological analysis of the LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs using a multi-electrode array (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) system revealed a markedly prolonged field potential duration (FPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IKr blocker E4031 significantly prolonged FPD in control- and LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs and induced frequent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> only in LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IKs blocker chromanol 293B did not prolong FPD in the LQTS-iPSC-derived EBs, but significantly prolonged FPD in the control EBs, suggesting the involvement of IKs disturbance in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp analysis and immunostaining confirmed a dominant-negative role for 1893delC in IKs channels due to a trafficking deficiency in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that iPSCs could be useful to characterize LQTS disease as well as drug responses in the LQTS patient with a novel mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such analyses may in turn lead to future progress in personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
