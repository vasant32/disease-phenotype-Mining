<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine procedural success and early and late complications in CRT patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> early (&lt;90 days) and late (&gt;90 days) complications occurring over 490 consecutive CRT procedures in 402 patients, from a large single-centre registry between 2000 and 2009 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up duration was 1012 ± 610 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, procedural data and long-term left ventricular (LV) lead performance were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of patients was 65 ± 15 years, 31% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of devices (70%) were CRT-defibrillators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead implantation was achieved after one or more than one attempt in 96.7% of patients (first procedure was successful in 95.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of early and late complications was 9.4% and 6.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> and lead displacement were the most common complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) was associated with significantly more complications than ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (P = 0.01) and these occurred later in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term LV lead performance was comparable with that of right atrial and ventricular leads.CONCLUSION: Transvenous implantation of the LV lead is safe and achievable for CRT with high procedural success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the first time we describe the late complications from CRT in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This group of patients must be kept under surveillance, not only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events but also for device-related issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reasons for higher complication rates in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients require further evaluation </plain></SENT>
