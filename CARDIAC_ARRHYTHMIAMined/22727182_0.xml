<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> replacement therapy (NRT) after ACS is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between NRT use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a pre-existing database, 663 smokers with ACS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were separated into the NRT (n = 184) or control (n = 479) groups according to whether NRT was prescribed on hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to account for the baseline differences between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 663 patients, 202 had adverse events in the first year after ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen with NRT use for the 1-year combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>), repeat revascularization, or rehospitalization for <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 1.30, p = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the individual 1-year end points of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 1.91, p = 0.61), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 2.06, p = 0.80), repeat revascularization (odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.36, p = 0.37), or rehospitalization for <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.53, p = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NRT use was not associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events in the first year after ACS </plain></SENT>
