<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Annually, ≈80,000 Americans receive guideline-based primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>), but appropriate firing rates are low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current selection criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> rely on left ventricular ejection fraction, which lacks sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because scar-related myocardial tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> is a substrate for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, we hypothesized that cardiac magnetic resonance identification of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> improves risk stratification through (1) its association with adverse cardiac events independent of clinical factors and biomarker levels and (2) its ability to identify particularly high- and low-risk subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 235 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic and nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤35% undergoing clinically indicated primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance was prospectively performed to quantify the amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> myocardial tissue (gray zone [GZ]) and dense core scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and other biomarkers were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> or cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which occurred in 45 (19%) patients at a 3.6-year median follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On univariable analysis, only <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, hsCRP, GZ, and core scar were associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, GZ and hsCRP remained independently associated with outcome (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the lowest tertile for both GZ and hsCRP (n=42) were at particularly low risk (0.7% per year event rate), whereas those in the highest tertile for both GZ and hsCRP (n=32) had an event rate of 16.1% per year, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> candidates, combining a myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> index with an inflammatory biomarker identified a subgroup with a very low risk for adverse cardiac events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This novel approach warrants further investigation to confirm its value as a clinical risk stratification tool </plain></SENT>
