<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the locations of these populations of primary and secondary myocardial pools suggests that some potential myocardial substrates (those producing outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>) initially had a primary phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cardiomyocytes forming pulmonary venous sleeves, substrates for many cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, have never possessed a primary phenotype </plain></SENT>
