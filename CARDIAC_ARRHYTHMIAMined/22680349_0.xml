<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) is a polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> occurring in the setting of a QT interval prolongation and is the most frequent type of drug-induced pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common mechanism of QT prolongation and TdP is blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier repolarizing <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> conductance IKr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesiologists have extensive experience with QT prolonging drugs, but there are relatively few reports of TdP occurring in the perioperative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, regulatory concern regarding the drug droperidol resulted in a significant reduction in its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concern regarding two other agents that potently block IKr, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi>, has grown, and practitioners are worried that these valuable agents may meet the same fate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, the data regarding the TdP risk of droperidol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> are compared with particular emphasis on the different settings in which they are employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the three drugs are potent IKr inhibitors, little evidence exists to suggest that droperidol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> are associated with significant proarrhythmia in the perioperative setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to factors such as inhibition of the parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and hypercarbia, and attention to serum electrolytes, TdP is a very rare occurrence in the perioperative environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">Methadone</z:chebi>, however, is typically given to outpatients, over long periods, and in combination with agents that inhibit its metabolism or are QT prolonging in their own right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, pre- and post-drug electrocardiograms may be appropriate when prescribing <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> for outpatients, while the much lower risk for TdP (and the difficulties inherent in QT measurement in the perioperative period) render this approach unfruitful and worthy of reevaluation </plain></SENT>
