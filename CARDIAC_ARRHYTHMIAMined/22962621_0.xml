<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) is a malignant inherited ion channel disorder predominantly caused by mutations in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the cellular characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> are investigated and whether the electrophysiological features of this mutation can be mimicked using iPSC -derived cardiomyocytes (CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Spontaneously beating CMs were differentiated from iPSCs derived from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patient carrying a P2328S mutation in RyR2 and from two healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calcium (Ca(2+)) cycling and electrophysiological properties were studied by Ca(2+) imaging and patch-clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potential (MAP) recordings and 24h-ECGs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-P2328S patients were analyzed for the presence of afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found defects in Ca(2+) cycling and electrophysiology in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> CMs, reflecting the cardiac phenotype observed in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catecholaminergic stress led to abnormal Ca(2+) signaling and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> CMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> CMs also displayed reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, indicating leakage of Ca(2+) from the SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp recordings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> CMs revealed both delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) during spontaneous beating and in response to <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> and also early afterdepolarizations (EADs) during spontaneous beating, recapitulating the changes seen in MAP and 24h-ECG recordings of patients carrying the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This cell model shows aberrant Ca(2+) cycling characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> and in addition to DADs it displays EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cell model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> provides a platform to study basic pathology, to screen drugs, and to optimize drug therapy </plain></SENT>
