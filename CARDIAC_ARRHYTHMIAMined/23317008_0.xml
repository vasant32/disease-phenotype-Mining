<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart functions are regulated by autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems through their transmitters and modulators, binding to cell surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, the cardiac M(3) muscarinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptor (M(3)-mAChR) has been studied for more than 2 decades since its first discovery in mammalian heart in 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The location and pathophysiological role of M(3)-mAChR in the cardiovascular system have been extensively studied and many pathways involved have been uncovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gain- and loss-of-function studies have revealed the ubiquitous roles of M(3)-mAChR in physiological and pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, many new findings have been uncovered about the relationship between M(3)-mAChR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, including <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>, pathological <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, cardiac conduction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the novel potential cardioprotective role of M(3)-mAChR against heart injury by regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been revealed in the most updated research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, the current new findings on the role of M(3)-mAChR in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> are updated, the downstream signaling pathways are summarized, perspectives and challenges of M(3)-mAChR as therapeutic targets are discussed </plain></SENT>
