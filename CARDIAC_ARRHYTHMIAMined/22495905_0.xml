<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The prenatal diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> can potentially reduce postnatal morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to evaluate prenatal cardiac diagnosis accuracy in a population referred for echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single centre retrospective study of echocardiography referrals between April 1999 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the prenatal and postnatal cardiac diagnoses, the modified Aristotle and Wald scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The final diagnosis Wald score was used to evaluate benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred fetuses were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart (312, 52%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> (CHD) (231, 38.5%); primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (39, 6.5%); or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumor</z:e> (18, 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prenatal and postnatal Aristotle and Wald scores correlated in 81% and 86%, respectively, each with significant differences in 22 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four significant CHDs were misdiagnosed, the surgical prediction was incorrect in 7 and 13 false positive diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 76% (455/600) fetuses prenatal diagnosis was considered beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average CHD Aristotle score was 9.5 ± 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In babies with CHDs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype the score was either 6.5 ± 5.0, 12.9 ± 3.1 or 13.2 ± 2.9, in survivors, cases of postnatal demise and cases of pregnancy termination, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis was accurate and the counselling appropriate in most cases; however, a few errors were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> remains challenging </plain></SENT>
