<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVES: Pre-clinical studies in swine have demonstrated that a supratherapeutic concentration of sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> decreased defibrillation efficacy and facilitated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore, decided to investigate the effects of Kaempferia parviflora (KP) extract on these parameters in the swine heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying assumption was that in the heart, KP might be producing effects similar to sildanafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> as KP has long been used in southeast Asian traditional medicine to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>erectile dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted as the defibrillation study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) induction study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both studies, the defibrillation threshold (DFT), the upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> threshold were determined before and after KP extract administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both studies KP extract at high concentrations (100 and 50 mg/kg) significantly increased the DFT and ULV, without altering the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At these concentrations, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: High concentrations of KP extract attenuated defibrillation efficacy and increased cardiac vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> swine heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When used in appropriate concentrations, its blood pressure lowering effect may be useful in hypertensive states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be done to elucidate its mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
