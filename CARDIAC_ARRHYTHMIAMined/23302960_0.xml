<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous data indicate that HU results in cardiac sympathovagal imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well established that cardiac sympathovagal imbalance increases the risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiac gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) is predominately expressed in the left ventricle (LV) and ensures efficient cell-to-cell electrical coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the current study we wanted to test the hypothesis that HU would result in increased predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and alter the expression and/or phosphorylation of LV-Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic data using implantable telemetry were obtained over a 10- to 14-day HU or casted control (CC) condition and in response to a sympathetic stressor using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> administration and brief restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arrhythmic burden was calculated using a modified scoring system to quantify spontaneous and provoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Western blot analysis was used to measure LV-Cx43 expression in lysates probed with antibodies directed against the total and an unphosphorylated form of Cx43 in CC and HU rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HU resulted in a significantly greater total arrhythmic burden during the sympathetic stressor with significantly more <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was increased expression of total LV-Cx43 observed with no difference in the expression of unphosphorylated LV-Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the increased expression of LV-Cx43 was consistent with the phosphorylated form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data taken together indicate that cardiovascular deconditioning produced through HU results in increased predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and increased expression of phosphorylated LV-Cx43 </plain></SENT>
