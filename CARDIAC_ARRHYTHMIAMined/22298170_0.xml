<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This paper describes the clinical outcomes from a novel direct access <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out in the north of Scotland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data was collected over a 29 month period between 18 June 2008 and 8 November 2010 from consecutive cases from two groups of patients, general practitioner (GP) direct access and 'redirected' consultant referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Monitor test results, frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> requiring further care and clinic attendances were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical differences were analyzed using Χ(2), Fisher's and Student's t-test as appropriate with the significance taken at the 0.05 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 239 patients were referred from 47 GP practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 165 (69%) referrals through the 'direct' and 72 (31%) through the 'redirected' route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average age was 55.5 ± 16.7 years with 84 (35.1%) males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>127 (53.1%) had a patient activated event recording and the remaining 112 (46.9%) had Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 239 patients, only nine (3.8%) cases required referral to a consultant cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, three were directly returned to GP care without consultant clinic review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were reviewed at cardiology clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct access for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring seems to provide an effective mechanism for diverting inappropriate or non-essential referrals away from the cardiology clinic </plain></SENT>
