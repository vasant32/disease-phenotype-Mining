<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We aim to study the SCN5A gene in a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BS) patients and evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BS is caused by mutations in up to 10 different genes, SCN5A being the most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large genomic rearrangements in SCN5A have been associated with conduction disease, but its prevalence in BS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six non-related patients with BS were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics and family risk profile were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of the SCN5A gene for identification of mutations and larger rearrangements were performed, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (10.5%) had point mutations (R27H, E901K, G1743R (detected in three families), V728I, N1443S and E1152X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with mutations had a trend toward a higher proportion of spontaneous type I Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) (87.5% vs 52.9%, p = 0.06) and had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> (62.5%, vs 23.5%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The symptoms and risk profile of the carriers were not different from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were non-significant differences in the prevalence of type I ECG, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in carriers of selected polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had any deletion/duplication in the SCN5A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 10.5% of our patients had mutations in the SCN5A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with mutations seemed to have more spontaneous type I ECG, but no differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or arrhythmic events compared with patients without mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are needed to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the SCN5A in the expression of the phenotype and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Large rearrangements were not identified in the SCN5A gene using the MLPA technique </plain></SENT>
