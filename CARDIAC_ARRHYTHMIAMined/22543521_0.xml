<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty deceased patients, who died in the emergency department during a period of 1 year, were subjected to needle autopsy of the major viscera, using spring-loaded automated biopsy gun, and the findings were correlated with clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deceased patients were in the age range of 12 to 80 years (mean [SD], 50.48 [18.41] years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tissues yielded from various organs were as follows: lungs, 90%; liver, 82%; kidney, 48%; heart, 28%; spleen, 22%; and pancreas, 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 86 clinical diagnoses were recorded, of which 21 (24%) (eg, metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo>) were impossible to verify on needle autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 new diagnoses, missed by physicians, were revealed by needle autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently missed diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver fatty change</z:e> (19 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other frequently missed diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (3 patients) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (2 patients: 1 lung <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major diagnostic errors (Goldman classes I and II) were noted in 16 (32%) of 50 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Needle autopsy can be a better alternative in the absence of conventional autopsy </plain></SENT>
