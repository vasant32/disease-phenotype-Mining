<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> with respect to provocation by exercise and drugs, electrocardiographic characteristics, and association with long-term outcomes; and to explore the relation between age and clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy patients from 16 families were evaluated with exercise and selective <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> challenge, and screened for RyR2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> was diagnosed in probands with symptoms and stress- or <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi>-provoked VT, or in asymptomatic relatives with provoked VT or RyR2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, VT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients including 16 probands were identified (median age 35 years, 67% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in 33% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 56%, and 11% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic or bidirectional VT was provoked with exercise in 63% and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> in 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The initiating beat of VT was late-coupled and wide (coupling interval 418 ± 42 ms; QRSd 131 ± 17 ms), and QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> suggested an outflow tract origin in 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 6.2 ± 5.7 years, 2 patients died despite an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), 4 patients received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy for VT, and 5 patients had inappropriate therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> (age &gt; 21; n = 10) were often female (80%) and less likely to have RyR2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">Ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor type 2) mutations (33%), and fatal events were not observed during follow-up (4.1 ± 3.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is often initiated from the outflow tract region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite β-blocker therapy and selective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, breakthrough <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occur and may be associated with adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
