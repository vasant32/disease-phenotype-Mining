<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether variations in NOS1AP affect drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Use of antiarrhythmic drugs is limited by the high incidence of serious adverse events including QT prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NOS1AP gene variants play a role in modulating QT intervals in healthy subjects and severity of presentation in LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study carried out an association study using 167 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) spanning the NOS1AP gene in 58 Caucasian patients experiencing drug-induced LQTS (dLQTS) and 87 Caucasian controls from the DARE (Drug-Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Risk Evaluation) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rs10800397 SNP was significantly associated with dLQTS (odds ratio [OR]: 3.3, 99.95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 10.8, p = 3.7 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The associations were more pronounced in the subgroup of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> users, in which 3 SNPs, including rs10800397, were significantly associated (most significant SNP: rs10919035: OR: 5.5, 99.95% CI: 1.1 to 27.9, p = 3.0 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We genotyped rs10919035 in an independent replication cohort of 28 amiodarone dLQTS cases versus 173 control subjects (meta-analysis of both studies: OR: 2.81, 99.95% CI: 1.62 to 4.89, p = 2.4 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of corrected QT interval among 74 control subjects from our dataset showed a similar pattern of significance over the gene region as the case-control analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This pattern was confirmed in 1,480 control subjects from the BRIGHT (British Genetics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Study) cohort (top SNP from DARE: rs12734991 in meta-analysis: increase in corrected QT interval per C allele: 9.1 ± 3.2 ms, p = 1.7 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first demonstration that common variations in the NOS1AP gene are associated with a significant increase in the risk of dLQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that common variations in the NOS1AP gene may have relevance for future pharmacogenomic applications in clinical practice permitting safer prescription of drugs for vulnerable patients </plain></SENT>
