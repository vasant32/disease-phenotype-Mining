<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its clinical benefit in elderly patients is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment in elderly patients and to identify markers of successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and risk factors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed multivariate analysis of a prospective long-term database from 2 tertiary care centers including 936 consecutive patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and risk factors for mortality were assessed in patients ≥75 years old at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 43 ± 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy were similar in the 2 age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy could be identified in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median estimated survival was 132 months in patients &lt;75 years and 81 months in those ≥75 years old (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased ejection fraction (hazard ratio 1.62 per 10% decrease, p = 0.03) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 1.57 per 10 ml/kg/m(2) decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, p = 0.02) were independent risk factors of mortality in patients ≥75 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, mortality of older patients was similar to that of the age-matched general population irrespective of delivery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is effective for treatment of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> may have limited impact on overall mortality in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar rate of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies, risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is increased 1.6-fold in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients ≥75 years old compared to younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with decreased ejection fraction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> are at highest risk </plain></SENT>
