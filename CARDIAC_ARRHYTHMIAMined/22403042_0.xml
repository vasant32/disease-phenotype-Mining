<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Catheter cryoablation (CRYO) may eliminate inadvertent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB) in the treatment of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, higher recurrence was observed with CRYO delivered by 4 mm or 6 mm-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to investigate whether a comparably low treatment failure and recurrence rate as in radiofrequency (RF) ablation is achievable by CRYO with an 8-mm-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study including 40 patients with AVNRT treated with CRYO (n = 20) using an 8 mm-tip catheter or RF ablation (n = 20) from March 2009 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment failure was defined as the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural failure including inadvertent permanent AVB and documented recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> procedural success of 90% (18/20) and 95% (19/20) were achieved in CRYO and RF ablation group, respectively (p = 0.998), with no permanent AVB in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups in terms of recurrence rate (5.6% [1/18] vs. 0%; log-rank test p = 0.304) and treatment failure (15% [3/20] vs. 5% [1/20]; log-rank test p = 0.301) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shorter fluoroscopy time (15 ± 8.6 vs. 25.2 ± 12.1 min; p = 0.005) and more energy applications (median 4 [2-15] vs. 2 [1-8]; p = 0.005) were observed in the CRYO group compared with RF ablation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to RF ablation, CRYO with an 8-mm-tip catheter for treating AVNRT achieves a comparable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural success, comparably low recurrence rate and composite endpoint of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shorter fluoroscopy time and more energy applications were observed in the CRYO group </plain></SENT>
