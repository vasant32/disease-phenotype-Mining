<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because changes in cardiac action potential (AP) are undesirable, the evaluation of the effects of test compounds on the AP is essential before advancing new compounds to clinical testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, an increase in repolarization duration alone is not always proarrhythmic, and newer surrogate markers have been suggested to better predict the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Described in this unit is a protocol for assessing changes in AP duration in canine ventricular myocytes utilizing optical imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This protocol can be used at an early stage of drug discovery due to its relatively fast throughput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a protocol is presented for assessing the occurrence of after-depolarizations, as well as a novel parameter for proarrhythmic risk, beat-to-beat variability of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This protocol can be used at a later stage of the drug discovery process to assess proarrhythmic potential </plain></SENT>
