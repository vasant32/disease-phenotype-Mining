<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More optimal pacing site may be found by invasive measurement of LV mechanical performance during pacing from different RV pacing sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the effect of RV pacing lead location on invasive indices of LV mechanical performance.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing catheter ablation for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-site endocardial pacing from the lateral LV region was periodically switched to pacing from the mapping catheter navigated to different RV sites within the three-dimensional electroanatomical RV map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SystIndex, DiastIndex, and PPIndex were defined as the ratio of LV dP/dtmax, LV dP/dtmin, and arterial pulse pressure during RV pacing to corresponding values from adjacent periods of LV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic data were analysed in 18 RV segments created by dividing RV horizontally (basal, mid, and apical portion), vertically (inferior, mid, and superior portion) and frontally (septum and free wall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (58 ± 7 years; 2 females; 26 ± 4 RV pacing sites per patient) were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with LV pacing, the best RV pacing values of SystIndex and DiastIndex were achieved in basal-mid-septal segment (+6.9%, P = 0.02 and +3.4%, P = 0.36, respectively) while the best PPIndex was obtained in superior-mid-septal segment of RV (+4.5%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> indices were fairly concordant showing significant improvement of haemodynamics during RV pacing in the direction from free wall to septum, from apex to base, and from inferior to superior segments.CONCLUSION: The best LV mechanical performance was achieved by RV septal pacing in the non-apical mid-to-superior segments </plain></SENT>
