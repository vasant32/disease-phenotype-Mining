<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients have drug contraindications or choose to avoid a lifetime of drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the impact of previous drug therapy on ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated AAD use before AF ablation and its impact on ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated freedom from AF after ablation and patients' clinical characteristics by number of AADs failed in 1125 patients undergoing 1504 ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated reasons why some patients did not receive prior drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis examined factors predicting ablation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients failing more drugs before ablation were older (P = 0.001), had a longer duration of AF (P = 0.0001), were more likely female (P = 0.037), had more repeat ablations (P = 0.045), and less paroxysmal AF (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF, the number of drugs failed predicted AF recurrence (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other factors predicting AF recurrence following final ablation included age (P = 0.004), left atrial size (P = 0.002), female gender (P = 0.0001), and persistent AF (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reason for not receiving prior drug therapy was medical in 21.5% and patient choice in 78.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Number of drugs failed did not influence ablation outcome for patients with long-standing persistent AF (P = 0.352) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For paroxysmal and persistent AF patients undergoing ablation, those failing fewer AADs have different clinical characteristics than those who fail more drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study also suggests that the more drugs failed pre-ablation, the lower the freedom from AF post-procedure, possibly due to AF progression during drug trials </plain></SENT>
