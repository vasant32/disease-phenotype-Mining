<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>Confusion</z:hpo> is possible with other primary breast lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a mass in her left breast 21 years after being diagnosed with invasive ductal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the right breast, treated by a right mastectomy and axillary dissection followed by radiotherapy and breast reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mammography revealed a dish-shaped <z:hpo ids='HP_0200036'>skin nodule</z:hpo> formation in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echography confirmed the presence of a lesion measuring 1.4 Ã— 0.8 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on imaging, the diagnosis was a probable <z:mp ids='MP_0003667'>angiosarcoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the presence of a pacemaker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and full anticoagulation therapy for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, magnetic resonance imaging and a biopsy were not done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We proceeded directly to a quadrantectomy and the final diagnosis revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_406'>dermatofibrosarcoma</z:mpath> protuberans, 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>8 cm in its greatest microscopic dimension, located 0.1 cm from the upper surgical margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To ensure the wide resection margins required for this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, a re-excision was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_406'>dermatofibrosarcoma</z:mpath> protuberans of the breast is an uncommon discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aim of this case report is to highlight the importance of the surgical procedure in cases of the discovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_406'>dermatofibrosarcoma</z:mpath> protuberans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Re-excision may be necessary to ensure adequate resection margins </plain></SENT>
