<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of formation of arrhythmogenic substrate in BrS is essential, namely for the risk stratification of BrS patients and their therapy which is still restrained almost exclusively to the implantation of cardioverter/defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of many crucial findings in this field published within recent years, the final consistent view has not been established so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, BrS described 20years ago remains an actual topic of both clinical and experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review presents an overview of the current knowledge related to the pathogenesis of BrS arrhythmogenic substrate, namely of the genetic basis of BrS, functional consequences of mutations related to BrS, and arrhythmogenic mechanisms in BrS </plain></SENT>
