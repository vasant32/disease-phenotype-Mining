<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is the basic and original sign of atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some evidences show that C-reactive protein (CRP) and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) play a pivotal role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of CRP on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the related mechanisms require elucidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The levels of basic total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, CRP, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were respectively measured in rabbits, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation function was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly divided into two groups: PVAT(-) and PVAT(+) group (removing or keeping pericarotid adipose tissue (PCAT)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of the two groups were exposed to a high-fat diet for six-week, and then sustained CRP treatment was performed for a week, at this time point <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above parameters were remeasured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) were respectively evaluated by Polymerase Chain Reaction and immunoblotting in PCAT and cultured adipocytes treated by CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-fat diet greatly increased the serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and inflammatory markers, induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and imbalance between NO and ET-1, increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of TNF-α, IL-6, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and enhanced macrophage infiltration of PCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRP treatment could further promote macrophage infiltration of PVAT, induce the imbalance between NO and ET-1, aggravate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> especially in PVAT(+) arteries, and could also enhance the above-mentioned <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression in PCAT and cultured adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRP could significantly promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in high-fat diet rabbits especially in PVAT(+) groups, which may be partly mediated by activating inflammatory reaction of adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
