<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp>) and intracristal <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> (icVSD) using the Shanghai Shape Memory Alloy (SHSMA) <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is still limited experience with transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> and icVSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2003 and September 2010, 348 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> and 47 patients with icVSD underwent transcatheter closure using a SHSMA <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total successful closure rate in <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> and icVSD subjects was 97.4 and 78.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the perioperative period, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> occurred in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> group, one case of occluder dislodgement, one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e>, and two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None in icVSD group had these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a median of 3.2 years of follow-up, there was no evidence of significant residual shunt and device-related valve regurgitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None in icVSD group and 10 patients (2.9%) in <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> group had a persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, only one patient (0.3%) with <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> acquired complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> requiring implantation of a permanent pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rim from the tricuspid valve to the defect &lt; 4 mm was the only predictor of arrhythmic complications after procedure (OR = 4.24; P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>pmVSD</z:mp> in selected patients using the SHSMA occluder is effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter closure of icVSD in experienced hands using this device is also feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
