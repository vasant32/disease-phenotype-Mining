<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography revealed an anomalous left main coronary artery (LMCA) originating from the right coronary ostium, and an occluded distal right coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occluded distal right coronary artery was successfully treated by thrombosuction and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to confirm the origin and course of the SCA, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) of the heart was performed after coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MSCT showed that the anomalous LMCA originated from the right coronary artery ostium and then passed the interventricular septum, instead of being intra arterial, and under the right ventricular infundibulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anomalous LMCA was classified as R-II S subtype according to Lipton's classification </plain></SENT>
