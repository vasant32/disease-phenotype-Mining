<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the characteristics and treatment of elderly patients hospitalized for COPD in Internal Medicine Services, compared with the younger age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational, prospective, multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the differences between patients older than 80 years and the rest regarding comorbidity, severity of COPD, previous admissions, length of stay and treatment prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was assessed by the Charlson index and a questionnaire was designed for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 398 subjects, 353 men (89%) with a mean age of 73.7 years (SD 8.8), of whom about 107 (26.9%) were older than 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had less severe COPD according to the GOLD classification (P&lt;.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the overall morbidity was similar in both groups, elderly patients had greater presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P&lt;.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (P&lt;.01) and received more <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dyspnoea, length of stay and mortality were similar between both populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Home oxygen therapy prior to and use of inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and oxygen therapy was lower in older patients, even when they were clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of patients hospitalized for COPD in Internal Medicine Services are over 80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although they present less obstruction, they have a similar degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, increased cardiac morbidity and their treatment is less consistent with the recommendations of the guidelines </plain></SENT>
