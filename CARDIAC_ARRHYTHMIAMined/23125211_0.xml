<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although inhomogeneity in regional sympathetic innervation is an acknowledged substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, the mechanism(s) responsible for these abnormalities in viable, dysfunctional myocardium (i.e., neural stunning vs. sympathetic denervation) and their association with nerve sprouting are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, markers of sympathetic nerve function and nerve sprouting were assessed in subendocardial tissue collected from chronically instrumented pigs with hibernating myocardium (n = 18) as well as sham-instrumented controls (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hibernating myocardium exhibited evidence of partial sympathetic denervation compared with the normally perfused region and sham controls, with corresponding regional reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase protein (-32%, P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> uptake transport protein (-25%, P = 0.01), and tissue <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> content (-45%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial denervation induced nerve sprouting with regional increases in nerve growth factor precursor protein (31%, P = 0.01) and growth associated protein-43 (38%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the changes in sympathetic nerve markers were similar in animals that developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (n = 9) compared with electively terminated pigs with hibernating myocardium (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sympathetic nerve dysfunction in hibernating myocardium is most consistent with partial sympathetic denervation and is associated with regional nerve sprouting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of sympathetic remodeling is similar in animals that develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> compared with survivors; this suggests that sympathetic remodeling in hibernating myocardium is not an independent trigger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, sympathetic remodeling likely contributes to electrical instability in combination with other factors </plain></SENT>
