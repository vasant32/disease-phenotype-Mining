<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (preop-AF) has been associated with poorer early and late outcomes after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies, however, have evaluated the impact of preop-AF on early and late outcomes after isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data obtained prospectively between June 2001 and December 2009 by the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database Program was retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent concomitant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery/ablation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and operative data were compared between patients undergoing isolated AVR who presented with preop-AF and those in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent effect of preop-AF on 12 short-term complications and long-term survival was determined using binary logistic and cox regression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isolated AVR surgery was performed in 2789 patients; 380 (13.6%) presented with preop-AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preop-AF patients were generally older (mean age, 73 vs 68 years; P &lt; 0.001) and presented more often with comorbidities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and cerebrovascular disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward increased 30-day mortality in patients with preop-AF on multivariate analysis (P = 0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of early complications was similar in both groups on multivariate analysis (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preop-AF was independently associated with reduced long-term survival (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.83; P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preop-AF is associated with an increased risk of late mortality after isolated AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As such, concomitant atrial ablation with AVR should be prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
