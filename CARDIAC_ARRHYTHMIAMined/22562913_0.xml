<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of the second-generation frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>-OCT) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The second-generation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>-OCT was recently developed, with simplified imaging technique and faster acquisition time compared to the first-generation time-domain OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the safety and effectiveness of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>-OCT has not been evaluated, and this study was conceived as a preapproval study for Food and Drug Administration clearance for clinical use in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 50 patients were enrolled from 3 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following stent implantation, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>-OCT was performed with contrast injection through the guiding catheter to acquire pullback images with the pressure-triggered automatic pullback device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was to achieve a median clear image length of more than 24 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serious procedure-related or postprocedural adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>) were recorded to assess safety of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary endpoint of obtaining &gt;24 mm of median clear image length (CIL) was achieved in 94% of the subjects (47 out of 50), with measured CIL of 43.2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients (10.6%), a second attempt was necessary due to suboptimal image quality of the first pullback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 36 patients (76.6%), a full stent length was obtained during the first attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no serious procedure-related or postprocedural adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new second-generation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e>-OCT system provides fast and reliable resolution images of the coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pullback can be safely performed over long segments of the artery without serious adverse events </plain></SENT>
