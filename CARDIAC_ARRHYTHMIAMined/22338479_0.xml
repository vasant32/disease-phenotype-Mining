<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>) it may be difficult to evaluate whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> is the cause or consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is very important to recognize <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> as a potentially reversible cause of myocardial dysfunction, because <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> suppression in these patients may lead to recovery of myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: An asymptomatic 24-year-old man with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> of left bundle branch <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with inferior axis was referred to our Department for further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic examination showed <z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>left ventricular dilation</z:mp> with reduced ejection fraction to 40%, while 24 h Holter-monitoring recorded 31,000 isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> refractory to drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the electrophysiologic study a <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>' focus in the right ventricular outflow tract was identified which was successfully resolved by radiofrequency catheter-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the procedure, considerable suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e> number to 2500/24 h was confirmed by Holter-recording, while complete recovery of left ventricular function was detected one month later by echocardiographic re-examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recognition of causal-resultant relation between frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> and progressive myocardial dysfunction is of primary importance for adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it has been believed for a long time that idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, in otherwise healthy persons, has a benign prognosis, there is evidence that frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> may present a reversible cause of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these patients catheter-ablation of arrhythmic focus is strongly recommended, because soon after the successful procedure recovery of myocardial function can be expected </plain></SENT>
