<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since radiofrequency (RF) energy is thought to be associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation than cryoenergy, the purpose of this study was to assess if the degree of activation of coagulation and inflammatory markers differed between ablation procedures performed with a cryoballoon catheter vs. a RF energy-based pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC), respectively.METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients referred for AF ablation were randomized to pulmonary vein isolation with either the cryoballoon or the PVAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers were studied for endothelial damage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen), platelet activation (soluble P-selectin), and coagulation activity [prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and D-dimer] at five different time points during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Troponin I (Trop I) and C-reactive protein were analysed to reflect myocardial destruction and inflammatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Markers of endothelial damage and platelet activation increased after ablation in both the cryo and the RF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the D-dimer levels increased significantly (P = 0.001) in both groups, whereas the F1 + 2 levels increased after the transseptal puncture only (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall activation of the coagulation system was, however, comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cryoballoon was associated with higher Trop I compared with the PVAC (P &lt; 0.001), but the ratios between biomarkers and Trop I were higher with the PVAC than with the cryoballoon.CONCLUSION: Even though the cryoballoon causes a higher degree of myocardial destruction than the PVAC, markers of coagulation, endothelial damage, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were comparable between the two techniques </plain></SENT>
