<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Radiofrequency catheter ablation is a successful treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but may lead to major complications such as permanent coronary damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new non-thermal ablation modality, but its effect on coronary arteries is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a porcine model, epicardial IRE lesions were created at the base of the left ventricle in four hearts (group A) and directly on the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in five hearts (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks, coronary arteries inside IRE lesions and in apparently undamaged myocardium next to the lesions were (immuno-)histologically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two untreated hearts served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronary damage was defined as intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left anterior descending artery angiograms were obtained before ablation, directly after ablation, and before termination in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group A, 103 arterial branches were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5 of 56 arterial branches inside lesions and 1 of 47 outside lesions showed intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had &lt;50% area stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Targeted LADs (group B) did not reveal intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and angiograms showed no signs of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of connective tissue growth factor was observed in the scar tissue, but not in the fibrotic tissue directly around the arteries, confirming that the arteries are indeed spared from tissue damage and remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coronary arteries remain free of clinically relevant damage 3 weeks after epicardial IRE ablation, even amid very large myocardial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This suggests that IRE ablation can be applied safely near or even on coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With IRE ablation, arterial blood flow does not appear to affect lesion formation </plain></SENT>
