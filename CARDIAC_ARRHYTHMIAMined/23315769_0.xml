<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical records of boxer dogs with a diagnosis of ARVC between 2000 and 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that median survival time (MST) was longer in younger ARVC dogs than in the older ones P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MST was statistically different (P=0.012) between dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (365 days) and dogs without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> episodes (693 days), the probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within a year being 4.8 times greater in dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (95% CI 1.48 to 15.99) than in dogs without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding Holter classification results, MST was 547.5 days in Holter class-2 dogs and 365 days in Holter class-4 dogs (P=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences regarding treatment options; MST was 365 days (95% CI 193.615 to 536.4) in the sotalol group, 365 days (95% CI 92.86 to 637.14) in the mexiletine plus atenolol group, and 547.50 days (95% CI 170.45 to 924.55) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi> group (P=0.383) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to this study, the best prognosis is for the younger boxer dog without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in survival times in relation to the different treatment options used </plain></SENT>
