<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to evaluate the image quality and effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-triggered adaptive systolic (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic) dual-source CTA versus prospectively triggered adaptive diastolic (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic) dual-source CTA in patients of unselected heart rate and rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective cohort study consisted of 41 <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic and 41 matched <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTA patients whom underwent clinically indicated 128-slice dual source CTA between December 2010 to June 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Image quality and motion artifact score (both on a Likert scale 1-4 with 4 being the best), effective dose, and CTDIvol were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability [HRV] on image motion artifact score and CTDIvol was analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 82 exams were considered diagnostic with 0 non-diagnostic segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic CTA patients had a higher maximum HR, wider HRV, were less likely to be in sinus rhythm, and received less beta-blocker vs. <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in effective dose was observed (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic vs. <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTA: 2.9 vs. 2.2 mSv, p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Image quality score (3.3 vs. 3.5, p &lt; 0.05) and motion artifact score (3.5 vs. 3.8, p &lt; 0.05) were lower in <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic CTAs than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic CTAs, an increase in HR was not associated with a negative impact on motion artifact score nor CTDIvol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTA, an increase in HR was associated with increased motion artifacts and CTDIvol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HRV demonstrated no correlation with motion artifact and CTDIvol for both <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-diastolic CTA and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic CTA yielded diagnostic examinations at unselected heart rates and rhythms with similar effective radiation, but <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>-systolic CTA resulted in more consistent radiation exposure and image quality across a wide range of rates and rhythms </plain></SENT>
