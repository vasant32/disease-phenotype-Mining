<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Segmental arterial mediolysis, an uncommon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disorder</z:e> most often occurring in the splanchnic muscular arteries of the abdomen, is a cause of catastrophic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its histology and initial clinical presentations suggested that it represented a localized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced vasospastic response to perturbations in vascular tone and blood volume distribution caused by coexisting vasoconstrictor conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, later presentations were at odds with some aspects of this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine greyhound dogs were administered a single dose of ractopamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two dogs developing persistent conduction abnormalities with biochemical evidence of heart injury were euthanized and necropsied--one 4 days and the other 17 days after dosage This report is based on findings and comparisons of the canine abdominal and coronary arteries to segmental arterial mediolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesions having features of early-injurious-stage segmental arterial mediolysis were identified in the canine arteries 4 days postractopamine, and arteries examined after 17 days showed alterations typically occurring in reparative-stage segmental arterial mediolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suspected that ractopamine, a Beta-2 adrenergic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, created segmental arterial mediolysis by neuromodulating the peripheral sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to release <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> of efferent nerves serving splanchnic arteries that stimulate alpha-1 receptors to induce injury at the adventitial medial junction and medial muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This finding and other cited examples suggest that segmental arterial mediolysis may be a disorder principally caused by iatrogenic or accidental exposure to alpha-1 adrenergic receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> or Beta-2 agonists able to release <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> from the peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
