<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the intermediate term follow up results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 60 pediatric patients (mean age = 12.4 ± 5.3 years, ranged from 3 years to 18 years; male: female = 37:23; mean body weight was 32.02 ± 12.3 kg, ranged from 14 kg to 60 kg) with clinically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> underwent an electrophysiologic study (EPS) and RF catheter ablation at Children's Hospital Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt during the period from January 2008 to December 2009 and they were followed up until October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> included atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT; n = 45, 75%), atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT; n = 6, 10%), and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT; n = 9, 15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The success rate of the RF catheter ablation was 93.3% for AVRT, 66.7% for AVNRT, and 77.8% for AT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications were infrequent (7/60, 11.7%), (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> during RF catheter ablation (4/60, 6.6%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> during RF catheter ablation (1/60, 1.6%); transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> during RF catheter ablation (2/60, 3.3%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was 8.3% (5/60) during a follow-up period of 34 ± 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RF catheter ablation is an effective and safe method to manage children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
