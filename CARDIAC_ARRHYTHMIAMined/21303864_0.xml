<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pericardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> are intrathoracic lesions usually considered to be congenital and less frequently to be acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are normally found incidentally upon chest radiography, computed tomography (CT)-scan or echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are usually asymptomatic and have a benign behavior although sometimes they can cause clinical symptoms and diagnosis can be uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present, herein, the case of a 51-year-old male with a history of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> resistant to transcatheter ablation therapies with an accidental finding of a pericardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> adherent to the lateral wall of the right atrium at the emerging superior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was studied with transesophageal echocardiography, CT-scan and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with the evidence of dimensional increasing of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> at seriate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering this, in the absence of a definitive diagnosis and suspecting a link between the mass and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was surgically removed through median sternotomy, off-pump on a beating heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative course was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic examination confirmed it was a mesothelial pericardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months of follow-up the patient is doing well and he is in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we believe that, although the majority of pericardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> need only radiological and clinical follow-up, surgical resection should be performed when the patient is symptomatic and when diagnosis is uncertain </plain></SENT>
