<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prevalence has been reported during controlled <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> studies in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus hypothesized that serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (sMg) concentrations are inversely associated with the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> in adults at high cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anthropometric, demographic and lifestyle characteristics were assessed in 750 Cree adults, aged &gt; 18 yrs, who participated in an age-stratified, cross-sectional health survey in Quebec, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Holter electrocardiograms recorded heart rate variability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> for two consecutive hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between sMg and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> prevalence in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> (sMg ≤ 0.70 mmol/L) was more than twice that of adults without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> (50% vs. 21%, p = 0.015); results were similar when adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> history were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hypomagnesemic adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> declined across the sMg concentration gradient in adults with T2DM only (p &lt; 0.001 for linear trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate logistic regressions adjusted for age, sex, community, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and cholesterol lowering drug use, and blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> concentrations, the odds ratio of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> among T2DM subjects with sMg &gt; 0.70 mmol/L was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.06-0.98) p = 0.046 compared to those with sMg ≤ 0.70 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sMg concentrations were inversely associated with the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> in patients with T2DM in a dose response manner, indicating that suboptimal sMg may be a contributor to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> among patients with T2DM </plain></SENT>
