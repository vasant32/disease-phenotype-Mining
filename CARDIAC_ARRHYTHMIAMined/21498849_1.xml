<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimization of device settings may maximize benefit on an individual basis, although the best method for this is not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the use of cardiogenic impedance measurements (derived from intracardiac impedance signals) in CRT device optimization, using invasive left ventricular (LV) dP/dtmax as the reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen patients underwent invasive haemodynamic assessment using a pressure wire placed in the LV cavity at the time of CRT device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracardiac impedance measurements were made at different atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays and compared with LV dP/dtmax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the performance of patient-specific and generic impedance-based models in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, LV catheterization with the pressure wire was unsuccessful and in two patients LV lead delivery was unsuccessful; therefore, data were acquired for 13 out of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular dP/dtmax was 919±182 mmHg/s at baseline and this increased acutely (by 24%) to 1121±226 mmHg/s as a result of CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient-specific impedance-based model correctly predicted the optimal haemodynamic response (to within 5% points) for AV and VV delays in 90 and 92% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiogenic impedance measurements are capable of correctly identifying the maximum achievable LV dP/dtmax as measured by invasive haemodynamic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that cardiogenic impedance can potentially be used for CRT optimization and may have a role in ambulatory assessment of haemodynamics </plain></SENT>
