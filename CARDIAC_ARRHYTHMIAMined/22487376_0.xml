<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the antiarrhythmic effects of vasostatin-1, a recently identified cardioregulatory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, in canine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 13 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs bilateral thoracotomies allowed the attachment of multielectrode catheters to superior and inferior pulmonary veins and atrial appendages (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rapid atrial pacing (RAP) was maintained for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each hour, programmed stimulation was performed to determine the window of vulnerability (WOV), a measure of AF inducibility, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the last 3 hours, vasostatin-1, 33 nM, was injected into the anterior right (AR) ganglionated plexus (GP) and inferior right (IR) GP every 30 minutes (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven dogs underwent 6 hours of RAP only (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, 100 mM, was applied on the right AA and AF duration was recorded before and after injection of vasostatin-1, 33 nM, into the ARGP and IRGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate experiments (n = 8), voltage-sinus rate response curves (surrogate for GP function) were constructed by applying high-frequency stimulation to the ARGP with incremental voltages with or without vasostatin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vasostatin-1 significantly decreased the duration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced AF (11.0 ± 4.1 vs 5.5 ± 2.6 min, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative WOV (the sum of individual WOVs) significantly increased (P &lt; 0.0001) during the first 3 hours and decreased toward baseline in the presence of vasostatin-1 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cumulative WOV in controls steadily increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vasostatin-1 blunted the slowing of sinus rate with increasing stimulation voltage of ARGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vasostatin-1 suppresses AF inducibility, likely by inhibiting GP function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data may provide new insights into the role of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> neuromodulators for AF therapy </plain></SENT>
