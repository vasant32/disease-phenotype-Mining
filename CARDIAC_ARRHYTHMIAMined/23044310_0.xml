<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been proved that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> postconditioning (SpostC) could protect the heart against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, however, there has been few research focused on the electrophysiological effects of SpostC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of SpostC on action potential duration (APD) and L-type calcium current (I(Ca, L)) in isolated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Langendorff perfused SD rat hearts were randomly assigned to one of the time control (TC), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R, 25 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion), and SpostC (postconditioned with 3% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of reperfusion, epicardial myocytes were dissociated enzymatically for patch clamp studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi> directly prolonged APD and decreased peak I(Ca, L) densities in epicardial myocytes of the TC group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I/R injury shortened APD and decreased peak I(Ca, L) densities in epicardial myocytes of the I/R group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SpostC prolonged APD and increased peak I(Ca, L) densities in epicardial myocytes exposed to I/R injury (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SpostC decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and decreased reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores compared with the I/R group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SpostC attenuates APD shortening and I(Ca, L) suppression induced by I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The regulation of APD and I(Ca, L) by SpostC might be related with intracellular ROS modulation, which contributes to the alleviation of reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
