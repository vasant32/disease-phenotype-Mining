<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The heart's rhythm is initiated and regulated by a group of specialized cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in the development of the SAN can result in irregular heart rates (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although several of the critical genes important for SAN formation have been identified, our understanding of the transcriptional network controlling SAN development remains at a relatively early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 is involved in the specification and patterning of the SAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the Shox2 knockout in mice results in <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> due to severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> including improper SAN development, Shox2 knockdown in zebrafish causes a <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to gain deeper insight into molecular pathways involving Shox2, we compared gene expression levels in right atria of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and Shox2 (-/-) hearts using microarray experiments and identified the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Islet1 (Isl1) as one of its putative target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The downregulation of Isl1 expression in Shox2 (-/-) hearts was confirmed and the affected region narrowed down to the SAN by whole-mount in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using luciferase reporter assays and EMSA studies, we identified two specific SHOX2 binding sites within intron 2 of the ISL1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also provide functional evidence for Isl1 as a transcriptional target of Shox2 by rescuing the Shox2-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> phenotype with Isl1 using zebrafish as a model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate a novel epistatic relationship between Shox2 and Isl1 in the heart with important developmental consequences for SAN formation and heart beat </plain></SENT>
