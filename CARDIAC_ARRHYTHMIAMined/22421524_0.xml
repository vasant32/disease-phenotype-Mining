<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ARVC/D has been associated with mutations in genes encoding myocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, only 30%-50% of patients have mutations in these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing is useful in obtaining a diagnosis, particularly in individuals who do not completely fulfill clinical criteria, thereby also enabling the undertaking of preventive strategies in family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main goal of this study was to identify mutations in candidate genes associated with intercalate disks that could be potentially involved in ARVC/D pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyze a cohort of 14 Spanish unrelated patients clinically diagnosed with ARVC/D without any genetic alteration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously known responsible genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a genetic screening has been performed in 7 additional potential candidate genes (ACTC1 -actin alpha cardiac muscle 1-, CDHN -cadherin 2 type 1 or N-cadherin-, CTNNA1 -catenin alpha 1-, Cx43 or GJA1 -gap junction protein alpha 1-, MVCL -Metavinculin-, MYL2 -myosin light chain 2- and MYL3 -myosin light chain 3-) by direct sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our genetic analysis did not identify any disease-causing mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty single <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> polymorphisms were found, six of them novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our ARVC/D Spanish cohort has not shown any mutations in the analyzed candidate genes despite their involvement in formation and maintenance of the intercalated disk </plain></SENT>
