<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function has been widely tested using electrical bioimpedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the reproducibility of cardiac functional parameters in subjects performing Müeller maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen apparently healthy males were tested on three different days in a protocol requiring their performance of forced and sustained inspiratory efforts against a closed epiglottis (Müeller maneuver-MM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On each day, the protocol included performance of two simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo> of 30 seconds, with at least 3 minutes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Changes from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing baseline for cardiac output, heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume were comparable during both MM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation was similar on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new contemporary bioimpedance cardiography device provided reliable measures of dynamic cardiac responses during a simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> event </plain></SENT>
