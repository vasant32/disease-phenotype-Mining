<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Linear ablation lesions are used to treat a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, successful long-term outcome is hampered by both the uncertainty of catheter-tissue contact for any individual lesion and the difficulty in ensuring point-to-point lesion contiguity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A novel virtual electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter equipped with an endoscope to directly visualize the target tissue was used to ensure tissue contact and lesion contiguity along the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) to treat typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this feasibility study of five patients with drug-resistant CTI-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, catheter ablation was performed using the visualization virtual electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After standard femoral access, the ablation catheter was advanced to the tricuspid annulus under fluoroscopic and intracardiac echocardiography guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three of five patients, the ablation procedure was performed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>; the other two ablations were during coronary sinus pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conversion to sinus rhythm was noted after the delivery of 12 ± 7 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional CTI conduction block was successfully achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial, transient CTI block was first observed after delivering 19 ± 13 lesions; ultimately, 34 ± 18 lesions were required to achieve permanent bidirectional CTI block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean ablation and procedure times were 72 ± 42 and 151 ± 17 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean fluoroscopy times for the ablation alone and the entire procedure were 13 ± 8 and 17 ± 7 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces the clinical feasibility of a novel paradigm for contiguous linear ablation: virtual electrode ablation under direct endoscopic visualization </plain></SENT>
