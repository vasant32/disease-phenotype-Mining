<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate the feasibility of radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrioventricular node reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and the ideal site for slow pathway (SP) ablation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> referred for catheter ablation of atrioventricular node reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single His potential was recorded in 8 patients (89%, 6 {S,L,L} and 2 {I,D,D}) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earliest atrial activation during retrograde atrioventricular node conduction occurred at His bundle region (HBE; n=7) or shifting from HBE to coronary sinus ostium (n=1, {S,L,L}) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two anatomically separate His potentials were recorded in 1 patient (11%, {S,L,L}), one at the anteroseptum (HBE-1) and the other at the confluence of the pulmonary and mitral annulus (HBE-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases with a single His potential recorded, SP was abated at the posterior-midseptum, 2 ({S,L,L}) at the right posteroseptum, 1 ({S,L,L}) at the left posteroseptum, and 5 (3 {S,L,L} and 2 {I,D,D}) at the midseptum after failure of energy application at the posteroseptum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Junctional rhythm was observed during radiofrequency catheter ablation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patient with 2 anatomically separate His potentials recorded, SP was successfully ablated from the confluence of the pulmonary and mitral annulus, slightly below the HBE-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Junctional rhythm was also induced during radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In {S,L,L} or {I,D,D}, radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrioventricular node reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SP input region can mainly be found in the posterior midseptum, especially in patients with single penetrating atrioventricular nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SP could usually be successfully ablated in these regions </plain></SENT>
