<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS), only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> has been consistently reported to have a beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recommended doses are ≥ 1 g/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> has been suggested on the basis of a few isolated experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the efficacy and safety of doses ≤ 600 mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> after cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in BrS at 2 referral centers and to compare those results with a comprehensive review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of medical records from the 2 centers, 6 men with BrS who received ≤ 600 mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> or hydroquinidine after cardioverter-defibrillator implantation were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi> was initiated after arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or appropriate shocks, including arrhythmic storm in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A literature search was performed to find previous cases with symptomatic BrS reported as having received ≤ 600 mg/d of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi> prevented recurrence of VA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from our series without side effects during a median follow-up of 4 years (from 2 to 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the literature review, 14 additional adults were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of 3, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> effectively suppressed arrhythmic events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four subjects who discontinued the medication experienced VA recurrence, successfully treated by restarting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> were well tolerated and effective to prevent the recurrence of VA, including arrhythmic storm, in subjects with BrS with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> or hydroquinidine in doses ≤ 600 mg/d is 85% </plain></SENT>
