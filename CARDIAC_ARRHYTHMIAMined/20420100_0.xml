<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors retrospectively reviewed 1,193 cases (mean age 45, 41% male) performed in the electrophysiology laboratory at Ramathibodi Hospital from 1996 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Success rate, recurrence rate and complications were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ablations of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT, 428 cases, 35.9%) and atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT, 346 cases, 29%) were the most common procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate and recurrence rate of RFCA were 88.8% and 6.1% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 50 patients (4.2%) with 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RFCA of AVNRT or AVRT rather than other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (Odd ratio 11.46, 95% confidence interval 8.14-16.15, p &lt; 0.001) and adult rather than pediatric patients (Odd ratio for age 1.007, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.011, p &lt; 0.001) were independent predictors for successful RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFCA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in our institution is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
