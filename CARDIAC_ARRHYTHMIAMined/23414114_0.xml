<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>More than 300 variants in 12 genes have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) which has a prevalence ranging between 1:2000 and 1:100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, there has been little knowledge regarding the distribution of genetic variations in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This problem was partly solved, when exome data from the NHLI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) was published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to report the prevalence of previously BrS-associated variants in the ESP population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a search in ESP for variants previously associated with BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, four variants in ESP were genotyped in a second Danish control population (n = 536) with available electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ESP, we identified 38 of 355 (10%) variants, distributed on 272 heterozygote carriers and two homozygote carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genes investigated were on average screened in 6258 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a surprisingly high genotype prevalence of 1:23 (274:6258) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotyping the four common ESP-derived variants CACNA2D1 S709N, SCN5A F2004L, CACNB2 S143F, and CACNB2 T450I in the Danish controls, we found a genotype prevalence comparable with that found in ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that exome data are used in research, as an additive tool to predict the pathogenicity of variants in patients suspected for BrS </plain></SENT>
