<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We investigated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden, left atrial volume (LAV) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-pro-BNP) at baseline and after long-term follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 38 patients (23 paroxysmal, 6 women, mean age 56 ± 11) scheduled for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LAV was calculated on the basis of computed tomography images at baseline and long-term follow-up, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden was graded from self-reported frequency and duration of AF episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean period of 22 ± 5 months, 28/38 patients (11/15 persistent) were free from AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At baseline there were no differences in mean LAV (125 vs. 130 cm(3), p = 0.7) or median NT-pro-BNP (33.5 vs. 29.5 pmol/L, p = 0.9) between patients whose ablation had been successful or otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow-up, there was a marked decrease in LAV (105 vs. 134 cm(3), p &lt; 0.05) and level of NT-pro-BNP (7 vs. 17.5 pmol/L, p &lt; 0.05) in the successful ablation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NT-pro-BNP correlated with LAV both at baseline (r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001) and at follow-up (r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden correlated with both NT-pro-BNP (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01) and LAV (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A decrease in NT-pro-BNP at follow-up of &gt;25% of baseline value had a specificity of 0.89 and a sensitivity of 0.6 (receiver operator characteristics, accuracy 0.82) for ablation success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NT-pro-BNP correlates with LAV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden in AF patients and both NT-pro-BNP and LAV decrease significantly after successful ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A decrease in NT-pro-BNP of &gt;25% from the baseline value could be useful as a marker of ablation success </plain></SENT>
