<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described the clinical usefulness of the presence of nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) and defined heart rate turbulence (HRT) in stratifying patients at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively assessed whether HRT can facilitate the predictive accuracy of NSVT for identifying patients at risk for serious arrhythmic events in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 299 consecutive patients with LV dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40%) including ischemic (n = 184) and nonischemic causes (n = 115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of NSVT was assessed on Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRT was simultaneously measured from Holter ECGs, assessing two parameters: turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRT was considered positive when both TO and TS were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The end point was defined as of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NSVT was documented in 93 patients (32.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For HRT assessment, 17 patients (5.6%) were not utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 282 patients, 68 (24.1%) were HRT positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 960 ± 444 days, 14 patients (5.0%) reached the end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NSVT, HRT, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly associated with the end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, NSVT had the strongest value for the end point, with an HR of 4.4 (95%CI, 1.4-14.3; P = 0.0138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When NSVT combined with HRT, the predictive accuracy is more increased, with an HR of 8.2 (95%CI, 2.9-23.3; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The predictive values of the combination were higher than single use of NSVT or HRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HRT can facilitate the predictive accuracy of NSVT for identifying patients at risk for serious arrhythmic events in patients with LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
