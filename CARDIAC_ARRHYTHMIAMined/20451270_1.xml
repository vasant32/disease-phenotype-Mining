<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We combined high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to compare the atrial proteome of subjects with AF versus controls with sinus rhythm (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify novel differentially regulated proteins that could be related to the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human atrial appendage tissue samples from patients undergoing heart surgery with AF or SR were analyzed by high-resolution 2-DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proteins of interest were identified by MS and validated by western blotting and inmunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis allowed the detection of over 2300 protein spots per gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following differential image analysis, we found 22 spot differences between the AF and SR groups in the 4-7 isoelectric point range, leading to the identification of 15 differentially regulated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main group of proteins identified was that of heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>), including TRAP-1, HspB3, HspÎ’6 and AHA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the differences detected between AF and SR for the above proteins were due to post-translational modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified the structural protein fibulin-1 as down-regulated in atrial tissue from AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution 2-DE analysis of human atrial tissue revealed that AF is associated with changes in structural proteins and an important number of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lower expression of the structural protein fibulin-1 in atrial tissue from AF patients might reflect the myocardial structural changes that take place in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
