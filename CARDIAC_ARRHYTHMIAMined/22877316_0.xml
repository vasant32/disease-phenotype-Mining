<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present work introduces two different Wavelet Transform (WT) applications to electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first one predicts spontaneous termination of paroxysmal AF (PAF), whereas the second one deals with the prediction of electrical cardioversion (ECV) outcome in persistent AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the central tendency measure (CTM) from the first differences scatter plot was applied to the AF wavelet decomposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this way, the wavelet coefficients vector CTM associated to the AF frequency scale was used to assess how atrial fibrillatory (f) waves variability can be related to AF events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Structural changes into the f waves can be assessed by combining WT and CTM to reflect atrial activity organization variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This fact can be used to predict organization-related events in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To this respect, results in the prediction of PAF termination regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 91.67% and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, for ECV outcome prediction, 82.93% sensitivity, 90.91% specificity and 85.71% accuracy were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, CTM has reached the highest diagnostic ability as a single predictor published to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that CTM can be considered as a promising tool to characterize non-invasive AF signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this sense, therapeutic interventions for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF patients could be improved, thus, avoiding useless procedures and minimizing risks </plain></SENT>
