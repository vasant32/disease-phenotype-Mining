<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>Cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> is accompanied by reprogramming of gene expression, where the altered expression of ion channels decreases electrical stability and increases the risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we analysed the role of the depolarizing current I(f) which has been hypothesized to contribute to arrhythmogenesis in the hypertrophied ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We used transverse aortic constriction in mice to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an increased number of I(f) positive ventricular myocytes as well as a strongly enhanced and accelerated I(f) when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the four HCN (hyperpolarization-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi>-gated channels) isoforms mediating I(f), HCN2 and HCN4 were the predominantly expressed subunits in healthy as well as hypertrophied hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, only the HCN1 transcript was significantly upregulated in response to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the combined deletion of HCN2 and HCN4 disrupted ventricular I(f) completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lack of I(f) in hypertrophic double-knockouts resulted in a strong attenuation of pro-arrhythmogenic parameters characteristically observed in hypertrophic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, prolongation of the action potential was significantly decreased and lengthening of the QT interval was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the strongly increased HCN channel activity in hypertrophied myocytes prolongs the repolarization of the ventricular action potential and thereby may increase the arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results provide for the first time a direct link between an upregulation of ventricular I(f) and a diminished repolarization reserve in <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
