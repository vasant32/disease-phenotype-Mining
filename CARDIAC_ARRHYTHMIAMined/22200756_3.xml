<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, cellular therapy for end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> has been emerging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein report a 56-year-old male who received a transplant of autologous myoblast sheets manufactured in temperature-responsive culture dishes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His clinical condition improved markedly, leaving him without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and able to discontinue using a left ventricular assist system and avoid cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cellular therapy using myoblast sheets is a promising new strategy for treating patients with end-stage <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method might be an effective alternative to heart transplantation in the near future </plain></SENT>
