<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The appropriate treatment strategy for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) remains challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe a case series of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and complex septal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> who underwent percutaneous correction using a FIGULLA (Occlutech) septal occluder (FSO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Ten consecutive patients (6 females, 4 males, mean age 41.6 ± 16.0 years, range 17-52 years; group 1) with cryptogenetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and complex septal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, as defined by intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) were compared with a group of 25 patients (10 females, 15 males, mean age 43.7 ± 12.3 years; group 2) with usual tunnel-like <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> was closed by an Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO; AGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between group 1 and group 2 for immediate success rate, residual intraprosthetic shunt at the end of the procedure, discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months follow up, number of attempts, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, or cardiac complication (atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, device embolism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference was shown for delivery sheath size (11 ± 2 versus 9 ± 1 F) and incidence of local <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (30% versus 12%) between group 1 and group 2, without any clinical consequence (need of transfusion) or increase in length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FSO shows high performance in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and complex septal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> when compared with patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> and uncomplicated atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> treated by ASO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its favorable behavior is probably related to fabric features such as the total amount of metal and the presence of <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
