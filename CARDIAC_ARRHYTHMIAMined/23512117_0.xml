<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reverse remodeling of the left atrium (LA) following successful pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) recovery after successful PVI has never been demonstrated systematically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to retrospectively analyze the effectiveness of PVI in patients with AF on recovery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prior to PVI, patients underwent a clinically indicated CMR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-PVI (6 ± 2 months), patients underwent a follow-up MRI and were classified into two groups-responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to PVI-as assessed by cessation of AF at the end of the prespecified 6-month (14-day "P" sensitive event monitor defined) follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CMR was used to evaluate the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (0 to 4+) and to relate changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> to LA volumes as well as mitral apparatus geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who had mild and higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (2+) on baseline CMR and had a post-PVI CMR were selected for final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the consecutive 122 patients with AF who underwent PVI, 74 patients that had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> on initial CMR were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these74 patients with AF with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, 52 (70 %) were classified as R and 22 (30 %) were classified as NR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographics were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with mild to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, pre vs. post in the R group <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> severity significantly improved (mean = 2.3, median = 2.0 vs. mean = 1.0, median = 1.0, p &lt; 0.0001) and was matched by favorable reverse remodeling of the mitral apparatus geometry (annulus = 35 ± 4 vs. 33 ± 3 mm, p &lt; 0.002; tenting area = 175 ± 56 vs.137 ± 37 mm(2), p &lt; 0.003; tenting height = 8 ± 2 vs.7 ± 2 mm, p &lt; 0.02; and tenting angle = 129 ± 10° vs. 131 ± 11°, p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in the NR subgroup, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> failed to improve (mean = 2.2, median = 2.0 vs. mean = 1.5, median = 1.0, p = NS) and paralleled general failure of mitral geometry reverse remodeling (annulus = 35 ± 4 vs. 35 ± 4 mm, p = 0.2; tenting area = 153 ± 39 vs. 152 ± 34 mm(2), p = NS; tenting height = 7 ± 1 vs. 7.0 ± 2, p = 0.1; and tenting angle = 131 ± 11° vs. 133 ± 10°, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In those with lesser degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, favorable remodeling was predicated on responder status to PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, other cardiac dimensions pre- to post-PVI favorably improved in the R group, but not in the NR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In those with durable maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR), cardiac reverse remodeling demonstrated by 3D CMR occurs and is matched by marked improvements in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and mitral apparatus, likely contributing to continued maintenance of NSR </plain></SENT>
