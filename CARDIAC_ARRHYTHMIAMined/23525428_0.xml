<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reliable data regarding absolute and relative risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and graft failure after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in renal transplant patients are unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Renal transplant patients undergoing inpatient CABG (n=1400) or PCI (n=4097) were identified from United States Renal Data System data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of nonfatal graft failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was reported for observed events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Cox model with the Fine-Gray method was used to account for competing risks in assessing relative hazards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age and race were similarly distributed; patients who underwent CABG were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> but less likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> on index admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was more frequent after CABG (5.6% versus 3.0%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, graft failure, and the combined outcome at 3 years were 23.1%, 15.4%, and 38.5% after CABG and 22.9%, 13.3%, and 36.1% after PCI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analyses, CABG was not associated with increased risk of graft failure versus PCI during the first 6 months (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43) or from 6 to 36 months (0.98, 0.78 to 1.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increased after CABG during the first 3 months (1.37, 1.08 to 1.73), but decreased from 6 months on (0.76, 0.63 to 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CABG does not appear to be associated with a difference in risk of graft failure compared with PCI in renal transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with PCI, adjusted risk of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is higher after CABG; however, mortality from 6 months on is lower </plain></SENT>
