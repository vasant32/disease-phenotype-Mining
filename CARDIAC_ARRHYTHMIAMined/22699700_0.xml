<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The index E/e' derived from tissue Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler is the ratio of the early transmitral flow velocity and the early mitral annular velocity and it correlates with left ventricular filling pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between intraoperative E/e' and postoperative cardiovascular complications and length of ICU and hospital stays after a non cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This observational study investigated a total of 82 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> undergoing non cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diastolic function was evaluated by conventional echocardiographic pulsed-wave Doppler and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early peak (E) as well as the late peak (A) filling velocity of the left ventricle (LV) were measured at the mid-esophageal four-chamber at the mitral leaflet tips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early Peak diastolic filling velocity (e'), Late peak diastolic filling velocity (a') and systolic velocity (s') were obtained from the mid-esophageal four-chamber view placed in the septal and lateral mitral annular sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were divided into three groups: E/e'&lt;8 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV filling pressure= 24 patients), E/e' 8-15 (moderately increased =35 patients) and E/e'&gt;15 (severely increased = 23 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An elevated E/e' ratio was significantly associated with increased postoperative cardiovascular events, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> (P&lt;0.05) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) and with longer ICU and hospital stays (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This data suggests that the tissue Doppler index E/e' may be a useful indicator for predicting morbid events after non-cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with an elevated intraoperative E/e' may need more careful postoperative management </plain></SENT>
