<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the causes without autopsy is frequently incorrect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 175 cases of adult hospital patients in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System, who died suddenly and unexpectedly, were investigated with autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common cause was judged to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, in 58 (33%) of cases, presumptive in 46 cases, because only 12 of these patients were on cardiac monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients, 36 (62%) had â‰¥75% <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> and 31 (53%) had histological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, with 15 (26%) of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> lacking a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> was judged the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 38 (22%) of cases, including 31 (82%) with endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, anticoagulation, or antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was judged the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 27 (15%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> deserves better appreciation as a cause of sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of hospitalized adults </plain></SENT>
