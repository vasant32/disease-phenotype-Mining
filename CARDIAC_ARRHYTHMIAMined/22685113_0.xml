<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, Na(V)1.5, plays a pivotal role in setting the conduction velocity and the initial depolarization of the cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF was associated with genetic variation in SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The coding sequence of SCN5A was sequenced in 192 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight nonsynonymous mutations (T220I, R340Q, T1304M, F1596I, R1626H, D1819N, R1897W, and V1951M) and 2 rare variants (S216L in 2 patients and F2004L) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 11 genopositive probands, 6 (3.2% of the total population) had a variant previously associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> type 3 (LQTS3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LQTS3-associated variants in the patients with lone AF was much higher than expected, compared with the prevalence in recent exome data (minor allele frequency, 1.6% versus 0.3%; P=0.003), mainly representing the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional effects of the mutations were analyzed by whole cell patch clamp in HEK293 cells; for 5 of the mutations previously associated with LQTS3, patch-clamp experiments showed an increased sustained <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, suggesting a mechanistic overlap between LQTS3 and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 10 identified mutations and rare variants, we observed compromised biophysical properties affecting the transient peak current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF, we identified a high prevalence of SCN5A mutations previously associated with LQTS3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional investigations of the mutations revealed both compromised transient peak current and increased sustained current </plain></SENT>
