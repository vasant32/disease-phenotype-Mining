<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the pore forming subunit KV4.3 leading to an increase in the transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (Ito) have previously been associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we aim to determine if mutations in KV4.3 or in the auxiliary subunit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> Channel-Interacting Protein (KChIP) 2 are associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and nine unrelated early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF patients (&lt;40 years) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entire coding sequence of KCND3 and KCNIP2 was bidirectionally sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One novel non-synonymous mutation A545P was found in KCND3 and was neither present in the control group (n = 432 alleles) nor in any publicly available database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of persistent AF at the age of 22, and no mutations in genes previously associated with AF were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological analysis of KV4.3-A545P expressed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 cells, revealed that peak-current density was increased and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of inactivation was slower compared with WT, resulting in a significant gain-of-function both in the absence and the presence of KChIP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Gain-of-function mutations in KV4.3 have previously been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada Syndrome</z:e>, however, this is the first report of a KV4.3 gain-of-function mutation in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association of KV4.3 gain-of-function and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF further supports the hypothesis that increased <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current enhances AF susceptibility </plain></SENT>
