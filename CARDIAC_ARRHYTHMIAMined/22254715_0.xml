<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A very precise wavelet transform based ECG delineator was developed to detect PP, PR and RR time series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean PR variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and SCD group was found to be significantly high as compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was observed that when PR variations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and SCD cases crossed a certain threshold, RR variability no longer provided a very accurate estimate of HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such cases, PP variability was able to provide a better assessment of HRV </plain></SENT>
