<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the gold standard treatment for OSA; its impact on atrial electrical remodelling has not been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signal-averaged p-wave (SAPW) duration is an accepted marker for atrial electrical remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP induces reverse atrial electrical remodelling in patients with severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients attending the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sleep Disorder</z:e> Clinic at Kingston General Hospital underwent full polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OSA-negative controls and severe OSA were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) &lt; 5 events/hour and AHI ≥ 30 events/hour, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SAPW duration was determined at baseline and after 4-6 weeks of CPAP in severe OSA patients or without intervention controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen severe OSA patients and 10 controls were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean AHI and minimum oxygen saturation were 41.4 ± 10.1 events/hour and 80.5 ± 6.5 % in severe OSA patients and 2.8 ± 1.2 events/hour and 91.4 ± 2.1 % in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At baseline, severe OSA patients had a greater SAPW duration than controls (131.9 ± 10.4 vs 122.8 ± 10.5 ms; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After CPAP, there was a significant reduction of SAPW duration in severe OSA patients (131.9 ± 10.4 to 126.2 ± 8.8 ms; p &lt; 0.001), while SAPW duration did not change after 4-6 weeks in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CPAP induced reverse atrial electrical remodelling in patients with severe OSA as represented by a significant reduction in SAPW duration </plain></SENT>
