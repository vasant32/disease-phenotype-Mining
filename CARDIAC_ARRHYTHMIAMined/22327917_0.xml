<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The exact incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> is unknown, as the diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation and disease course are extremely variable, as there may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, or cardiogenic shock, or progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in patients with bioptically proven <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> at presentation and after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients with different presentations of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> (20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, 20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 16 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent B-mode echocardiography (echo) and tissue Doppler imaging, coronarography, ventriculography, endomyocardial biopsy and contrast-enhanced MRI examination, as well as clinical and echo follow-up at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, patients were divided in two groups according to values of end-systolic volume and ejection fraction: patients with negative remodelling and those with positive remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late enhancement was found to be an independent predictor of negative remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced MRI is useful both in the diagnosis and as a prognostic indicator in the clinical suspicion of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
