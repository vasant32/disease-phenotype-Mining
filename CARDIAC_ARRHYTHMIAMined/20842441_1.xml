<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many researchers have prompted considerable interests in developing therapeutic approaches for its control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In present study, we want to determine whether that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> pre- and postconditioning have protective effects on sinoatrial node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury on <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score, serological markers (CK-MB and cTnT), SOD activities, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels and expression of HCN4 channels in SA node cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score recorded, whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> used in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or reperfusion, the total number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was significantly reduced, as well as the number of its episodes was also markedly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also shown a clear correlation between HCN4 channels expression and the dysfunction of SA node cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HCN4 immunoreactivity decreased after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> pre- and postconditioning, but changes were significantly smaller in the cells of the SA node compared with cells of I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The content of cTnT, CK-MB and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> pre- and postconditioning group reduced significantly; but the level of SOD increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological examination and electron microscopy observations found in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> pre- and postconditioning group sinoatrial node injury also mitigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> pre- or postconditioning were to reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism was to stabilize the SA node cells membrane and one possible mechanism involves modulation of HCN4 channels in pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node </plain></SENT>
