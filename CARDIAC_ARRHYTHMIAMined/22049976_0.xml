<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimal placement of the right ventricle (RV) lead during biventricular pacing has not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Greater electrical separation (ES) between left ventricle (LV) and RV leads has been associated with better clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The site of maximal electrical separation(<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) in the RV is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study of 50 CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LV lead was placed in a postero-lateral branch of the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ES was recorded at 6 sites within the RV during LV pacing at 600 milliseconds cycle length (CL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median ES was recorded with a roving deflectable catheter at the RV outflow tract (RVOT), high septum, inflow septum, mid-septum, apical septum and apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 67 ± 7 years, 39 were male (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty had ischemic etiology (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 25 ± 7%, QRS duration pre and post was 165 ± 26 milliseconds and 138.5 ± 15.6 milliseconds (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mapping ES showed a difference between 20 and 50 milliseconds distributed across the RV in the majority of patients (40/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, 7 subjects demonstrated delay distribution of between 50 and 82 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ES was significant greater in the RV mid-septum (161.2 ± 23.7 milliseconds) compared with RVOT (154.1 ± 20.8 milliseconds) and apex (148.0 ± 25.5 milliseconds; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The site of Maximal ES was most commonly found at the mid-septum (40 patients, 80%) and only rarely at the RVOT (5, 10%) and apex (5, 10%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was observed most commonly at the RV septum and rarely at the RV apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Better correction of electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony by CRT may be achieved by placing the RV lead in a site outside of the apex in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies exploring RV septal pacing in CRT seem warranted </plain></SENT>
