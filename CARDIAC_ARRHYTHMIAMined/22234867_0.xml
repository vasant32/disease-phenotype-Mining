<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The influence of inter-electrode spacing (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi>) on complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) and dominant frequency (DF) detection was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bipolar electrograms were recorded via an octapolar catheter (2-mm electrode spacing) from left atrial CFAEs sites in 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CFE-mean was calculated at <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> of the electrode pairs 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, and 1-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DF, regularity index (RI), and organization index (OI) were simultaneously analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CFE-mean decreased as the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> increased (from 71 ± 15 ms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-2 to 61 ± 8 ms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-3, 57 ± 6 ms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-4, 57 ± 8 ms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-5, and 58 ± 9 ms of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-6, respectively; <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-2 vs. 1-3 to 1-6, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DF was unchanged (6.6 ± 1.6 Hz for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; P &gt; 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the RI decreased as the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> increased (from 0.30 ± 0.11 to 0.26 ± 0.11, 0.23 ± 0.11, 0.22 ± 0.12, and 0.20 ± 0.12; <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-2 vs. 1-3 to 1-6, P &lt; 0.01), as did the OI (from 0.39 ± 0.14 to 0.34 ± 0.12, 0.32 ± 0.13, 0.29 ± 0.13, and 0.28 ± 0.13; <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> 1-2 vs. 1-3 to 1-6, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A wider <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> might detect dyssynchronous activations, leading to a reduced CFE-mean and RI and OI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, bipolar signals recorded with a narrower <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16411">IES</z:chebi> might be preferable to more precisely localizing CFAEs and DF sites </plain></SENT>
