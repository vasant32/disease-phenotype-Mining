<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, with approximately 840,000 people suffering from it nationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>People with AF have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> which can be mitigated effectively with the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, evidence suggests that less than 50% of eligible patients are receiving this form of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to assess the published evidence in order to understand why clinicians and patients underutilize an effective intervention such as anticoagulation in favor of the less effective antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The decision to use <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> drugs in patients with AF involves a consideration of the potential benefits versus the risks, inconveniences, and costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is however widespread variation in the importance placed on these factors across primary care practices, individual doctors and between and within different patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of literature designed to examine patient expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Available studies suggest that patients are prepared to be placed at a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> than their prescribing doctors would be prepared to accept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that this judgement depends on a range of factors, it is not surprising that attempts to understand clinician's barriers to prescribing take precedence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The barriers to anticoagulation can be identified, but we still don't understand the importance that clinicians and individuals give them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These barriers continue to limit the use of anticoagulation therapy, a potentially beneficial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to these limitations it is unclear what impact the increased range of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and the alternation to the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) will have on the incentive to primary care physicians to anticoagulate those at risk </plain></SENT>
