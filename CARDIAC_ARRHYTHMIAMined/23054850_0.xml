<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2006 through July 2011, newborns admitted to the NICU for NA or diagnosed as NA after hospitalization were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The newborns with non benign NA were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, the incidence of non-benign NA was 0.7 % (n = 55/7880) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 16.7 ± 1.8 d ranging from 1 d to 90 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common type was <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) with an incidence of 0.3 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses showed that there were significant differences between the survived and died infants according types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates were higher among infants with obstructive type left-to right shunt and common mixing type CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most dangerous type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> could not be noticed at neonatal period even in NICU, implying that it is increasingly important for the physician to be aware of the etiology, development, and natural history of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
