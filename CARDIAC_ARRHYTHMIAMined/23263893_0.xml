<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Optimal left ventricular (LV) lead position has emerged as an important determinant of response after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparatively, strategy for right ventricular (RV) lead optimization remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three variations of RV lead position (apex, mid-septal, and high septal) were tested in seven consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At each location, intra-procedural measurement of LV lead electrical delay (LVLED) was obtained during intrinsic rhythm and RV pacing (RV-LVLED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous cardiac output assessment was performed using the LiDCO™ (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48607">lithium chloride</z:chebi> indicator dilution) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final RV lead location was selected based on best-measured cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjustment of RV lead position after securing a LV lead site led to an incremental change of 30 ± 18 % (range, 7-52 %) in the cardiac index (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was substantial variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response (∆CI, 14 ± 13 %; range, 3-41 %) seen with pacing from each patient's worst to best RV lead position; no single RV lead position emerged as optimal across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Paced RV-LVLED was not correlated with percent change in CI (r = 0.18; p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LV ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly (28 ± 4 to 40 ± 8 %, p = 0.006) at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LVLED measured during intrinsic rhythm, but not during RV pacing, correlated with percent change in LVEF (r = 0.88, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RV lead position adjustment can be used to enhance <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response during CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Measurement of paced RV-LVLED, however, does not reliably predict change in cardiac output </plain></SENT>
