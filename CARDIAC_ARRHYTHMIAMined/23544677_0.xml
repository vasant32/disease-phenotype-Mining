<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method: Cardiac preejection period (PEP), an index of sympathetic-linked cardiac activity, and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), an index of parasympathetic-linked cardiac activity, were assessed among 99 preschool children (ages 4-6 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> both at rest and in response to behavioral challenge, before participants and their parents completed 1 of 2 versions of the Incredible Years parent and child interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: Main effects of PEP activity and reactivity and of RSA activity and reactivity were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although samplewide improvements in behavior were observed at posttreatment, those who exhibited lengthened cardiac PEP at rest and reduced PEP reactivity to incentives scored higher on measures of conduct problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> both before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, children who exhibited lower baseline RSA and greater RSA withdrawal scored lower on prosocial behavior before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, children who exhibited greater RSA withdrawal scored lower on emotion regulation before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We discuss these findings in terms of (a) individual differences in underlying neurobiological systems subserving appetitive (i.e., approach) motivation, emotion regulation, and social affiliation and (b) the need to develop more intensive interventions targeting neurobiologically vulnerable children </plain></SENT>
