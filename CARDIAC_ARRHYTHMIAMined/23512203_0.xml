<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is associated with poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In such patients, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation of VT is currently recommended only as an adjunctive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whether a successful VT ablation alone might be a viable strategy in some of these patients, however, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Between January 2002 and December 2011, 189 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> underwent 259 VT ablations in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (mean age, 65.2±9.6 years; 91% men) with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 39.7±9.7% matched the study criteria and were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was obtained in 40 of 45 patients (88.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up, on the basis of our stepwise algorithm (using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success, repeat electrophysiological study, and recurrence of VT), 19 of 45 patients (42.2%) underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillators implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 4.5 (interquartile range, 2.1-7.0) years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality occurred in 14 of 45 patients (31.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.22; P=0.007) was the only independent predictor of mortality, whereas implantable cardioverter-defibrillators implantation was not (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-1.64; P=0.28) Conclusions- Our results suggest that a stepwise approach to the management of VT with ablation as a first-line treatment in postinfarct patients presenting with VT might be a reasonable option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
