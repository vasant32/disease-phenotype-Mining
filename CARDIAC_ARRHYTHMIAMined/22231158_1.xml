<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find the magnetic field interference thresholds for several commonly used pacemaker models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 16 pacemakers from three different manufacturers with the frequency range of 2 to 1,000 Hz, using sinusoidal, pulse, ramp, and square waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The magnetic fields were produced by a computer-controlled Helmholtz coil system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pacemaker malfunction occurred in six of 16 pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interaction developed almost immediately after high-intensity magnetic field exposure started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With each waveform, at least two pacemakers exhibited interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most exposure settings, there was no interference at magnetic field levels below the international occupational safety limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, some frequencies using ramp or square waveforms interfered with pacemakers even at levels below public exposure limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of interference depended greatly on the waveform, frequency, magnetic field intensity, and the sensing configuration of the pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unipolar configurations were more susceptible for interference than the bipolar ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, magnetic fields perpendicular to the pacemaker loops were more likely to cause interference than parallel fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a need for further investigations on pacemaker interference caused by different external magnetic fields to ensure safe working environment to workers with a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
