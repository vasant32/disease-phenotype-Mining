<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a novel light treatment consisting of phase advance and phase delay photic stimuli given on 2 successive nights was used to induce circadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the Siberian hamster ( Phodopus sungorus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether loss of rhythms in behavior was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> within the suprachiasmatic nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29425">(SCN)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> tissue samples were obtained at 6 time points across 24 h in constant darkness from entrained and arrhythmic hamsters, and per1, per2 , bmal1, and cry1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were measured by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The light treatment eliminated circadian expression of clock genes within the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi>, and the overall expression of these genes was reduced by 18% to 40% of entrained values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> in per1, per2, and bmal1 was due to reductions in the amplitudes of their oscillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that these data are compatible with an amplitude suppression model in which light induces singularity in the molecular circadian pacemaker </plain></SENT>
