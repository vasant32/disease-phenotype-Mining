<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among a larger series of patients included in the BS database of our Department, 179 patients undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> challenge were included in the study and categorized in two groups according to age: group 1 (&lt;18 years old) and group 2 (â‰¥18 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and results of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> challenge of each group were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Young individuals were more often asymptomatic compared to adult patients (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They showed a higher number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECGs (P = 0.023), a lower percentage of Brugada type II electrocardiographic pattern compared to the adult population (P = 0.011), and a comparable amount of spontaneous Brugada type III electrocardiographic pattern (P = 0.695) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">Ajmaline</z:chebi> provoked a higher degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction delay</z:e> (P = 0.002) and higher degree of prolongation of the ventricular repolarization phase (P = 0.013) in young individuals but its pro-arrhythmic risk was comparable in the two groups (P = 0.684) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in young patients with a positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> test was comparable to that of the adults with a positive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> test (P = 0.694) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the low-risk profile of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> test in young patients when performed by experienced physicians and nurses in an appropriate environment </plain></SENT>
