<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The primary goal of this observational clinical study was to register the occurrence of incorrect inflation and deflation timing of an intra-aortic balloon pump in autoPilot mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The secondary goal was to identify possible causes of incorrect timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During IABP assistance of 60 patients, every four hours a strip was printed with the IABP frequency set to 1:2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strips were examined for timing discrepancies beyond 40 ms from the dicrotic notch (inflation) and the end of the diastolic phase (deflation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this way, 320 printed strips were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 52 strips (16%) showed incorrect timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On 24 of these strips, the incorrect timing was called incidental, as it showed on only one or a few beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 28 cases of erroneous timing were called consistent, as more than 50% of the beats on the strip showed incorrect timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 69% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of incorrect timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When timing was correct, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was found on 13 (5%) of 268 strips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A poor quality electrocardiograph (ECG) signal showed on 37% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strips with incorrect timing and 11% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strips with proper timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that inflation and deflation timing of the IABP is not always correct when using the autoPilot mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The quality of the ECG input signal and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> appear to be related to erroneous timing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Switching from autoPilot mode to operator mode may not always prevent incorrect timing </plain></SENT>
