<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We presented a novel experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model for studies in left ventricular (LV) reconstruction techniques and assessed LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In eight pigs, the LV radius and geometry were enlarged surgically on the beating heart by inserting an aortic allograft construct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamics and LV dimensions were assessed by echocardiography at baseline and under dobutamine stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery was successfully performed without lethal blood loss or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV end-diastolic and end-systolic short-axis areas increased from 13.0 ± 1.7 to 17.0 ± 4.3 cm(2) (P = 0.001) and from 4.0 ± 0.9 to 13.0 ± 2.6 cm(2) (P = 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume decreased from 56 ± 11 to 33 ± 16 ml (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incremental dobutamine infusion concurred with a biphasic response on fractional area shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral valve insufficiency</z:hpo> ranging from grades 2 to 4 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the pig, a novel, reproducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac dysfunction was created on the beating heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Innovative (surgical) strategies for (staged) reconfiguration of the ventricle, e.g. adjustable Dor procedures and stepwise volume restraining cardiac support devices, can be tested for efficacy using this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
