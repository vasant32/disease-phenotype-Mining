<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A possible effect of β-blockers on substrate metabolism has also been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The direct effects of β-blockers on mouse C2C12 cells were investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and differentiated into myotubes in the same medium that contained 1% FBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">Palmitic acid</z:chebi> oxidation and glycolysis were measured by using [9,10-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> and [5-(3)H]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of (3)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi> was measured as an indicator of substrate usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">Carvedilol</z:chebi> (100 µmol/L) inhibited <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> oxidation and increased glycolysis by nearly 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> altered substrate metabolism in a similar fashion as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> were devoid of metabolic effects </plain></SENT>
