<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite refinements in techniques and devices, peri- and post-procedural antithrombotic therapy remains pivotal to prevent early and late thrombotic events, without unduly increasing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> has been considered until recently the standard of care in terms of oral antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, most recently a novel and more potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37942">thienopyridine</z:chebi>, prasugrel, has been tested in randomized trials including patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, and subsequently approved for clinical practice in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite its potent antithrombotic effect, prasugrel also carries a statistically significant increase in the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, especially in the elderly, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low body weight</z:hpo>, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of prasugrel, as well as that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> or ticagrelor, should best be individualized to maximize clinical benefits and minimize hazards </plain></SENT>
