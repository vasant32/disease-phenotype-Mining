<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants included 28 young children (mean age = 37.79 months) that were born premature and presented with elevated externalizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess cardiac vagal regulation, resting measures of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and RSA change (withdrawal or suppression) to a clean-up task were derived pre and post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that an increase in behaviors mothers are taught to use during treatment (i.e., do skills-praise, reflection, and behavioral descriptions) was associated with an improvement in children's post-treatment RSA suppression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study illustrates the important role of caregiver behavior in promoting physiological regulation in children born premature </plain></SENT>
