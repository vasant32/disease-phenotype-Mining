<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine if strain measures [peak systolic longitudinal strain (LAS) and stiffness index (LASt)] changed after cardioversion (CV); and their relation to AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 46 participants with persistent AF and 41 age-matched participants with no AF were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAS and LASt were measured before and immediately after CV using 2D speckle tracking imaging (2DSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maintenance of sinus rhythm was assessed over a 6-month follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean LAS was lower, and mean LASt higher, in participants with AF before CV as compared to control group (11.9±1.0 vs 35.7±1.7, p&lt;0.01 and 1.31±0.17 vs 0.23±0.01, p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the mean LAS immediately after CV (11.9±1.0 vs 15.9±1.3, p&lt;0.01), whereas mean LASt did not change significantly after CV (p=0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although neither LAS nor LASt were independently associated with AF recurrence during the follow-up period, change in LAS after cardioversion (post-CV LAS-pre-CV LAS) was significantly higher among individuals who remained in sinus rhythm when compared to individuals with recurrent AF (3.6±1.1 vs 0.4±0.8, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAS and LASt differed between participants with and without AF, irrespective of the rhythm at the time of echocardiographic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline LAS and LASt were not associated with AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, change in LAS after CV may be a useful predictor of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
