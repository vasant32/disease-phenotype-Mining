<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some researchers had already suggested that additional identification of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) around the areas with a positive reaction to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) might improve the accuracy of GP's boundaries location, then enhancing the success rate of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of GP ablation directed by HFS and CFAE in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-two patients with PAF (age 57Â±8 years) underwent GP ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ablation targets were the sites where vagal reflexes were evoked by HFS and additional extended ablation CFAE area around the areas where vagal reflexes were evoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 71% of patients were free of symptomatic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months after ablation the root mean square successive differences and HF were significantly lower in patients without AF recurrence (P &lt; 0.0001 and P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in patients without AF recurrence (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enhanced GP ablation directed by HFS and CFAE can be safely performed and enables maintenance of sinus rhythm in the majority of patients with PAF for a 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Denervation of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system may be the preferable target of catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
