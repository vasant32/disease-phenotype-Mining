<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e>, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in Latin America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue therapy has been investigated as a possible therapeutic option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of therapy with mesenchymal stem cells in an experimental model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Chagasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1000 trypomastigotes from the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and, after six months of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, were treated with mesenchymal human stem cells from adipose tissue (STAT) or with Dulbecco/Vogt modified Eagle's minimal essential medium - DMEM (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treated group received two intraperitoneal injections of STAT (1x10(6) cells/dose), with a month interval between the two doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before and after the first and second months of treatment, the chagasic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control animals underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were sacrificed under anesthesia after two months of treatment for histopathological analysis of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No improvement was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and cardiovascular function in the group of animals treated with STAT; however, sections of mice hearts in this group revealed a significant reduction in the number of inflammatory cells (p&lt;0.0001) and areas of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (p&lt;0.01) in comparison with chagasic animals treated with DMEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thus, it is concluded that administration of intraperitoneal STAT can reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the heart of mice chronically infected with T. cruzi; however, there were no effects on the cardiac function two months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
