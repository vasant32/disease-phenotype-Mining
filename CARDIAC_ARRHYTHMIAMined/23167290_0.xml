<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intramyocardial dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> might appear as a component of the rupture during the evolution process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The description of the myocardium as a helical muscular band facilitates the explanation of the fiber dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With echocardiography, it is possible to diagnose intramyocardial dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (IDH), determine its location, progression, potential complications, and in some cases its reabsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to search for neocavitations in the infarcted myocardium and identify the intramyocardial edge that surrounds the defect, as well as the flow inside the myocardial dissection, the pathway of the dissection, and its communication with ventricular cavities, and also to look for the complete or partial reabsorption of the cavitary image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greater the myocardial dissection is, the worse the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> is confined to the apical segments, it is more likely to reabsorb spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue characterization with magnetic resonance during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> allows identification of reperfusion injuries with altered microcirculation and intramyocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to search for IMH in reperfused patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206145" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stunned myocardium</z:e>, and no reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients may develop an increased stiffness in the infarcted wall and a major likelihood to develop a parietal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Everything seems to indicate that we are facing the same physiopathological process which can be characterized by 2 complementary imaging methods, echocardiography and magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
