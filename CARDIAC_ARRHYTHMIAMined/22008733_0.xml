<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin is a novel growth hormone-releasing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, which has been shown to exert beneficial effects on ventricular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether ghrelin could decrease vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and the possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after ligation of the anterior descending artery, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to ghrelin (100 Î¼g/kg) and saline (control group) for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham animals underwent thoracotomy and pericardiotomy, but not LAD ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels were significantly elevated in saline-treated rats at the border zone compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial connexin43 (Cx43) expression at the border zone was significantly decreased in saline-treated infarcted rats compared with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin significantly decreased the inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias compared with control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> sores during programmed stimulation in saline-treated rats were significantly higher than scores in those treated with ghrelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological improvement of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias was accompanied with increased immunofluorescence-stained Cx43, myocardial Cx43 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in ghrelin treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also shown that ghrelin significantly decreased tissue ET-1 levels at the infarcted border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, ghrelin showed the protective effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanism by which ghrelin modulates the dephosphorylation of Cx43 remains unknown, it is most likely that the ghrelin increased expression of Cx43 through the inhibition of ET-1 </plain></SENT>
