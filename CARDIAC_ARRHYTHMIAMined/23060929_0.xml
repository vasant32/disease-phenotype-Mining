<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Small-scale studies have reported on the treatment of APL using one or two treatment regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a multiple center-based study of 119 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279641" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric APL</z:e> treated with four regimes based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (ATRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratorial test results and treatment outcome of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279641" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric APL</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regime 1 used an in-house developed protocol, regime 2 was modified from the PETHEMA LPA99 protocol, regime 3 was modified from the European-APL93 protocol, and regime 4 used a protocol suggested by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall complete remission rates for the four regimes were 88.9, 87.5, 97.1 and 87.5%, respectively, which exhibited no statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, more favorable results were observed for regimes 2 and 3 than regimes 1 and 4, in terms of the estimated 3.5-year disease-free survivals, relapse rates, drug toxicity (including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and differentiation syndrome) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the overall outcomes were more favorable after treatment with regimes 2 and 3 than with regimes 1 and 4, and this may have been due to the specific compositions of regimes 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
