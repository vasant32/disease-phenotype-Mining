<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, clinical scientific studies have evidenced the relevant connections between cardiac alternans and the risk of heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsus alternans was described in detail for the first time in its meaning as clinical sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> by Ludwig Traube in 1872 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traube had great competence in physical semeiotics and, besides being considered one of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founders</z:e> of experimental pathology, this German internist accurately presented a situation characterised by a succession of higher and lower pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not by chance that one of the current synonyms of pulsus alternans is precisely Traube's pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present clinical-historical approach has been selected not only for diachronic purposes, but also to illustrate, on epistemological grounds, the notable articulation and considerable complexity of an only apparently straightforward concept such as that of pulsus alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its comprehension has undergone progress and its definition evolution, and the expression has included through time different physiologic, pathophysiologic and pathologic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although now a century and a half old, the concept of pulsus alternans remains extremely modern and fascinating </plain></SENT>
