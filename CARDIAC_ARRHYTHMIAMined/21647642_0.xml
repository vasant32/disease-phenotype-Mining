<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> has remained a therapeutic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, recent advances in the treatment of the reflex syncopal syndromes are (1) the recognition that many pharmacologic and device-based treatments do not really work, (2) complex subdivisions among the reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> types can be simplified, and (3) effective therapies are often common sense applications of behavioral modifications and physical maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many of the treatments have been available for decades and have been supplemented by a renewed interest in the physiologic approach while maintaining a role for evidence-based pharmacologic and device-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Streamlined workups in dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> centers may be effective, both economically and therapeutically </plain></SENT>
