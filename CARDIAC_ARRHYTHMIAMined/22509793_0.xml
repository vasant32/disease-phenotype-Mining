<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> male residents aged 20-61 years and female residents aged 20-56 years were invited to the Troms√∏ Study in 1986-1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 15,558 participants free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were prospectively followed over 20 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QT interval at baseline was measured on lead I of the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per standard deviation change in QT interval were calculated using a Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 756 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 1,183 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>Prolonged QT interval</z:mp> was present in 792 (5%) participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QT interval was not associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84-1.07, after adjustment for potential confounders) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heart-rate-corrected QT interval was a significant predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in men (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.29), but not in women (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.91-1.18), after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the previously observed relationship between QT interval and increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is not mediated by increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical utility of the QT interval to identify individuals at high risk for coronary events is limited in a general population without prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
