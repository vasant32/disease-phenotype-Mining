<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of defibrillator recipients experience multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> episodes over a short period of time, termed electrical storm (ES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current therapeutic strategy for ES is complex and unsatisfactory because simultaneous administration of several medications and additional invasive procedures are often required to control ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this treatment does not favorably influence the long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clearly, improved ES therapies are necessary and desirable, but a lack of understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ES has hindered the development of more effective, rationally based therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews emerging experimental and clinical findings that provide insights into the pathophysiology of ES and discusses mechanism-based innovative therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
