<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a trend toward decreasing length of hospital stay (LOS) after TKA although it is unclear whether this trend is detrimental to the overall postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such information is important for future decisions related to cost containment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined whether decreases in LOS after TKA are associated with increases in readmission rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the rates and reasons for readmission and LOS for 4057 Medicare TKA patients from 2002 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We abstracted data from the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical generalized linear modeling was used to assess the odds of changing readmission rates and LOS over time, controlling for changes in patient demographic and clinical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall readmission rate in the 30 days after discharge was 228/4057 (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 10 most common reasons for readmission were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (20.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (13.9%), cardiac dysrhythmias (12.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (10.8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0003560'>osteoarthrosis</z:mp> (9.4%), general symptoms (7.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (7.0%), care involving other specified rehabilitation procedure (6.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (6.3%), and disorders of fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance (5.9%); the top 10 causes did not include venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no difference in the readmission rate between the periods 2002-2004 (5.5%) and 2005-2007 (5.8%) but a reduction in LOS between the periods 2002-2004 (4.1 ± 2.0 days) and 2005-2007 (3.8 ± 1.7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common causes for readmission were cardiac-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A reduction in LOS was not associated with an increase in the readmission rate in this sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimization of cardiac status before discharge and routine primary care physician followup may lead to lower readmission rates </plain></SENT>
