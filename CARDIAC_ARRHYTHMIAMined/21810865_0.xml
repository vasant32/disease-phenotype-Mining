<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pharmaceutical companies are generally interested in this important group of patients and a relatively large number of antiarrhythmic agents are under development for several indications relating to AF, predominantly rhythm and rate management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the significant clinical consequences of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, it has been recognized that controlled trials in patients with AF should assess the effect of therapy in several major outcome domains such as mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization, with an emphasis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As part of a regular series of meetings, the European Society of Cardiology recently met with European regulators and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry to review the current status of medical therapies for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Special attention has been paid to the debate on the relevant clinical endpoints in future AF trials and their implications for drug indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The need for large-scale major cardiovascular outcome and comparator studies for the approval of drugs designed to manage rhythm and/or control the rate has been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The requirements for appropriate ancillary studies, including quality of life and left ventricular function assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis, have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article reports the discussions that were held </plain></SENT>
