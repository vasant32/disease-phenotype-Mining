<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, we reported that sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), the pump responsible for reuptake of cytosolic calcium during diastole, plays a central role in the molecular mechanism of cardiac alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) is associated with impaired myocardial calcium handling, deficient SERCA2a, and increased susceptibility to cardiac alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that restoring deficient SERCA2a by gene transfer will significantly reduce arrhythmogenic cardiac alternans in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult guinea pigs were divided into 3 groups: control, HF, and HF+AAV9.SERCA2a gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HF resulted in a decrease in left ventricular fractional shortening compared with controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, isolated HF myocytes demonstrated slower sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, decreased Ca(2+) release, and increased diastolic Ca(2+) (P&lt;0.05) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SERCA2a, cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-calcium exchanger protein expression was decreased in HF compared with control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As predicted, HF increased susceptibility to cardiac alternans, as evidenced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp> thresholds for both V(m) alternans and Ca alternans compared with controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in vivo gene transfer of AAV9.SERCA2a in the failing heart improved left ventricular contractile function (P&lt;0.01), suppressed cardiac alternans (P&lt;0.01), and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2 P(o) secondary to reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2-P(S2814) (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This ultimately resulted in a decreased incidence of inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that SERCA2a gene transfer in the failing heart not only improves contractile function but also directly restores electric stability through the amelioration of key arrhythmogenic substrate (ie, cardiac alternans) and triggers (ie, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak) </plain></SENT>
