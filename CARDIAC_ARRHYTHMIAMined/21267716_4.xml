<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotype is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular genetic basis of ARVC is partially known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in DSP (desmoplakin), JUP (plakoglobin), PKP2 (plakophilin 2), DSG2 (desmoglein 2), and DSC2 (desmocollin 2) are responsible for approximately half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TMEM43 and TGFB3, encoding transmembrane protein 43 and transforming growth factor Î²3, respectively, also have been associated with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathogenesis of ARVC has at least two components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first component is fibroadiposis, which is the characteristics hallmark of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second is cardiac dysfunction, which is primarily due to impaired myocyte-to-myocyte attachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of fibroadiposis involves partial nuclear translocation of plakoglobin (PG) and subsequent suppression of canonical Wnt signaling, which is involved in the development of the right ventricle and its outflow tract, the predominant sites of involvement in ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suppression of the canonical Wnt signaling results in a switch to adipogenesis in the second heart field progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, ARVC is a disease of cardiac progenitor cells that have gone awry and differentiated to adipocytes </plain></SENT>
