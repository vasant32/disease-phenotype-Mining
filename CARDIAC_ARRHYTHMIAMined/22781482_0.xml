<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients presenting with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, repeat procedures are often performed, resulting in more extensive regions of conduction block and the potential for regions of dissociated atrial rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present case describes a patient post-multiple ablation procedures who presented with a symptomatic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the mechanism of which was hidden by the presence of extensive atrial dissociation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic study revealed the appropriate mechanism and a beneficial ablative procedure was then successfully accomplished </plain></SENT>
