<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the cardiac screening outcomes in a population of relatives of SADS victimsMETHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective and retrospective cohort study of consecutive families attending the Family Heart Screening clinic at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, from January 2007 to September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family members of SADS victims underwent a standard screening protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjunct clinical and postmortem information was sought on the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Families who had an existing diagnosis, or where the proband had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 115 families identified, 73 were found to fit inclusion criteria and were retained for analysis, with data available on 262 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over half of the screened family members were female, and the mean age was 38.6 years (standard deviation 15.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 22 of 73 families (30%), and 36 of 262 family members (13.7%), a potentially inheritable cause of SADS was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the population screened, 32 patients (12.2%) were treated with medication, and 5 (1.9%) have received implantable cardiac defibrillators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the five families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) who had a pathogenic gene mutation identified, three carried two such mutations.CONCLUSION: In keeping with international estimates, 30% of families of SADS victims were found to have a potentially inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common positive finding was LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advances in postmortem standards and genetic studies may assist in achieving more diagnoses in these families </plain></SENT>
