<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed cardiovascular structural and functional measurements (intima-media thickness, pulse pressure, pulse wave velocity, left atrial dimension (LAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, deceleration time of transmitral early diastolic flow and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)), by ultrasonography, blood pressure monitor, electrocardiography and applanation tonometry, as well as conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (age, body mass index, smoke, total to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol ratio, and plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), and investigated their associations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in men and women, separately, in 331 consecutive patients (87Â±7years, 74.0% female) with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> from the geriatric departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 378days, 110 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the full adjusted models, we found that increased LAD (hazard ratio [HR]=2.24 per 1-standard deviation [SD]; 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.23-4.09), reduced LVEF (HR=0.60 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 0.38-0.96), and increased total-to-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio (HR=1.99 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 1.05-3.78) were significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in men, whereas the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (HR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.28-4.78), increased plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (HR=1.32 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 1.06-1.64) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006086'>decreased body mass index</z:mp> (HR=0.60 per 1-SD; 95% CI: 0.44-0.83) could significantly predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Even in the last stage of lifespan, risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> still differ significantly in men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
