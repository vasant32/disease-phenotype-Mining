<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of both genetic background and clinical manifestations remains largely uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and especially the triggering factors of familial AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Probands were screened from 84 consecutive lone AF patients seen in our tertiary hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those confirmed to have at least 1 first-degree relative with lone AF were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>12-lead ECG, Holter recording, and cardiac ultrasound were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and other medical history were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether 17 kindreds with 59 AF patients, 52 of whom had lone AF, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initiation of AF was atrial extrasystolia (PACs) related in 35%, and vagal or sympathetic in 30% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within any given family, the characteristics related to AF initiation were the same in two-thirds of kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AV conduction abnormalities were found in 2 families, sinus node dysfunction in 2 families, and both in 3 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Frequent premature ventricular complexes (&gt;1,000/24 hours) were observed in 9 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional comorbidities included dilative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in 3 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In familial AF the proportion of PACs-related AF is lower than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> triggers for lone AF in general are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> but often family specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Concomitant rhythm disorders, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, are common in patients with familial AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A positive family history for AF in an apparently lone AF patient may be a marker for wider spectrum of cardiac pathology </plain></SENT>
