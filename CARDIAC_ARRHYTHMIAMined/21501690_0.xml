<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was: (1) to characterize and assess the incidence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in totally naive Beagle dogs (n=51; 10 males+41 females): (2) to study the effects of permanent ECG- and LVP-probe telemetry implants both acutely and up to 233days after surgery in a subset of 11 female Beagle dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Naive ECG assessments were conducted by means of 6 external telemetry leads in jacketed dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telemetry ECG recordings were captured by means of implanted telemetry devices suitable for ECG, LVP and aortic blood pressure recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experienced laboratory personnel visually evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 22h ECG recordings at different time points after implantation and evaluated the incidence and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 51 healthy and totally naive Beagle dogs showed a prevalence of: 49.0% 2Â°AVB; 58.8% single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature complexes</z:e>; 17.6% junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>; 27.5% ventricular complexes; 13.7% ventricular escape complexes; 21.6% ventricular premature complexes; 3.9% runs of ventricular complexes; 3.9% runs of ventricular escape complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As such, a high percentage of clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Beagle dogs showed different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> when ECG's obtained by external telemetry leads were fully evaluated for a 22h period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> implantation of a ventricular probe through the apex of the heart in 11 dogs only, resulted in higher incidences and frequencies of ventricular episodes, which (in some dogs) extended up to 8weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight months after surgery none of the implanted dogs showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and only 10% had single ventricular or ventricular premature complexes at low frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: A thorough evaluation of the ECG's of Beagle dogs selected for telemetry implantation can help to avoid inherent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-burdened dogs being implanted and used in studies where these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> will confound drug assessment by increasing the number of potential false positives </plain></SENT>
