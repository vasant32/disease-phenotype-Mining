<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RSA is thus considered to reflect the capacity for flexible and regulated affective reactivity and a general propensity for psychopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, studies assessing RSA reactivity to emotional challenges tend to report more consistent associations with internalizing than with externalizing disorders, although it is unclear whether this is a function of the type of emotion challenges used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined whether baseline RSA was associated with internalizing and/or externalizing severity in a sample of 273 young children (ages 5-6) with elevated symptoms of psychopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following motivation-based models of emotion, we also tested whether RSA reactivity during withdrawal-based (fear, sadness) and approach-based (happiness, anger) emotion inductions was differentially associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline RSA was not associated with externalizing or internalizing symptom severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, RSA reactivity to specific emotional challenges was associated differentially with each symptom domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As expected, internalizing symptom severity was associated with greater RSA withdrawal (increased arousal) during fearful and sad film segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, externalizing symptom severity was related to blunted RSA withdrawal during a happy film segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of theoretically derived stimuli may be important in characterizing the nature of the deficits in emotion processing that differentiate the internalizing and externalizing domains of psychopathology </plain></SENT>
