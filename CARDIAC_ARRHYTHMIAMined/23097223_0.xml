<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aim is to describe long-term routine in-hospital FU, evaluate compliance to guidelines, and assess the portion of visits-with-an-action (VWA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicentre prospective FOLLOWPACE study collected data in the period 2003-2010, regarding FU of 1517 patients with a first PM for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> indications in 23 Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 472 visits were analysed with a median FU of 4.9 years, adding up to 6750 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time to the first three visits was 35, 127, and 303 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter the median interval between visits was 180 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients had 2 FU/year, 22% had 1 FU/year, and 18% had &gt;3 FU/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of patients with single-chamber PMs had at least 1 FU/year, whereas 36% of patients with dual-chamber PMs received at least 2 FU/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first year, 52% of visits were VWA, as opposed to 17% after 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Battery status was assessed in 98%, and stimulation and sensing thresholds in 90% and 77% of visits, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming markedly declined from â‰ˆ 60% in the first FU visit to 10-20% after the fifth visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the measurements during PM FU are according to guidelines, the frequency of FU is not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the vast majority of performed FU, PM programming is left unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a large portion of FU visits is redundant, such that their frequency after the first year can be diminished, or replaced by remote FU </plain></SENT>
