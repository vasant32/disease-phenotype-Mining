<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study investigated the relationship between the ostia of the coronary sinus (CS) and the tricuspid annulus (TA) for CS cannulation using a right ventricular (RV) lead, which could map out the TA by forming a curve when placed at the apex or low septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients (45 males, 67 ± 12 years) who were admitted for CRT device implant were included in the evaluation of the relationship between the CS ostia and TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An electrophysiological (EP) mapping catheter was used to probe the CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ostium was shown by the CS venography at the left anterior oblique (LAO) 20° and caudal 20° </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local electrograms were collected with CS catheters in the CS or RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was evaluated before each procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CS ostia were located within 3.75 cm around the tip of TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two subjects (Group I, 89%) had CS ostia located under the TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (Group II) with CS ostia over the TA revealed larger left ventricular (LV) size and a smaller ratio of left atrium (LA)/LV size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LV enlargement predicted the presence of CS ostia over the TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Typical CS electrograms were used to further confirm if the EP catheter was in the CS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of the RV lead revealed that the CS ostia had a close relationship with the TA </plain></SENT>
