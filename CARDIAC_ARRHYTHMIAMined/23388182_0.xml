<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on data on reimbursed procedures and drugs, we assessed AF recurrence using different models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Costs related to the index hospitalization were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the observation period, 830 patients underwent a first catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-year follow-up data were available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with an average follow-up of 30.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent of patients were treated for paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of AF was defined as the occurrence of one of the following events: a repeat catheter ablation, an electric cardioversion or an antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) prescription, the latter two taking into account a blanking period of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurred in 59.8% of patients after 1 year and in 65.9% of them after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If AAD prescription was considered as an indicator for ablation failure only if it occurred after a 1 month AAD-free period, recurrence of AF occurred in 37.3% of patients after 1 year and in 49.9% after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on the prescription of rate and rhythm control drugs before the ablation, we conclude that up to 15.8% of patients underwent catheter ablation as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation of AF in Belgium on average costs about â‚¬9600 for the initial intervention.CONCLUSION: Since the effectiveness of catheter ablation of AF appears to be less favourable in real-world practice as compared with results reported in clinical trials, and given the high initial cost of the procedure, we suggest to strictly limiting the intervention to patients in whom it is currently believed to be most beneficial, i.e. those with severely symptomatic and drug-refractory paroxysmal AF with no or minimal structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
