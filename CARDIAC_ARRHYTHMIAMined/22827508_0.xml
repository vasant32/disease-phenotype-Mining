<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 7 clinically healthy sportsmen (soccer players, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> men; 15-17 years old), during a 30-min velo ergometer stress test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) loop recorder (Vitaphone BT 3300; Vitasystems GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used in automatic mode, using special LRMA software (MDT, Lázně Bohdaneč, Czech Republic) and a Nokia (Espoo, Finland) model 6730 Symbian phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Automatically recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> events were transmitted from the loop recorder by Bluetooth(®) (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., Kirkland, WA) to a phone and then by 3G (through our partner mobile operator, MagtiCom Ltd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[Tbilsi, Georgia]) to the Vitasystems server in Germany and were available to Georgian physicians via e-mail/Internet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded/monitored during 7-68 h of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of automatically recorded ECG events varied between 3 and 170 per observation, or 0.4-10.7 hourly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases of sinus brady- and tachyarrhythmia, sinus node <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, supraventricular premature complexes, and ventricular premature complexes were correctly recognized by automatic recognition software and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients and 1 sportsman previously unspecified (despite multiple investigations), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006688'>paroxysmal tachycardia</z:hpo> (n=1), sinus node <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> syndrome (n=1), and ventricular premature complexes (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women) light <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and nervousness were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurosis</z:e> (both elderly men, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>) we had to stop investigation prematurely because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mobile telecardiology represents feasible methodology to monitor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in outpatients in Georgia, promoting earlier discharge of non-life-threatening cases, improving patients' comfort of life, and increasing their mobility with enhanced safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mobile telehealth might also represent significant cost-saving for insurance companies (this is an ongoing study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, in remote areas mobile telemonitoring of patients will improve quality of care by timely provision of a second opinion in cases when local expertise is not sufficient </plain></SENT>
