<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With current genetic technology, it is possible to detect mutations associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS), a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, prospective parents diagnosed with LQTS will have to decide whether or not to prevent its transmission to future generations, either by not procreating or through the use of assisted reproductive technologies or prenatal testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper explores how a hereditary predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> can influence reproductive decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study draws from interviews and focus groups with individuals who have personal or family histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A keyword search was conducted on interview transcripts to identify quotes for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants expressed complex, often ambivalent attitudes about the prospect of having a child with a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their comments reveal conflicting understandings of genetic responsibility and reflect the variable effects of personal experience on reproductive decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This paper compares attitudes towards LQTS and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> in analyzing the themes that emerged in interviews and focus groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The "disability critique" of prenatal testing should be applied carefully to a context of genetic predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in order to understand reproductive decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Firsthand experience with the condition, among other factors, can weigh heavily in those decisions </plain></SENT>
