<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was induced with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> 70 mg, fentanyl 0.75 mg and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8884">rocuronium</z:chebi> 40 mg and maintained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> 0.8-2.0% in oxygen 2 l x min(-1) and nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> 2 l x min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Just before the end of surgery, ST elevation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> on the ECG was observed for only a few seconds, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (Vf) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 50 mg, <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> 0.5 mg and methoxamine 6 mg were administered intravenously, and sinus rhythm and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure returned from Vf within one minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case achieved a complete response to quick administration of the coronary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> and antiarrhythmic agent, in this case whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> was suspected on the basis of ST elevation in the first place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have to be careful of various initiating factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> each time during anesthesia as it is difficult to assess its clinical risk, especially in prone position because actual coronary flow is much lower and cardiac resuscitation is difficult in a sudden cardiac complication </plain></SENT>
