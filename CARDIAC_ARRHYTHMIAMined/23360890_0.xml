<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> and other selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors on corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, in a large and diverse clinical population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cross sectional study using electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records to explore the relation between antidepressant dose and QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">Methadone</z:chebi>, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centres and outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded after prescription of antidepressant or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> between February 1990 and August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relation between antidepressant dose and QTc interval in linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For a subset of patients, change in QTc after drug dose was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-response association with QTc prolongation was identified for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> (adjusted beta 0.10 (SE 0.04), P&lt;0.01), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> (adjusted beta 0.58 (0.15), P&lt;0.001), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> (adjusted beta 0.11 (0.03), P&lt;0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association with QTc shortening was identified for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> (adjusted beta 0.02 (0.01) P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within-subject paired observations supported the QTc prolonging effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> (10 mg to 20 mg, mean QTc increase 7.8 (SE 3.6) ms, adjusted P&lt;0.05; and 20 mg to 40 mg, mean QTc increase 10.3 (4.0) ms, adjusted P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a modest prolongation of QT interval with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, and identified additional antidepressants with similar observed risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacovigilance studies using electronic health record data may be a useful method of identifying potential risk associated with treatments </plain></SENT>
