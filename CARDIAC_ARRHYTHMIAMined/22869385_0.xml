<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Ablation of anteroseptal accessory pathways have historically been associated with lower success rates and a higher risk of AV nodal injury due to close proximity to the compact AV node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the technique of ablation of anteroseptal APs via the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing EP study and ablation at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore from 2008 to 2011 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and/or WPW was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients less than 21 years of age who underwent ablation from the RIJV for either WPW or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340507" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">concealed accessory pathway</z:e> located in the anteroseptal region were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 16 patients met inclusion criteria and were the subject of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had WPW (75%) and four had a concealed AP (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation was acutely successful in 94% of patients (15/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, ablation was deferred due to close proximity to the compact AV node and risk of AV nodal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency (RF) was used in 14 patients and cryoenergy in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in WB CL pre- and post-ablation (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no complications encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 15 ± 12 months, there were no recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablation of APs in the right anteroseptal region can safely and effectively be performed via the RIJV with a success rate of 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This technique should be considered for ablation of APs located in the anterior septum </plain></SENT>
