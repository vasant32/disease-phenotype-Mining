<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of continuous catheter impedance monitoring prior to ablation to facilitate differentiation of the coronary sinus ostium (<z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>) and the middle cardiac vein (MCV) from the right atrial posteroseptal region (RPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Empiric observations have suggested that continuous catheter impedance monitoring could differentiate the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> and MCV from the RPS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation in the MCV or coronary sinus has been associated with coronary artery injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of these areas may be difficult with either fluoroscopy or electrogram characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Continuous impedance measurements using a 4-mm Navistar (Biosense Webster) ablation catheter were conducted in 17 consecutive patients undergoing ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average impedance value was recorded at the right atrial septum (RS) posterior to the bundle of His, the RPS region, within 1 cm inside the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> and in the MCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These areas were confirmed and demarcated with 3-D mapping and biplane fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in impedance was observed between the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> (X = 146.6 ± 24.8) and RPS [Formula: see text] regions (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a significant rise in impedance was seen between the MCV [Formula: see text] and RPS and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi>, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant change in impedance was found between the RS [Formula: see text] and RPS regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous impedance measurements during mapping can facilitate differentiation of catheter locations inside the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="48272">CSO</z:chebi> and MCV from extracoronary sinus regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may reduce the risk of inadvertent coronary artery damage during the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
