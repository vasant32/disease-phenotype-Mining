<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine if there is a difference between autonomic cardiac control as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) compared to a healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The RA group (45) and control group (39) were matched for age and body mass index (BMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three techniques were used: time domain, frequency domain and Poincarè plot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> possible confounding factors were excluded and the test environment strictly regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal heart rate was significantly higher in the RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the supine position significant differences existed between RA patients and controls (P ≤ 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indicators of parasympathetic activity showed significantly lower variation in the RA group (root mean square of the standard deviation [RMSSD] = 14.70, percentage of successive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interval differences larger than 50 ms [pNN50] = 0.50, standard deviation [SD]1 = 10.50, high frequency <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi> (ms(2)) = 31) compared to controls (RMSSD = 29.40, pNN50 = 7.8, SD1 = 20.9, HF (ms(2)) = 141.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indicators of sympathetic variation were also significantly lower in RA patients (SD2 = 36.70, low frequency [LF] (ms(2)) = 65) compared to controls (SD2 = 49.50, LF (ms(2)) = 175) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the standing position eight variables indicated autonomic impairment by significant differences (P ≤ 0.01) between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response of the RA group to an orthostatic stressor showed less vagal withdrawal, (P-values for RMSSD = 0.038, pNN50 = 0.022, SD1 = 0.043 and HF [ms(2) ] = 0.008 respectively); and lower sympathetic response (P-values for SD2 = 0.001 and LF [ms(2) ] &lt; 0.001) when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An inability of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to efficiently compensate for internal and external environmental changes may predispose RA patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, thereby increasing cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three methods used showed the same outcome, implying decreased HRV and thus an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluating the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system might be critical in planning management of RA patients </plain></SENT>
