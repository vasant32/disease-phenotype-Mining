<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variation (SVV) and pleth variability index (PVI) can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients during major surgical procedures in Hans Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study consisted of fifty-five Hans Chinese patients undergoing resection of primary retroperitoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (PRPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the surgical procedures, hemodynamic data [central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index (SVI), SVV, and PVI] were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE) (8 ml•kg-1 of 6% hydroxyethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> 130/0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in SVI ≥ 10% after VE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were excluded from analysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> during VE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline SVV correlated well with baseline PVI and the changes in SVV was correlated with the changes in PVI (p &lt; 0.01) after VE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant increases of CI, SVI and decreases of SVV, PVI in responder (Rs) after VE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROC results showed that the areas for SVV, PVI were significantly higher than the areas for CI, MAP, CVP, PI (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best threshold values to predict fluid responsiveness were more than 12.5% for SVV and more than 13.5% for PVI in the real surgical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The baseline value of SVV, and PVI correlated significantly with volume-induced changes in SVI (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both SVV and PVI could be used to predict intraoperative fluid responsiveness during resection of PRPT in Hans Chinese </plain></SENT>
