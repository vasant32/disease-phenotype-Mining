<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, the mechanisms responsible for enhanced DOR and tachyarrhythmias remain largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) transients and APs were measured optically from Langendorff rabbit hearts at high (150 × 150 μm(2)) or low (1.5 × 1.5 cm(2)) magnification while pacing at a physiological (120 beats/min) or a slow heart rate (SHR = 50 beats/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blots and pharmacological interventions were used to elucidate the regional effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (SHR 50 beats/min) increased APDs gradually (time constant τf→s = 48 ± 9.2 s) and caused a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary Ca</z:e>(2+) release (SCR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during AP plateaus, occurring at the base on average of 184.4 ± 9.7 ms after the Ca(2+) transient upstroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In subcellular imaging, SCRs were temporally synchronous and spatially homogeneous within myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diastole, SHR elicited variable asynchronous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events leading to subcellular Ca(2+) waves, detectable only at high magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCR was regionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, correlated with APD prolongation (P &lt; 0.01, n = 5), enhanced DOR (r = 0.9277 ± 0.03, n = 7), and was gradually reversed by pacing at 120 beats/min along with APD shortening (P &lt; 0.05, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A stabilizer of leaky <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors (RyR2), 3-(4-benzylcyclohexyl)-1-(7-<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32772">methoxy</z:chebi>-2,3-dihydrobenzo[f][1,4]thiazepin-4(5H)-yl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32879">propan</z:chebi>-1-one (K201; 1 μM), suppressed SCR and reduced APD at the base, thereby reducing DOR (P &lt; 0.02, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ventricular ectopy induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (n = 5/15) was suppressed by K201 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed spatial differences of voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel protein (Cav1.2α), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchange (NCX1), voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel (Nav1.5), and rabbit <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related (rERG) protein [but not RyR2 or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2a] that correlate with the SCR distribution and explain the molecular basis for SCR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> elicits synchronized subcellular SCRs of sufficient magnitude to overcome the source-sink mismatch and to promote afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
