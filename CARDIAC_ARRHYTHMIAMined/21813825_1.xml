<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic measures of heart structure and function have been reported to predict adverse CV outcomes in various pathologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to assess whether echocardiographic parameters are independently associated with increased CV events in patients with CKD Stages 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We consecutively enrolled 505 CKD patients from our outpatient department of internal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CV events were defined as CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, hospitalization for unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> attack and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative CV events' risk was analyzed by Cox regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, old age, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>; decreased serum albumin and hematocrit levels; left atrial diameter (LAD) &gt;4.7 cm [hazard ratio (HR), 2.141; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.155-3.971, P = 0.016]; increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (HR, 1.006; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.010, P = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;55% (HR, 2.007; 95% CI, 1.007-3.743, P = 0.028) were independently associated with increased CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that LAD &gt;4.7 cm, increased LVMI and LVEF &lt;55% are independently associated with adverse CV outcomes in CKD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screening CKD patients by means of echocardiography may help identify a high-risk group of poor CV prognosis </plain></SENT>
