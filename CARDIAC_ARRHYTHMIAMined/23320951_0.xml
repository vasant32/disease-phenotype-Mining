<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, currently no known blockers of Kir2.x channels exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Kir1.1b, predominantly expressed in the kidney, is potently blocked by an oxidation-resistant mutant of the honey bee toxin tertiapin (tertiapin-Q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using various computational tools, we show that both channels are closed by a hydrophobic gating mechanism and inward rectification occurs in the absence of divalent cations and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then demonstrate that tertiapin-Q binds to the external vestibule of Kir1.1b and Kir2.1 with K(d) values of 11.6 nM and 131 Î¼M, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that a single mutation of tertiapin-Q increases the binding affinity for Kir2.1 by 5 orders of magnitude (K(d) = 0.7 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This potent blocker of Kir2.1 may serve as a structural template from which potent compounds for the treatment of various diseases mediated by this channel subfamily, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, can be developed </plain></SENT>
