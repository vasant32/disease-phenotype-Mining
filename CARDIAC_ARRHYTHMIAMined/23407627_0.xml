<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this retrospective, bi-centre study were to analyse the rate and nature of device-related complications requiring surgical revision in a large series of patients undergoing device implantation, elective generator replacement and pacing system upgrade and to systematically assess the impact of such complications on patient outcome and healthcare utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 2671 consecutive procedures (1511 device implantations, 1034 elective generator replacements, and 126 pacing system upgrades) performed between January 2006 and March 2011 were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures recorded were complication-related mortality, number of re-operations, need for complex surgical procedures, number of re-hospitalizations, and additional hospital treatment days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up of 27 months, the overall rate of complications was 2.8% per procedure-year [9.5% in cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) device implantation, 6.1% in pacing system upgrade, 3.5% in implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, 1.7% in pacemaker implantation, and 1.7% in generator replacement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure with the highest risk of complications was CRT device implantation (odds ratio: 6.6; P &lt; 0.001); these complications primarily involved coronary sinus lead dislodgement and device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with complications had a significantly higher number of device-related hospitalizations (2.3 ± 0.6 vs. 1.0 ± 0.1; P &lt; 0.001) and hospital treatment days (15.7 ± 25.1 vs. 3.6 ± 1.1; P &lt; 0.001) than those without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the complication with the greatest negative impact on patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy implantation was the procedure with the highest risk of complications requiring surgical revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were associated with substantial clinical consequences and a significant increase in the number and length of hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
