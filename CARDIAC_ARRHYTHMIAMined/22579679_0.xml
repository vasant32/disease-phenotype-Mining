<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Work in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has shown improved defibrillation success using low tilt waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that a novel low tilt biphasic waveform will be non-inferior to a standard tilt waveform whilst delivering lower energy for the defibrillation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> who experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> received shocks from a novel low tilt waveform defibrillator at 120J or a standard tilt waveform defibrillator at 150J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resuscitation guidelines were followed as per Resuscitation Council UK, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A shock was successful when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was terminated for â‰¥ 5s following shock delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 113 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The low tilt device was used for 56 cases and the standard tilt device for 57 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presenting rhythm was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) in 71.7% (81/113), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EMD">pulseless electrical activity</z:e> (PEA) in 15.9% (18/113), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in 9.7% (11/113), <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> in 1.8% (2/113) and narrow complex rhythm in 0.9% (1/113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low tilt device resulted in first shock success in 86% (48/56 cases) vs. the standard tilt device first shock success of 77% (44/57 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in first shock success between the two devices (p=0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low tilt waveform used in this study demonstrated first shock success rates in keeping with a commercially available high tilt defibrillator which could result in less myocardial damage due to reduced energy requirements </plain></SENT>
