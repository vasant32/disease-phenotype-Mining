<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional differences between intrinsic nerve stimulation and adrenergic receptor activation remain incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the functional differences between efferent cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation and direct adrenergic receptor activation in porcine ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Female Yorkshire pigs (n = 13) underwent surgical exposure of the heart and stellate ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 56-electrode sock was placed over the ventricles to record epicardial electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent bilateral sympathetic stimulation (BSS) (n = 8) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) administration (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activation recovery intervals (ARIs) were measured at each electrode before and during BSS or NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of ARI shortening during BSS or NE administration was used as a measure of functional nerve or adrenergic receptor density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During BSS, ARI shortening was nonuniform across the epicardium (F value 9.62, P = 0.003), with ARI shortening greatest in the mid-basal lateral right ventricle and least in the midposterior left ventricle (LV) (mean normalized values: 0.9 ± 0.08 vs. 0.56 ± 0.08; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NE administration resulted in greater ARI shortening in the LV apex than basal segments [0.91 ± 0.04 vs. 0.63 ± 0.05 (averaged basal segments); P = 0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dispersion of ARIs increased in 50% and 60% of the subjects undergoing BSS and NE, respectively, but decreased in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is nonuniform response to cardiac sympathetic activation of both porcine ventricles, which is not fully explained by adrenergic receptor density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Different pools of adrenergic receptors may mediate the cardiac electrophysiological effects of efferent sympathetic nerve activity and circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
