<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method includes the combined action of magnetic field pulses and series of electric impulses; magnetic and electric stimulation were performed synchronously - at first, on one brain hemisphere, then on another hemisphere with alternation frequency 9.5-10.5 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison group consisted of 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 1 who received physiotherapeutic treatment as a combination of transcranial magnetic therapy and electro-stimulation with simultaneous action on both brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment duration was 10 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy was assessed by the decrease in frequency and intensity of complaints, improvement of patient's health status measured (a scale for assessment of activity, health perception and mood) and improvement of the status of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (Vein's questionnaire), mental sphere (the Luscher color test) and cognitive traits (The Concentrated Attention Test of the Toulouse-Pierron Factorial Battery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The status of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was evaluated before and after the treatment using cardiointervalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain bioelectrical activity was assessed using encephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction of autonomic, psychoemotional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e>, normalization of brain bioelectrical activity due to the Î±-rhythm organization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> removal were identified in the main group after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects of this physiotherapeutic treatment was found </plain></SENT>
