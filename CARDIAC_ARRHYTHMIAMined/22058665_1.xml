<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a similar analysis of total <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-related risk in a subgroup with data about other <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake (11,679 study participants; 198 hospitalized).Results: With non-coffee-drinkers as the referent, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at the level of &lt;1 cup of coffee per day was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9-1.1; p = 0.7); for 1-3 cups/day, it was 0.9 (CI, 0.8-1.0; p = 0.2), and for â‰¥4 cups/day, it was 0.8 (CI, 0.7-0.9; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With coffee intake as a continuous variable, the HR per cup per day was 0.97 (CI, 0.95-0.99; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were similar for several strata, including persons with history or symptoms of possible cardiore-spiratory disease and those without such history or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coffee had similar relations to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (48% of participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) and most other specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controlled for number of cups of coffee per day, total <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake was inversely related to risk (HR highest quartile vs lowest = 0.6; p = 0.03).Conclusion: The inverse relations of coffee and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake to hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> make it unlikely that moderate <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> intake increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
