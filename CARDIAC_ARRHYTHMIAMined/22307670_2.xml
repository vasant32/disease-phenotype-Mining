<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism(s) for EAD genesis, especially regarding the relative contribution of Ca(2+) wave (CaW) vs. L-type Ca current (I(Ca,L)), still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we simultaneously recorded action potentials (APs) and intracellular Ca(2+) images in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes and systematically compared the properties of EADs in the following two pharmacological models: 1) <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>; 200 Î¼M); and 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (100 nM) and BayK 8644 (50 nM) (Iso + BayK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the rate dependency of EADs, the temporal relationship between EADs and corresponding CaWs, the distribution of EADs over voltage, and the effects of blockers of I(Ca,L), Na/Ca exchangers, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most convincing evidence came from the AP-clamp experiment, in which the cell membrane clamp was switched from current clamp to voltage clamp using a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AP waveform without EAD; CaWs disappeared in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> model, but persisted in the Iso + BayK model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We postulate that, although CaWs and reactivation of I(Ca,L) may act synergistically in either case, reactivation of I(Ca,L) plays a predominant role in EAD genesis under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> model), while spontaneous CaWs are a predominant cause for EADs under Ca(2+) overload condition (Iso + BayK model) </plain></SENT>
