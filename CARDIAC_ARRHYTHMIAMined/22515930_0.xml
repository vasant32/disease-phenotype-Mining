<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Left ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (LVHT) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> frequently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> (NMDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether differences exist between LVHT patients with and without NMDs remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the baseline characteristics and prognoses of LVHT patients with and without NMDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective, observational study included patients in whom LVHT was diagnosed at one echocardiographic laboratory between June 1995 and June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a baseline cardiologic examination, and were invited to participate in a neurological investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In June 2011, patients were contacted by telephone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two patients received a diagnosis of LVHT (53 female; mean age, 53 standard deviation [SD] Â± 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-three patients (72%) were investigated neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A specific NMD was diagnosed in 25, including metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (n = 16), Leber's hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (n = 3), myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (n = 3), Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0080040" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postpoliomyelitis syndrome</z:e> (n = 1), and Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An NMD of unknown etiology was diagnosed in 79 patients, and the neurological investigation produced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 64 months, the mortality amounted to 4.84%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline data did not differ between patients with and without NMDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred among patients without NMDs, even though their observation periods were much longer (8 vs. 4 years, P = .01) than those of patients who were not investigated neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence or absence of NMDs influences the prognosis of patients with LVHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients should be investigated by a neurologist when LVHT is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with LVHT and an NMD should be educated about the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They should be closely followed, and the implantation of cardiac electronic devices should be considered </plain></SENT>
