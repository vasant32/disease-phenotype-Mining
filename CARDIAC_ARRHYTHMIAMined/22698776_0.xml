<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Degenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic valve stenosis</z:hpo> (AS) is associated with conduction abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker implantation is encountered after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Not much is known about the pacemaker implantation rate during midterm follow-up after SAVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to determine the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) in the midterm after SAVR in a tertiary care facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed procedural data of 734 consecutive patients (56% men; mean age, 68.9±9.5 years) with degenerative severe AS who underwent SAVR between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative electrocardiograms were assessed for occurrence of conduction abnormalities, and we sought to determine the incidence and indication for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> with a median follow-up of 3.76 years (interquartile range, 2.44 to 5.59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied to identify predictors for early (≤30 days) and late (&gt;30 days) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isolated SAVR was performed in 56%, SAVR with coronary artery bypass grafting in 35%, and SAVR with any other valve therapy in 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) was present in 7% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011705'>first-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBBs</z:chebi> were detected in 63 patients (8.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (2.0%) required a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> within 30 days after SAVR, and 28 (4.0%) underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> more than 30 days after SAVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The linearized rate of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after SAVR was 1.01%±0.37% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> at baseline had a higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> incidence after SAVR than patients without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, both within 30 days (8% vs 1.5%, p=0.001) and after 30 days (10% vs 2.9%, p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> incidence after 30 days was also significantly higher in patients with a new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> after SAVR (7.8% vs 2.9%, p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By multivariate logistic regression analysis, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and the combination of AS and regurgitation predicted <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> within 30 days after SAVR (hazard ratio [HR], 470; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 14.27; and HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.03 to 1.73, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> (HR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.41 to 7.54), previous cardiac operation (HR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.16 to 9.94), and severe left ventricular dysfunction (HR, 9.82; 95% CI, 2.90 to 33.26) were predictors for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after 30 days post-SAVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe AS who underwent SAVR have a persistent 1% annual risk for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postoperative presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> predicted the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> both within 30 days and after 30 days after SAVR </plain></SENT>
