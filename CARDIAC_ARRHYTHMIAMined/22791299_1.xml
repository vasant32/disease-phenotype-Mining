<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AF increases with age as does the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 75 years the risk from age alone is so high that current guidelines recommend anticoagulation even in the absence of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is often asymptomatic and only discovered by chance or when a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> already has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have launched a major screening study for silent AF in which 25,000 Swedes aged 75 and 76 years are randomized to either participate in a screening programme using ambulant intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) recording to detect silent AF, or act as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom AF is detected are offered cardiological examination and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment according to current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cohort and the controls will be followed prospectively for 5 years after the inclusion of the first participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An interim analysis will be made after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that screening for AF will reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence in the screened population, and that this screening will prove to be cost effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints are: any thromboembolic event, <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, other major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, first ever diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, and a composite of these endpoints </plain></SENT>
