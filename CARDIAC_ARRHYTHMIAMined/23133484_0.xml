<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> patients who had undergone surgical correction at the Kyungpook National University Hospital from January 2000 to December 2010, were retrospectively evaluated for patient characteristics, clinical manifestation, preoperative management, intraoperative findings, postoperative progress, and follow-up status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (17 boys and 11 girls, mean age=10.6Â±21.5 days) were included and were categorized as follows: group I, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> with intact ventricular septum (n=13); group II, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp>, n=12); and group III, <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>/<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I underwent the most intensive preoperative management (balloon atrial septostomy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi> medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group II showed the highest incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Usual and unusual coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> patterns were observed in 20 (71%) and 8 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial and half-turned truncal switch operations were performed in 25 and 3 patients (Group III), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (8 patients), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system complications (3 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (1 patient), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (3 patients), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> (1 patient), and no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group II showed the mildest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> on follow-up echocardiograms (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent reoperation, and 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed favorable results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups and no significant difference in postoperative complication, reoperation, and mortality among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, our results were inadequate to evaluate the risk factors for reoperation and mortality owing to the small number of patients and short follow-up duration </plain></SENT>
