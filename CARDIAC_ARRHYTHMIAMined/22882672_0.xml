<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> account for one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sudden natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the young (1-35 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hitherto, the prevalence of genopositive cases has primarily been based on deceased persons referred for postmortem genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> potentially may represent the worst of cases, thus possibly overestimating the prevalence of potentially disease causing mutations in the 3 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) genes in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore wanted to investigate the prevalence of mutations in an unselected population of sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in a nationwide setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA for genetic testing was available for 44 cases of sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in Denmark in the period 2000-2006 (equaling 33% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the age group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A were sequenced and in vitro electrophysiological studies were performed on novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 5 of 44 cases (11%) carried a mutation in 1 of the 3 genes corresponding to 11% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated cases (R190W KCNQ1, F29L KCNH2 (2 cases), P297S KCNH2 and P1177L SCN5A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P1177L SCN5A has not been reported before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro electrophysiological studies of P1177L SCN5A revealed an increased sustained current suggesting a LQTS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a nationwide setting, the genetic investigation of an unselected population of sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> cases aged 1-35 years finds a lower than expected number of mutations compared to referred populations previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the prevalence of mutations in the 3 major LQTS associated genes may not be as abundant as previously estimated </plain></SENT>
