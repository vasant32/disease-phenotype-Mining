<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The origin and mechanisms of focal and macro-re-entrant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> occurring after ablation of paroxysmal or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> are difficult to determine and are often the cause of distress for both patients and electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe a novel practical approach which would be helpful in planning the treatment of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in patients who had received prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used an algorithm which aims to facilitate mapping and ablation strategies, using both conventional electrophysiological tools and a three-dimensional electroanatomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated a series of 40 patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> who had undergone a prior ablation procedure for paroxysmal or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with a step-wise approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach consisted of four steps: the use of a decapolar catheter to assess the coronary sinus and an entrainment map to evaluate the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the CTI was not involved, we used a 20-pole dual-loop circular mapping catheter, AFocusII DL, to map the left atrium chamber rapidly during the rhythm of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified the target entrainment at the putative channels and performed catheter ablation at the critical isthmus of these macrocircuits until the restoration of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-five atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> were identified in 40 consecutive patients (1.9 ± 1.6 per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 48, the mechanism was macro-re-entry, and the remaining 27 were focal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 18 months of follow-up, the treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurred in only three patients, whereas in another four patients, a different atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 33 patients maintained sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased acquisition speed by AFocusII DL facilitated the reconstruction of the geometric chamber, and the generation of an isochronal activation map reduced processing time and fluoroscopy time per patient, together with the radiation exposure and patient radiation dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A novel algorithm combining both conventional electrophysiology and a three-dimensional electroanatomic approach for rapid diagnosis, accurate mapping and ablation of iatrogenic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> showed high reproducibility and a satisfactory overall success rate </plain></SENT>
