<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA) has been pointed as one of the etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of VA and to investigate the factors associated with their occurrence in incident kidney transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 100 incident kidney transplant recipients were included in the study (39.7 ± 10.1 years, 55% male, 43.6 ± 10.1 days of transplantation, 66% living donors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent 24 h electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and multi-slice computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the patients had VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was observed in 57% of the patients while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was found in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>Coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> (CAC) was observed in 26 patients, from which 31% had severe calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with VA was predominantly male, had been on dialysis therapy for a longer time and had more coronary calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multiple logistic regression analysis, male gender and CAC score were independently associated with the presence of VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, kidney transplant recipients exhibited a high prevalence of VA and the factors associated with its occurrence were the male gender and the presence of CAC </plain></SENT>
