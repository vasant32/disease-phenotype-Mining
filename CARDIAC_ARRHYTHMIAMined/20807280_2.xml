<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the substrate and role of catheter ablation for VT in apical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with apical HCM and frequent, drug refractory VT (mean age of 46 ± 10 years, left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction; 54 ± 14%) underwent catheter ablation with the use of electroanatomic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endocardial mapping was performed in 4 patients and 3 patients underwent epicardial mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 3 patients, VT was related to areas of scar in the apical LV where maximal apical wall thickness ranged from 14.5 to 17.8 mm, and 2 patients had apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endocardial and epicardial substrate mapping revealed low voltage (&lt;1.5 mV) scar in both endocardial and epicardial LV in 2 and only in the epicardium in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inducible VT was abolished with a combination of endocardial and epicardial ablation in 2 patients, but was ineffective in the third patient who had intramural reentry that required transcoronary <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> ablation of an obtuse marginal vessel for abolition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient had focal nonsustained repetitive VT from right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), consistent with idiopathic RVOT-VT, that was successfully ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-ups of 3-9 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remained free from VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Monomorphic VT in apical HCM can be due to endocardial, epicardial or intramural reentry in areas of apical scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epicardial ablation or transcoronary alcohol ablation is required in some cases </plain></SENT>
