<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ozone oxidative preconditioning in several pathologies characterized by cellular oxidative and inflammatory burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of oxidative preconditioning in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned into five groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups 1 and 2 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and I/R groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the other groups received two different doses of ozone therapies by rectal insufflations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The last group received vehicle (oxygen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected to myocardial I/R (40 min/10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded during I/R progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of reperfusion, plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity and total nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NO(x)) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were estimated in the heart left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was also performed to visualize the protective cellular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both doses of ozone therapy were equally protective in reducing CK-MB release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the higher dose was more effective in reducing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation, elevated MPO activity and plasma NO(x) as well as preserving myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Histological examination also revealed better improvement with a higher dose of ozone therapy compared to the I/R group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ozone therapy can afford significant cardioprotection against biochemical and histological changes associated with I/R injury </plain></SENT>
