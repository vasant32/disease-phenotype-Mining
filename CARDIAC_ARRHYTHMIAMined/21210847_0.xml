<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> influence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> on the cardiac repolarization and the drug sensitivity of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel to sotalol was comparatively studied in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts at pharmacological concentrations through recording of epicardial monophasic action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (1-30 μm) concentration-dependently prolonged the monophasic action potential durations (MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) ) (P &lt; 0.05); while the effects of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> on MAPD were biphasic: it prolonged MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) at lower concentrations (1-3 μm) but shortened MAPD(30) and MAPD(90) at higher concentrations (10-30 μm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sotalol-induced prolongation of MAPD(90) was significantly less in the hearts pretreated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> than those treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the pro-arrhythmic events induced by sotalol in the hearts pretreated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> was also significantly lower than those pretreated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> have different modulating effects on cardiac repolarization: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> can concentration-dependently prolong the cardiac repolarization time and thus may reduce the repolarization reserve and increase the susceptibility of female rabbits to sotalol-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, whereas <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> may shorten the cardiac repolarization time at concentrations above 10 μm, thus protecting the heart from drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
