<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Survey of 209 health-care professionals providing specialized treatment and care of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients at the five implanting centres in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questions pertained to gender, age, years of experience within the field, knowledge of the ongoing critical debate on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, and personal experience with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment, and/or sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> within family and/or friends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, 185 (88.5%) completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physicians spent less time informing patients about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment prior to implantation (mean min = 17.7 ± 11.2 vs. 28.6 ± 19.4; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to discuss clinical issues but less likely to discuss psychosocial issues with patients compared with non-physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physicians were less likely to believe that their personal attitude towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment has no influence on how they deal professionally with patients (27.8 vs. 43.6%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians and non-physicians were equally positive towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy as primary prophylaxis in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (87.6 vs. 82.1%; P = 0.40) but not in non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (57.3 vs. 83.9%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physicians were more positive towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy as secondary prophylaxis (98.9 vs. 84.2%; P = 0.001) compared with non-physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physicians focus on clinical rather than psychosocial issues when discussing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment with candidate patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the same time, physicians are more aware that their attitude towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment may influence how they deal professionally with patients compared with non-physicians </plain></SENT>
