<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Right atrial specimens obtained from 65 patients undergoing valve replacement surgery were divided into three groups: sinus rhythm group (n= 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group (PaAF; n= 10), and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group (PeAF; AF lasting &gt;6 month; n= 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein content for CIB1, calcineurin B, calcineurin A, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger-1 (NCX1) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also measured the combination of CIB1 with calcineurin B, L-type Ca(2+) channel, and NCX1 using immunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein content of CIB1, calcineurin B, calcineurin A, and NCX1 was increased in the AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcium- and integrin-binding protein-1 interacted with calcineurin B and L-type Ca(2+) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, CIB1 also combined with NCX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CIB1 and calcineurin expression was increased in AF atrial tissue and was related to the type of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that CIB1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF in VHD patients </plain></SENT>
