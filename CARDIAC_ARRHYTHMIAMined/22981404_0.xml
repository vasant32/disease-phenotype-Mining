<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and disproportionately affects the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study describes patient characteristics and caregiver assistance among Medicare beneficiaries with AF and examines factors associated with receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with AF and age/gender-matched controls were identified from Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data from 2001 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in a subgroup of patients with AF whose treatment pattern was established for 2 consecutive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sample weights were applied to obtain nationally representative estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2990 patients with AF and 5980 control patients were included in the burden of disease analysis, and 1481 patients with AF were included in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> predictor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF had a higher level of comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index: 3.3 vs 1.5; P &lt; 0.05), worse self-perceived health status (P &lt; 0.001), and greater level of disability (P &lt; 0.001) than their matched counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of patients with AF required caregiver assistance (62.8% vs 51.5%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression found that higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, difficulty in obtaining necessary health care, older age, being widowed, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, and being underweight decreased the likelihood of receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a Medicare population, a greater need for caregiver assistance was observed in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subgroups characterized by frailty or inability for self-care were identified as being less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The need for caregiver assistance among patients with AF, as well as the patient subgroups identified as less likely to receive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, should be considered when making treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
