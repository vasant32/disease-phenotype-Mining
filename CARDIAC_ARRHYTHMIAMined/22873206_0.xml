<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of hypercholesterolemic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and hypertrigliceridemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> dose on LRP1 expression in cardiomyocytes, as well as the potential correlation between LRP1 expression and neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in the left ventricle tissue from ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Explanted hearts from 18 ICM patients and eight non-diseased hearts (<z:chebi fb="46" ids="50594">CNT</z:chebi>) were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that LRP1 upregulation is key for myocardial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi> accumulation in ischemic human hearts and that LRP1 may be a target to prevent the deleterious effects of myocardial cholesterol accumulation in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
