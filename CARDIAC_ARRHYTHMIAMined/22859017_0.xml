<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on two prenatal ultrasound diagnoses of left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011664'>non-compaction cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (LVNC) associated with mutation of the cardiac Î²-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LVNC is characterized by a trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular myocardial recesses communicating with the left ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features range from non-penetrant disease in adult carriers to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both cases showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> on prenatal ultrasound examinations, with features indicating non-compaction of the myocardium apparent in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the MYH7 gene were identified postnatally in each case in both the proband and the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One infant underwent surgical mitral valvuloplasty and a mechanical valve implant later; in the other, left ventricular function was unimpaired at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function in both cases remained stable at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases highlight the importance of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of LVNC and the need for cardiologic and molecular testing of first-degree relatives who may be unknown carriers of an MYH7 mutation </plain></SENT>
