<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective is to describe the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the AMC in patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo>, who had been successfully treated by catheter ablation at the AMC beneath the aortic valve, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data and electrocardiographic characteristics were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the 10 patients had previously registered episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and had undergone catheter ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four patients with anterior AMC location, early R/S wave transition was found in the precordial leads, with equal R and S amplitudes in V2, rS in V1, and R in V3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six patients whose VT arose from the middle part of the AMC, we demonstrated a special ('rebound') transition pattern, with which equal R and S amplitudes occurred in V2, and high R waves in V1 and V3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the anterior AMC location, the S/R ratios in leads V1 and V2 were &gt;1 and statistically significantly higher than those located in the middle (V1: 1.59 vs. 0.23, P&lt; 0.001; V2: 1.52 vs. 0.41, P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> arising from the AMC with different R/S wave transition patterns in the precordial leads on the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There may be a relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> from AMC and AVNRT </plain></SENT>
