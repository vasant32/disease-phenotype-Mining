<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> is mainly determined by progressive morphologically <z:mp ids='MP_0006044'>tricuspid valve regurgitation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and/or systemic ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Situs abnormalities have been reported in ≤34% of cases, but whether clinical differences exist between a <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> and situs solitus arrangement has not yet been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical records of 38 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (mean age 40 ± 15 years) followed for a mean period of 7.4 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 38 patients, 8 presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> and 30 with situs solitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, pulmonary tract stenosis, previous surgical repair, or duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, none of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> presented with an Ebstein-like anomaly of the morphologically tricuspid valve and none developed nonoperative-related complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> compared to 15 (50%; p = 0.013) and 11 (42%; p = 0.032) of the patients with situs solitus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 2 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> (25%) presented with sustained atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo>, or severe systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1562095" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">right ventricular systolic dysfunction</z:e> compared to 22 (73%) of 30 those with situs solitus (p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> presented with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> compared to 12 (40%) of 30 with situs solitus (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Ebstein-like anomaly or spontaneous complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> are rare in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp>, and late complications are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcome of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> was significantly better than that for patients with situs solitus </plain></SENT>
