<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) have progressed greatly in the past decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few data are currently available regarding the impact of HF on the in-hospital outcomes of ACS patients, under current treatment status, in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 65 hospitals from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 31 provinces of mainland China and the Hong Kong special administrative region were recruited using a multistage non-randomized sampling approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was completed according to the medical records of 3168 ACS patients, of which 706 (22.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF and 262 (8.3%) HF patients did not have an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rates of in-hospital mortality and composite end-point events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, myocardial re-/infarction, serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF patients were significantly higher than those of HF patients without an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode and patients without HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for other factors (including age, ACS types and in-hospital treatments, etc.), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF remained to be a potent independent predictor of in-hospital mortality and composite end-point events for ACS patients (OR=7.50, 95% CI=4.32-13.02 and OR=2.74, 95% CI=2.15-3.48, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The utilization rates of guideline recommended treatments for ACS complicating HF, such as Î²-blockers (67.6%) and PCI (17.4%), were low in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Under current treatment status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HF during hospitalization still rendered higher rates of in-hospital mortality and composite end-point events in the studied ACS patients in China </plain></SENT>
