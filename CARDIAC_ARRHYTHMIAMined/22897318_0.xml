<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PAF naturally progresses toward persistent AF with an increase in the frequency and duration of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the preprocedural AF frequency had an impact on the AF recurrence after PVAI in patients with symptomatic PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 362 consecutive patients (61.0 Â± 9.8 years; 274 males) with drug-refractory PAF who underwent PVAI were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preprocedural frequency of PAF was daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly in 145 (40.1%), 112 (30.9%), 90 (24.9%), and 15 (4.1%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in any of the preprocedural variables between the four groups, except for the number of ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PVAI was successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months after the initial procedure, 63.5% of the entire group of patients were free of AF recurrences without any AADs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A Cox regression multivariate analysis of the variables including the AF frequency, age, gender, duration of AF, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, left atrial size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and body mass index demonstrated that the AF frequency was not an independent predictor of AF recurrence after a single ablation procedure (P = 0.194) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the preprocedural AF frequency did not predict AF recurrence after PVAI in patients with PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the clinical point of view, an additional AF classification based on the preprocedural AF frequency might not be valuable in patients undergoing PVAI </plain></SENT>
