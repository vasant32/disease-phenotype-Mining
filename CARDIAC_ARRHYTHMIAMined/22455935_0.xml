<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this large-scale registry was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CLS therapy under clinical routine conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 706 patients was enrolled in the clinical investigation 'Registry: CYLOS Routine Documentation' (RECORD) at 57 investigational sites in Europe and Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not to interfere with clinical routine and therapeutic decisions of health care providers, the registry was implemented as a part of the standard follow-up schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two follow-ups were conducted within 12 months of enrolment in order to evaluate typical programming of CLS-related parameters, reasons for their later reprogramming, frequency of patient intolerance to CLS, and physicians' satisfaction with medical benefits and technical performance of CLS in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The investigators' medical and technical notes on CLS rated it excellent in ~80% of patients, poor in 1.4% (medical benefit) or 0.5% (technical performance), and adequate in rest of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Closed Loop Stimulation functionality was not influenced by pacing site variation within the right ventricle (septal, outflow tract) or by advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (New York Heart Association classes II-IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent or temporary CLS deactivation was undertaken for various reasons in 6.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Signs of intolerance to CLS or rate-adaptive pacing were reported by 2.3% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming of CLS-related parameters was seldom undertaken, with &gt;90% of pacemakers operating with default settings in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical performance of CLS was very satisfactory in the large cohort studied </plain></SENT>
