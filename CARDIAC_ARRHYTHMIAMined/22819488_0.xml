<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A defibrillation threshold (DFT) at least 10 J below the maximum device output is recommended for successful therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Shock waveform configuration is a programmable parameter used to achieve a low DFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that a fixed-pulse configuration results in lower defibrillation energy requirements than a fixed-tilt configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: 10 mongrel dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> generator and transvenous lead were surgically implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defibrillation threshold was determined using a protocol guided by the upper limit of vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fixed-pulse and fixed-tilt (50%/50%) waveform configurations were tested in a random order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was measured for signs of myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The experiment was completed in 9 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall mean DFT value was 424 ± 88 V (9.2 ± 3.9 J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean differences among voltage, energy and impedance at the DFT for fixed-pulse (422 ± 97 V, 9.1 ± 4.2 J, 62.6 ± 13.8 Ω) and fixed-tilt (426 ± 83 V, 9.3 ± 3.8 J, 62.8 ± 18.5 Ω) configurations were not statistically significant (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiac TnI concentration changed from 0.03 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.02-0.04) at baseline to 0.11 ng/mL (95 CI: 0.08-0.16) after DFT was obtained with the first waveform configuration and 0.19 ng/mL (95% CI: 0.13-0.28) at the end of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes in heart rate, end-tidal <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and blood pressure over time (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The tested <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> device and lead placement reliably produced acceptable DFT values, based on a 10-J safety margin below the maximum device output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A benefit of fixed-pulse configuration could not be demonstrated over the standard fixed-tilt waveform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial damage from repeated high-voltage shocks and episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> seemed of limited clinical significance </plain></SENT>
