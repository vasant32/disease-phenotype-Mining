<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the SCN5A gene, which codes for <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel Na(v) 1.5, are found in 38% of familial cases of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> current dysfunction negatively affects the cardiac fast response action potential, particularly in atrial and ventricular myocytes and in the fast-conducting Purkinje system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To detect carriers of SCN5A mutations without using the characteristic repolarization pattern (type 1 Brugada ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 141 members of three different families including 55 carriers of two nonsense SCN5A mutations causing BS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those aged over 16 (113 individuals, 42 carriers) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PR interval (PR) and QT dispersion (QTd) between leads V1 and V3 were measured on conventional ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using signal-averaged ECG the total duration of the filtered QRS complex (<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>), the root-mean-square (RMS40) and the low-amplitude signal (LAS) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following procedures were developed to detect carriers/To detect carriers the following procedures were developed: (1) a screening test (ScreenTest) with PS (PR+<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>) &gt; or = 250 (250ms is 80% of the theoretical maximum in healthy individuals); and (2) a diagnostic test (DiagTest) for the simultaneous fulfillment of four conditions: PS &gt; or = 250 and QTd &gt; or = 10 and LAS &gt; 26 and RMS40 &lt; or = 29 (the latter two cut-offs are approximately 70% of the theoretical maximum in healthy carriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant differences in PR, QTd, QRSf, RMS40 and LAS were found between carriers and non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SCN5A gene was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these variables, the strongest association being with PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both tests were applied to 63 family members (38 carriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ScreenTest was positive in 38 of 38 carriers, with eight false positives in 27 non-carriers (sensitivity [SE] = 100% and specificity [SP] = 66.67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From ROC curve analysis a cut-off of PS = 252.5 shows SE = 100% and SP = 76% and a cut-off of PS = 260 shows SE=94.7% and SP = 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The DiagTest was positive in 36 of 38 carriers, with three false positives: SE = 94.74% and SP = 88.89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From ROC curve analysis a multivariate logistic model identifies a cut-off with SE = 92% and SP = 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the same group the SE and SP of the characteristic spontaneous repolarization pattern (type 1 Brugada ECG) to detect carriers were 52.4% and 97.2%, respectively, and the difference between the SE of the DiagTest and of the typical repolarization pattern is statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ScreenTest and DiagTest are more effective tools than the characteristic repolarization pattern to discriminate between carriers and non-carriers of these two nonsense SCN5A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We suggest their use in first-degree relatives of Brugada patients when the results of genetic testing are not available, in a score of disease probability in individuals with idiopathic Brugada ECG, and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or other Brugada-related symptoms presenting type 2 or type 3 Brugada ECG </plain></SENT>
