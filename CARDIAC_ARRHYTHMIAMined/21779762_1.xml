<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accentuated right ventricular (RV) gradients in action potential duration (APD) have been implicated in the arrhythmogenicity observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> in studies assuming that ventricular effective refractory periods (VERPs) vary in concert with APDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiments use a genetically modified mouse model to explore spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in VERP that in turn might affect conduction velocity, thereby causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation latencies, APDs and VERPs recorded during programmed S1S2 protocols were compared in RV and left ventricular (LV) epicardia and endocardia of Langendorff-perfused <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and Scn5a (+/-) hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scn5a (+/-) and WT hearts showed similar patterns of shorter VERPs in RV than LV epicardia, and in epicardia than endocardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed longer VERPs, despite shorter APD(90)s, than WT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pro- and anti-arrhythmic agents flecainide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> increased regional VERPs despite respectively decreasing and increasing the corresponding APD(90)s particularly in Scn5a (+/-) RV epicardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed greater VERP gradients between neighbouring regions, particularly RV transmural gradients, than WT (9.1 ± 1.1 vs. 5.7 ± 0.5 ms, p &lt; 0.05, n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flecainide increased (to 21 ± 0.9 ms, p &lt; 0.05, n = 6) but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> decreased (to 4.5 ± 0.5 ms, p &lt; 0.05, n = 6) these gradients, particularly across the Scn5a (+/-) RV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed greater conduction slowing than WT following S2 stimuli, particularly with flecainide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather than arrhythmogenesis resulting from increased transmural repolarization gradients in an early, phase 2, reentrant excitation mechanism, the present findings implicate RV VERP gradients in potential reentrant mechanisms involving impulse conduction slowed by partial refractoriness </plain></SENT>
