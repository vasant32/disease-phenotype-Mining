<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although coronary CT angiography (CTA) shows high diagnostic performance for detection and exclusion of obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, limited temporal resolution of current-generation CT scanners may allow for motion artifacts, which may result in nonevaluable coronary segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We assessed a novel vendor-specific motion-correction algorithm for its effect on image quality and diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> undergoing coronary CTA without rate control and invasive coronary angiography as part of an evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared image quality and diagnostic accuracy between standard (STD) and motion-corrected (MC) reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronary CTAs were interpreted in an intent-to-diagnose fashion by 2 experienced readers; a third reader provided consensus for interpretability and obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> (≥50% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were interpreted with and without motion correction using both 45% and 75% of the R-R interval for reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative coronary angiography was performed by a core laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 83.0 ± 6.4 years; 47% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall image quality (graded 1-4) was higher with the use of MC versus STD reconstructions (2.9 ± 0.9 vs 2.4 ± 1.0; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MC reconstructions showed higher interpretability on a per-segment [97% (392/406) vs 88% (357/406); P &lt; 0.001] and per-artery [96% (128/134) vs 84% (112/134); P = 0.002] basis, with no difference on a per-patient level [92% (33/36) vs 89% (32/36); P = 1.0] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy by MC reconstruction was higher than STD reconstruction on a per-segment [91% (370/406) vs 78% (317/406); P &lt; 0.001] and per-artery level [86% (115/134) vs 72% (96/134); P = 0.007] basis, with no significant difference on a per-patient level [86% (31/36) vs 69% (25/36); P = 0.16] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of a novel MC algorithm improves image quality, interpretability, and diagnostic accuracy in persons undergoing coronary CTA without rate-control medications </plain></SENT>
