<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether impedance readings are a useful tool to detect compound effects on beating frequency (beats per minute, bpm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of human induced pluripotent stem cell- and a mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte line (hiPSC-CM and mESC-CM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline values for control wells were 45±3 and 179±6 bpm, respectively (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> increased beating frequency by 77% and 71%, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi> decreased frequency by 11% and 100% (stopped in 5/6 mESC-CM wells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E-4031 decreased beating rate and caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in both cell types, however, more pronounced in the human iPSC-CMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> inhibited contractions in both models, and T-type calcium channel block strongly reduced beating rate and eventually stopped beating in mESC-CM but caused a smaller effect in hiPSC-CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this initial study show that, under the right conditions, the beating frequency of a monolayer of cells can be stably recorded over several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the system detects changes in beating frequency and amplitude caused by added reference compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This assay system has the potential to enable medium-throughput screening, but for implementation into routine daily work, extended validation, testing of additional batches of cardiomyocytes, and further assay optimization (e.g., frequency of media exchange, growth matrix, seeding density, age of cells after plating, and temperature control) will be needed </plain></SENT>
