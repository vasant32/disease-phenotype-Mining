<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in these channel subunits lead to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about the gating mechanisms underlying KCNQ1 channel activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shaker channels have provided a powerful tool to establish the basic gating mechanisms of voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels, implying prior independent movement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four voltage sensor domains (<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSDs</z:mp>) followed by channel opening via a last concerted cooperative transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the nature of KCNQ1 channel gating, we performed a thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis by constructing a concatenated tetrameric KCNQ1 channel and by introducing separately a gain and a loss of function mutation, R231W and R243W, respectively, into the S4 helix of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> of one, two, three, and four subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The R231W mutation destabilizes channel closure and produces constitutively open channels, whereas the R243W mutation disrupts channel opening solely in the presence of KCNE1 by right-shifting the voltage dependence of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The linearity of the relationship between the shift in the voltage dependence of activation and the number of mutated subunits points to an independence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> movements, with each subunit incrementally contributing to channel gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to Shaker channels, our work indicates that KCNQ1 channels do not experience a late cooperative concerted opening transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that KCNQ1 channels in both the absence and the presence of KCNE1 undergo sequential gating transitions leading to channel opening even before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSDs</z:mp> have moved </plain></SENT>
