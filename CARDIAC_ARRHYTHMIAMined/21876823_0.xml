<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current available therapies remain inadequate in symptom control and secondary prevention and are often associated with significant side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AF are poorly understood, although electrophysiological remodeling has been described as an important initiating step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, increasing evidence implicates <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We searched the literature for evidence to support the use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E in the prevention of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These vitamins, through their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26523">reactive-oxygen-species</z:chebi>- (ROS-) scavenging effect, have shown a role in AF prevention in both animal and small clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The available evidence, however, is currently insufficient to support recommendations for their use in the wider patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger-scale clinical studies are required to confirm these preliminary results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Research is also required to further the understanding of the processes involved in the pathogenesis of AF and the role of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapies to prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
