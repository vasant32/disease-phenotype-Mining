<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: We assessed the efficacy, reliability and cost of an in-home control service, devoted to debilitated patients with pacemakers, during long-term follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We admitted 802 patients (mean age 87.8 ± 6.9 years) with pacemakers into our program, which were monitored periodically during in-home visits by nurses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During these controls, patients underwent a standard electrocardiogram with and without magnet, during which stimulation intervals were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-home pacemaker assessments were performed by a portable programmer only for patients with Biotronik pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms and technical data were evaluated at hospital, and a report was sent by mail to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we compared the costs for the hospital, patients and society between in-home and ambulatory assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 80 months of follow up, 2418 controls were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The monthly average of patients who were followed at home was 283.9 ± 23.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of controls per month was 30.2 ± 10 (range 4-51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-three pacemakers were replaced due to battery exhaustion, after a mean device longevity of 7.4 years (range 4.9-12.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and sixty-eight patients died (8.7% annual mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (annual incidence 0.3%) were invited to in-hospital visits for reprogramming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cumulative cost for in-home assessment were 20.5% lower than conventional in-hospital controls and 66.5% lower if patients are transported by ambulance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elderly debilitated patients can be monitored by effective and reliable pacemaker assessments at home, alleviating them and their families from the issues that are associated with their transfer from the home to the hospital and concurrently reducing overall costs </plain></SENT>
