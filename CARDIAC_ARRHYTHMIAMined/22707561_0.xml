<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested a hypothesis that pharmacological modification of gap junction (GJ) conductance affects the stability of SW reentry in a two-dimensional (2D) epicardial ventricular muscle layer prepared by endocardial cryoablation of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Action potential signals were recorded and analyzed by high-resolution optical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carbenoxolone (CBX; 30 μM) and rotigaptide (RG, 0.1 μM) were used to inhibit and enhance GJ coupling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBX decreased the space constant (λ) by 36%, whereas RG increased it by 22-24% (n = 5; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During centrifugal propagation, there was a linear relationship between the wavefront curvature (κ) and local conduction velocity (LCV): LCV = LCV(0) - D·κ (D, diffusion coefficient; LCV(0), LCV at κ = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBX decreased LCV(0) and D by 27 ± 3 and 57 ± 3%, respectively (n = 5; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RG increased LCV(0) and D by 18 ± 3 and 54 ± 5%, respectively (n = 5, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The regression lines with and without RG crossed, resulting in a paradoxical decrease of LCV with RG at κ &gt; ~60 cm(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SW reentry induced after CBX was stable, and the incidence of sustained VTs (&gt;30 s) increased from 38 ± 4 to 85 ± 4% after CBX (n = 18; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SW reentry induced after RG was characterized by decremental conduction near the rotation center, prominent drift and self-termination by collision with the anatomical boundaries, and the incidence of sustained VTs decreased from 40 ± 5 to 17 ± 6% after RG (n = 13; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that decreased intercellular coupling stabilizes SW reentry in 2D cardiac muscle, whereas increased coupling facilitates its early self-termination </plain></SENT>
