<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation has been applied to <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue to cause reversible conduction block, but has not been explored sufficiently in cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that reversible propagation block can be achieved in cardiac tissue by holding myocardial cells in a refractory state for a designated period of time by applying a sustained sinusoidal high-frequency alternating current (HFAC); in doing so, reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate proof of concept using several models, including optically mapped monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, Langendorff-perfused guinea pig and rabbit hearts, intact anesthetized adult rabbits, and computer simulations of whole-heart impulse propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HFAC may be an effective and potentially safer alternative to direct current application, currently used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
