<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous echo contrast resolved with ventricular pacing, representing visual evidence for dependence of some AF patients with poor atrial transport function on ventricular emptying with potential greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> related to a long ventricular pause </plain></SENT>
