<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen dogs were divided into three groups (five dogs/group): group 1 (pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group), group 2 (100 mM <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group), group 3 (500 mM <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five sites from the left atrium in each dog were used as recording sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electric stimulations were used to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effective refractory period (ERP) of each recording site and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> inducibility index were obtained at baseline and following sustained atrial tachypacing for 4 h (group 1) or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) application (groups 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, recording sites with CFAEs were identified and domain frequency of CFAE was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ERPs decreased significantly compared to baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in decrements of ERPs at each site after pacing in group 1 (P = 0.646); in groups 2 and 3, significant differences were found in decrements of ERPs following <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> application when each site was compared (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> inducibility index increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups compared to baseline (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the first induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, CFAEs were recorded at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of domain frequencies in group 1 when each site was compared (P = 0.509), but significant differences in domain frequencies were found in groups 2 and 3 when each site was compared (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We identified that various characteristics of CFAEs may exist in different experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may indicate different mechanisms of CFAEs </plain></SENT>
