<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This prospective study sought to assess the incidence and predictors of major complications from contemporary catheter ablation procedures at a high-volume center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 1,676 consecutive ablation procedures were prospectively evaluated for major complications throughout 30 days postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of major complications were determined in a multivariate analysis adjusted for demographics, clinical variables, ablation type, and procedural factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates of major complications differed between procedure types, ranging from 0.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, 3.4% for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT), 5.2% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and 6.0% for VT associated with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (SHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ablation type (ablation for AF [odds ratio (OR) 5.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.81 to 16.83], for VT with SHD [OR 8.61, 95% CI 2.37 to 31.31], or for idiopathic VT [OR 5.93, 95% CI 1.40 to 25.05] <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> referenced to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> ablation), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level &gt;1.5 mg/dl (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.76) were associated with increased adjusted risk of major complications, whereas age, gender, body mass index, international normalized ratio level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> were not associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of contemporary catheter ablation, major complication rates ranged between 0.8% and 6.0% depending on the ablation procedure performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aside from ablation type, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> was the only independent predictor of a major complication </plain></SENT>
