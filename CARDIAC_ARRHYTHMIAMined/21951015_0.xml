<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long QT Syndrome</z:hpo> is a common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorder</z:e> where ventricular repolarization is delayed, abnormally prolonging the QTc interval on electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LQTS is linked to various genetic loci, including the KCNH2 (HERG) gene that encodes the Î±-subunit of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel that carries I(Kr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report and characterize a novel pathologic missense mutation, G816V HERG, in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autopsy-derived tissue sample was used for DNA extraction and sequencing from an unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> victim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The G816V HERG mutation was studied using heterologous expression in mammalian cell culture, whole cell patch clamp, confocal immunofluorescence, and immunochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mutant G816V HERG channel has reduced protein expression and shows a trafficking defective phenotype that is incapable of carrying current when expressed at physiological temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutant channel showed reduced cell surface localization compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HERG (WT HERG) but the mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> subunits are capable of interacting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression studies at reduced temperatures enabled partial rescue of the trafficking defect with appearance of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents, albeit with reduced current density and altered voltage-dependent activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we examined a potential role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> as a contributory factor to the patient's lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> by possible low-<z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>-induced degradation of WT HERG and haplo-insufficiency of G816V HERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The G816V mutation in HERG causes a trafficking defect that acts in a partially dominant negative manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This intermediate severity defect agrees with the mild clinical presentation in other family members harboring the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> in the proband induced WT HERG degradation combined with haplo-insufficiency may have further compromised repolarization reserve and contributed to the lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
