<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental and modeling studies demonstrate the fine spatial scale, complex nature, and independent contribution of Ca(2+) dynamics as a proarrhythmic factor in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of progression of cell-level Ca(2+) instabilities, known as alternans, to tissue-level <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because gap junction coupling dictates cardiac syncytial properties, we set out to elucidate its role in the spatiotemporal evolution of Ca(2+) instabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We experimentally perturbed cellular coupling in cardiac syncytium in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coupling was quantified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and related to function, including subtle fine-scale Ca(2+) alternans, captured by optical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity and threshold for alternans monotonically increased with coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower coupling enhanced Ca(2+) alternans amplitude, but the spatial spread of early (&lt;2 Hz) alternation was the greatest under intermediate (not low) coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This nonmonotonic relationship was closely matched by the percent of samples exhibiting large-scale alternans at higher pacing rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computer modeling corroborated these experimental findings for strong but not weak electromechanical (voltage-Ca(2+)) coupling, and offered mechanistic insight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, using experimental and modeling approaches, we reveal a general mechanism for the spatial spread of subtle cellular Ca(2+) alternans that relies on a combination of gap-junctional and voltage-Ca(2+) coupling </plain></SENT>
