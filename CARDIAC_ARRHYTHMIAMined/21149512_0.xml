<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The database was searched for patients who had CABG surgery and had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> within 4 months of surgery, between 1999 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records were reviewed for LVEF, status of revascularization, programmed electrical stimulation results, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were: combined total mortality (TM) and appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T), and the individual outcomes of TM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-four patients were identified, 69 had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and were followed till June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean pre- and post-operative LVEFs were 29 and 33%, 46 (67%) had incomplete revascularization, and 38 (55%) had inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the mean follow-up of 40 months, 20 patients (29%) died and 18 (26%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the Cox proportional hazard model, the following variables were significant at the 0.05 level; for the combined outcome TM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) class III/IV and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) + valvular disease; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T outcome: CAD + valvular disease; for TM outcome: female gender, LVEF &lt; 35%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> class III/IV, and lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical assessment of CABG patients can assist in selecting a high-risk group with TM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-T rates comparable to those of primary prevention studies and could be useful for future randomized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> studies in this selective group of patients </plain></SENT>
