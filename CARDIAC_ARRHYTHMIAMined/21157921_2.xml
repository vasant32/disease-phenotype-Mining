<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to describe changes in myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and to characterize arrhythmogenic substrate in rat model of developing HF due to volume overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (AVF) was created in male Wistar rats between the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta using needle technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and connexin43 distribution, localization and phosphorylation were examined using confocal microscopy and Western blotting in the stage of compensated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (11 weeks), and decompensated HF (21 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart to body weight (BW) ratio was 89% and 133% higher in AVF rats at 11 and 21 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 21 weeks but not 11 weeks, AVF rats had <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> (increased lung to BW ratio) indicating presence of decompensated HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The myocytes in left ventricular midmyocardium were significantly thicker (+8% and +45%) and longer (+88% and +97%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, there was no excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the AVF ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distribution and localization of connexin43 were similar between groups, but its phosphorylation was significantly lower in AVF hearts at 21st week, but not 11th week, suggesting that HF, rather than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> contributes to the connexin43 hypophosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, volume overload leads to extensive eccentric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, but not to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in this HF model is possibly related to gap junction remodeling with hypophosphorylation of connexin43 </plain></SENT>
