<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficient S-nitrosylation of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) has a variable effect on SR Ca(2+) leak/sparks in isolated myocytes, likely dependent on the underlying physiological state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown, however, whether such molecular aberrancies are causally related to arrhythmogenesis in the intact heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show in the intact heart, reduced NOS1 activity increased Ca(2+)-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> only in the setting of elevated myocardial [Ca(2+)](i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> arose from increased spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release, resulting from a combination of decreased RyR2 S-nitrosylation (RyR2-SNO) and increased RyR2 oxidation (RyR-SOx) (i.e., increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidoreductase activity) and could be suppressed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibition (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50566">nitric oxide donors</z:chebi> (i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">S-nitrosoglutathione</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50091">GSNO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found evidence of NOS1 down-regulation of RyR2 phosphorylation at the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) site (S2814), suggesting molecular cross-talk between nitrosylation and phosphorylation of RyR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox imbalance due to decreased NOS1 activity sensitizes RyR2 to a severe arrhythmic phenotype by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox imbalance is an important mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the intact heart under disease conditions (i.e., elevated [Ca(2+)](i) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>), and that therapies restoring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox balance in the heart could prevent sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
