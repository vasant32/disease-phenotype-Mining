<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to explore if proarrhythmic responses to flecainide noted in cardiac patients may be partly attributed to abnormal changes in repolarization and refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory periods (ERP) were assessed at distinct epicardial and endocardial sites along with volume-conducted ECG recordings in isolated perfused guinea-pig heart preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flecainide was found to prolong ventricular repolarization, with effect being greater at the left ventricular compared with the right ventricular epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This change translated to reversal of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> right ventricular-to-left ventricular transepicardial APD difference determined before drug infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation between local epicardial APD and corresponding activation time values seen at baseline was eliminated in flecainide-treated hearts, indicating the activation-to-repolarization uncoupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over transmural plane, flecainide produced a greater ERP lengthening at endocardium than epicardium, thus markedly increasing ERP dispersion across ventricular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous short-lasting episodes of monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were observed in 45% of heart preparations upon flecainide infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in nonischemic guinea-pig heart, flecainide-induced proarrhythmia may be partly attributed to abnormal spatial gradients in repolarization and refractoriness and impaired transepicardial activation-to-repolarization coupling </plain></SENT>
