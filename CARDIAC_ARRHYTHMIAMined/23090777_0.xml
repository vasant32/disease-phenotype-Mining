<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known of the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> associated with the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and the reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> after cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to examine the reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in patients undergoing ablation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 625 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation for tachycardiarrhymias between January 2009 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography analysis was performed to identify patients with depressed LV function, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with preexisting structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (n = 10) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NT-pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) assessment was performed before ablation in patients considered to have TCM (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeated echocardiography study and NT-proBNP assessment were measured after a mean follow-up of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of NT-proBNP before and after ablation were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of TCM was 2.7 % (12 males; age, 35.8 ± 17.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation was performed in 16 of 17 patients (94.1 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (36.7 ± 7.5 vs. 59.4 ± 9.7 %; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter before treatment was 59.5 ± 8.3 mm (range, 43 to 70), compared with 51.9 ± 7.4 mm (range, 40 to 67) (P = 0.009) after 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The levels of NT-proBNP decreased after ablation procedure, from 4,092.6 ± 3,916.6 to 478.9 ± 881.9 pg/ml (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After successful ablation, ventricular function normalized in 15 of 17 (88.2 %) patients at a mean of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of LV function and reversal of LV remodeling can be achieved with successful elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP level elevates in subjects with TCM and decreases sharply after ablation </plain></SENT>
