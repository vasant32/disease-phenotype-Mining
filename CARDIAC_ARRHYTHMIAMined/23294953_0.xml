<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one patients operated on between January 2004 to September 2010 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The demographic data of the patients,clinical features, type of surgical procedure performed, postoperative complications, mortality and duration of hospital stay (DHS) after surgery were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean hospital stay, wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and mortality did not differ significantly between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superficial wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was higher in group A (32% vs15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Development of leaks secondary to stoma closure was not observed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During hospitalisation period; the postoperative complications were wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in four patients, intraabdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in two, evisceration and wound dehiscence in two, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in six, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in eight.Medical and surgical complication rates of the groups were not different (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared, the durations of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were not statistically different (p&gt;0.05), but mean duration of hospital stay (DHS) was longer in group A than group B (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sigmoidectomy should be the basic principle in the management of sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo>.RPA with modified blow - hole colostomy provides satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is easy to perform in patients with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RPA with modified blow - hole colostomy can be performed safely in selected patients without increasing morbidity and DHS </plain></SENT>
