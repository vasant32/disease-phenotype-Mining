<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The anatomical location of the reentry circuit in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>-sensitive atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> originating from the vicinity of atrioventricular node (V-AT) is not well clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the reentry circuit of V-AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 17 patients with V-AT, rapid atrial pacing at a rate 5 beats/min faster than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> rate was delivered from multiple sites of the right atrium (RA) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> to define the direction of the proximity of the slow conduction area of the reentry circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After identification of manifest entrainment and orthodromic capture of the earliest atrial activation site (EAAS), radiofrequency energy was delivered starting at a site 2 cm away from the EAAS in the direction of the pacing site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency energy application site was then gradually advanced toward EAAS until the termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> to define the entrance of the slow conduction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EAAS was orthodromically captured by pacing delivered from one of the high anterolateral RA (n = 6), high posteroseptal RA (n = 9), and RA appendage (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency energy delivery to the site, 10.1 ± 2.8 mm away from the EAAS, terminated V-AT immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of delivery (2.9 ± 1.0 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The successful ablation site located outside the Koch's triangle, being more distant from the His bundle site than the EAAS (12.4 ± 2.9 vs 6.4 ± 1.9 mm; P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reentry circuit of V-AT located outside the Koch's triangle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>V-AT was eliminated by the radiofrequency energy delivered to the entrance of the reentry circuit, which was more distant from the His bundle site than the EAAS, under the navigation of entrainment </plain></SENT>
