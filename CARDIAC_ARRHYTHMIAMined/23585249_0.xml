<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, CRT pacemakers were implanted in six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 23 days, 175 biventricular threshold tests were conducted with various configurations of pace/sense polarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biventricular IEGMs were recorded and downloaded for offline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Template signals for each pace/sense configuration in each chamber were created for individual dogs during the first follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each pace was annotated for capture or non-capture by visual examination of the IEGM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 9991 capture paces and 4474 non-capture paces were included for morphological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The calculated ASCI values were well separated for capture and non-capture paces irrespective of right/left pacing chambers, pace/sense configurations, pacing amplitude, individual dogs, and temporal proximity of the capture templates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the classification accuracy of the algorithm remained â‰¥99% for any ASCI cut-off value choosing between 0.18 and 0.52.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the feasibility to perform automatic biventricular capture verification based on morphological analysis of the IEGM </plain></SENT>
