<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> by conventional long-term ECG can be cumbersome because of poor p-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Esophageal long-term electrocardiography (eECG) has an excellent sensitivity for atrial signals and may overcome this limitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal lead insertion depth (OLID) is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We registered eECGs at different lead insertion depths in 27 patients and analyzed 199,716 atrial complexes with respect to signal amplitude and slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlation and regression analyses were used to find a criterion for OLID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atrial signal amplitudes and slopes significantly depend on lead insertion depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OLID correlates with body height (rSpearman=0.71) and can be estimated by OLID [cm]=0.25*body height[cm]-7cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At this insertion depth, we recorded the largest esophageal atrial signal amplitudes (1.27±0.86mV), which were much larger compared to conventional surface lead II (0.19±0.10mV, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The OLID depends on body height and can be calculated by a simple regression formula </plain></SENT>
