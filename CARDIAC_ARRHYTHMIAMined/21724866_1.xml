<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A postgenome challenge is to classify the functional roles of genes in cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To unveil the functional role of various genetic isoforms of ion channels in generating cardiac pacemaking action potentials (APs), a mathematical model for spontaneous APs of mouse sinoatrial node (SAN) cells was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model takes into account the biophysical properties of membrane ionic currents and intracellular mechanisms contributing to spontaneous mouse SAN APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was validated by its ability to reproduce the physiological exceptionally short APs and high pacing rates of mouse SAN cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional roles of individual membrane currents were evaluated by blocking their coding channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The roles of intracellular Ca(2+)-handling mechanisms on cardiac pacemaking were also investigated in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The robustness of model pacemaking behavior was evaluated by means of one- and two-parameter analyses in wide parameter value ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model provides a predictive tool for cellular level outcomes of electrophysiological experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It forms the basis for future model development and further studies into complex pacemaking mechanisms as more quantitative experimental data become available </plain></SENT>
