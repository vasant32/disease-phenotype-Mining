<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The advent of metabolic surgery and the increasing focus on the substantial resolution rate of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) call for additional fundamental investigations as to the mechanisms behind this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These investigations require an adequate animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to develop a reproducible survival model of LRYGB performed in a large animal at a tertiary university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LRYGB was performed on 11 Yorkshire pigs that where then followed for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operative time, morbidity, and mortality were recorded for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Necropsy was performed, and the anastomoses were harvested and inspected for leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surgical technique and difficulties are carefully described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 pigs, 10 survived to the end of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was from intraoperative cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complications consisted of a postoperative febrile episode in 2 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean initial weight was 31.5 ± 3.4 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean operative time was 214 ± 71 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No anastomotic leaks were identified at necropsy or on histologic examination of anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> at the end of the study period was .8 ± 1.4 kg compared with an expected 17.5 kg <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have described an effective survival porcine model of LRYGB that can be consistently reproduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This will enable additional investigation into the complex physiologic mechanisms that control hunger, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, and the development, as well as resolution, of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, potentially leading to the development of novel, targeted bariatric procedures and diabetic treatments </plain></SENT>
