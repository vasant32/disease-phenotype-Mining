<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction is an indicator of quality of care and a key factor for patients' healthcare choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation is now common, there are no published data on patient satisfaction during this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anonymous patient satisfaction questionnaires were distributed to consecutive AF ablation patients over 6 months at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 101 questionnaires returned, 51 % related to a first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative clinic experiences were good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to ablation, 53 % reported receiving information leaflets, while 55 % reported using the Internet to search for further information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> pre-procedurally on a ten-point scale was 3.1 ± 2.9 and 97 % of patients felt prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Afterwards, however, 31 % found the experience not as expected, mainly due to being in more pain or more awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large number of patients recalled the procedure in detail, despite use of conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall cath lab experience was good or excellent for the majority (79 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients felt less well than expected immediately post-procedure and perceived a higher complication rate immediately after ablation (24 %) and at home (32 %) than reported by physicians (4.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite this, 89 % would recommend an AF ablation to a friend or relative, and 96 % would recommend our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most patients are satisfied with the AF ablation experience, but this is not solely dependent on procedural success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dissatisfaction occurs due to unmet expectations, particularly excess pain, i.e. greater than expected, during and after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An improved consent process may improve patient experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Physicians should also address initiatives to reduce pain during AF ablation </plain></SENT>
