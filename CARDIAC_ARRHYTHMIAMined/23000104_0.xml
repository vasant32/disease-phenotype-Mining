<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Findings on electrocardiogram may hint that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) is present when interpreted in the proper context and lead to definitive imaging tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it would be useful to know if electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities also occur in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and whether these are similar to ECG changes with PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this investigation was to determine ECG findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated 62 adults discharged with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> who had no previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary disease</z:e> and had electrocardiogram obtained during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo>, other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, was minor nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes occurring in 13 of 62 (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right atrial enlargement occurred in 4 of 62 (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QRS abnormalities were observed in 24 of 62 (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right-axis deviation and S(1)S(2)S(3) were the most prevalent QRS abnormalities, which occurred in 6 of 62 (9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> and S(1)Q(3)T(3) pattern occurred in 3 of 62 (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> that were not present within 1 month previously or abnormalities that disappeared within 1 month included left-axis deviation, right-axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, S(1)S(2)S(3), S(1)Q(3)T(3), low-voltage QRS complexes, and nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, electrocardiogram in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> often shows QRS abnormalities or nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ECG findings are similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in PE and electrocardiogram cannot assist in the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
