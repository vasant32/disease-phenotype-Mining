<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Monosodium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29988">L-glutamate</z:chebi> (MSG) is a food flavour enhancer and its potential harmfulness to the heart remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether MSG could induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) was created by ligating the coronary artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were monitored by electrocardiogram in the rat in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was estimated by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcium mobilization was monitored by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51739">acridine orange</z:chebi> staining, flow cytometry, DNA laddering, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MSG (i.v.) decreased the heart rate at 0.5 g/kg and serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> at 1.5 g/kg, but could not induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI in vivo, however, MSG (1.5 g/kg, i.v.) induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> could be prevented by blocking the AMPA and N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selectively activating the AMPA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in MI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, AMPA induced calcium mobilization, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in cultured cardiomyocytes, especially when the AMPA receptor desensitization were blocked by cyclothiazide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The above toxic cellular effects of AMPA were abolished by AMPA receptor blockade or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> scavengers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MSG induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, but triggers lethal tachyarrhythmias in myocardial infarcted rats probably by hindering AMPA receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AMPA receptor overstimulation also induces cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which may facilitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
