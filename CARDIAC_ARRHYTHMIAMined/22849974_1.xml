<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the following we report on our first experience of a real-time MRI-guided EP study demonstrating current possibilities and drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Five consecutive patients (one male, four female; mean age 66 ± 11 years) with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, three patients with highly symptomatic typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, presented to our hospital for isthmus ablation, one patient for an EP study and one for slow pathway ablation in atrioventricular node re-entry tachychardia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The four ablations were performed successfully in a conventional EP laboratory and complete bidirectional isthmus block was confirmed in three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the procedure in the EP laboratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients were transferred to a 1.5 T whole-body MRI scanner (Intera) for a diagnostic EP procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two MRI compatible steerable diagnostic/ablation catheters (Vision) were inserted via the femoral sheaths and manipulated by an experienced electrophysiologist using a commercially available interactive real-time steady-state free precession sequence (repetition time = 3 ms, echo time = 1 ms, flip angle = 35°, slice thickness = 10 mm, frame rate = 8/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> catheters could be placed successfully in the right atrium and ventricle, confirmed by intracardiac electrograms, using passive catheter tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, simple programmed stimulation maneuvers were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During and after the procedure, no adverse effects were observed in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first series of patients with real-time MRI-guided placement of multiple catheters with subsequent performance of stimulation maneuvers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Besides the mentioned benefits, this technology still encounters several limitations, which have to be solved before application in a routine clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Challenges arise from delineation of precise surface electrocardiogram recordings in the MRI setting along with intracardiac electrograms, easier handling and visualization of catheters, facilitation of immediate defibrillation in the MRI setting and implementation of an active catheter tracking system </plain></SENT>
