<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: QT interval prolongation reflecting delayed action potential (AP) repolarization is associated with polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and early after depolarizations potentially initiating extrasystolic APs if of sufficient amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current experiments explored contributions of altered re-excitation thresholds for, and conduction of, such extrasystolic APs to arrhythmogenesis in Langendorff-perfused, normokalaemic, control <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hearts and two experimental groups modelling long QT (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> groups consisted of genetically modified, Scn5a(+/Î”KPQ) and hypokalaemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> murine hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hearts were paced from their right ventricles and monophasic AP electrode recordings obtained from their left ventricular epicardia, with recording and pacing electrodes separated by 1 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adaptive programmed electrical stimulation protocol applied pacing (S1) stimulus trains followed by premature (S2) extrastimuli whose amplitudes were progressively increased with progressive decrements in S1S2 interval to maintain stimulus capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such protocols culminated in either arrhythmic or refractory endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arrhythmic outcomes were associated with (1) lower conduction velocities in their initiating extrasystolic APs than refractory outcomes and (2) higher conduction velocities in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> groups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (3) the endpoints were reached at longer S1S2 coupling intervals and with smaller stimulus amplitudes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> groups compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was despite (4) similar relationships between conduction velocity and S1S2 coupling interval and between re-excitation thresholds and S1S2 coupling interval in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by extrasystolic APs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> groups thus occur under conditions of higher conduction velocity and greater sensitivity to extrastimuli than in controls </plain></SENT>
