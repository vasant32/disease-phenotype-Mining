<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of those drugs were recently reported to have both a cutaneous <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> and a neural blocking effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether these drugs have a spinal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (class IA: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, IB: mexiletine, and IC: flecainide) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After they had been intrathecally injected in rats, the potencies and durations of these drugs on spinal anesthesia were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">Bupivacaine</z:chebi>, a commonly used <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi>, and 5% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> solution were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">Bupivacaine</z:chebi>, flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, and mexiletine produced a dose-related spinal blockade of motor function, proprioception, and nociception, but <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> solution produced no spinal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The descending order of potency was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi>&gt;flecainide&gt;<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>&gt;mexiletine (p&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> differences) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On an equipotent basis, flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> produced similar durations of action, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were significantly longer than that of mexiletine (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intrathecal injections of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs produced a dose-related spinal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These drugs may be potential candidates for developing new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
