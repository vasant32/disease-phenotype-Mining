<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to conventional modalities, IRE has a nonthermal mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to study the histopathological and imaging features of IRE in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> swine lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven female swine were studied for hyperacute (8 h), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (24 h), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> (96 h), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (3 week) effects of IRE ablation in lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paired unipolar IRE applicators were placed under computed tomography (CT) guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some applicators were deliberately positioned near bronchovascular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IRE pulse delivery was synchronized with the cardiac rhythm only when ablation was performed within 2 cm of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed immediately before and after IRE and at 1 and 3 weeks after IRE ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Representative tissue was stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin for histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five ablations were created: ten hyperacute, four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> ablations showed alveolar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of bronchial, bronchiolar, and vascular epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bronchovascular architecture was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> ablations showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> and alveolar interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immediate post-procedure CT images showed linear or patchy density along the applicator tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At 1 week, there was consolidation that resolved partially or completely by 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> requiring chest tube developed in two animals; no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary porcine study demonstrates the nonthermal and extracellular matrix sparing mechanism of action of IRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>IRE is a potential alternative to thermal ablative modalities </plain></SENT>
