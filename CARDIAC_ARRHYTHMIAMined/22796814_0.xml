<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF management patterns have important implications for both the patient's quality of life and the utilisation of healthcare resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the management pattern of AF among cardiologists in the Greek healthcare setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to construct the outpatient management model, the patient record data of 149 geographically distributed physicians were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on inpatient resource utilisation were obtained from a consensus panel of AF experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 89.6% of AF patients were treated with pharmacological agents, whereas 5.2% of patients were treated with invasive methods and 5.2% received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 59.5% of patients under pharmacological therapy, a rhythm-control strategy was implemented, whereas for the remaining 40.5% of patients a rate-control strategy was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Class Ic and III antiarrhythmic agents constituted the main therapeutic choices in the rhythm-control strategy, whereas -blockers and digoxin were the most frequently prescribed agents in the rate-control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>89.0% of the patients on pharmacological rhythm control, 91.3% of those on pharmacological rate control, and 100.0% of patients undergoing invasive treatment received antithrombotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of the rhythm disturbance and rhythm management are the dominant choices in AF management made by cardiologists in Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF management requires close patient monitoring, as is reflected in the frequency of follow-up visits and laboratory tests performed, irrespective of treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospitalisations due to AF or related comorbidities are also common </plain></SENT>
