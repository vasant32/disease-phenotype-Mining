<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mechanisms are poorly understood, thus leading to different theories and controversial interpretation of its behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it is unknown why AF is self-terminating in certain individuals, which is called paroxysmal AF (PAF), and not in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the context of biomedical signal analysis, predicting the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PAF with a reasonable advance has been a clinical challenge in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, the loss of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm could be addressed by means of preventive treatments, thus minimizing risks for the patients and improving their quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, the study of PAF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> has been undertaken through a variety of features characterizing P-wave spatial diversity from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or from signal-averaged ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the variability of features from the P-wave time course before PAF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> has not been exploited yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work introduces a new alternative to assess time diversity of the P-wave features from single-lead ECG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the method is able to assess the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> 1 h before its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, which is a relevant advance in order to provide clinically useful PAF risk predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were in agreement with the electrophysiological changes taking place in the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, P-wave features presented an increasing variability as PAF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> approximates, thus suggesting intermittently disturbed conduction in the atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, high PAF risk prediction accuracy, greater than 90%, has been reached in the two considered scenarios, i.e. discrimination between healthy individuals and PAF patients and between patients far from PAF and close to PAF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, more long-term studies have to be analyzed and validated in future works </plain></SENT>
