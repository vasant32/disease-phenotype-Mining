<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unexpected induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the heart is still one of the major risks of new drugs despite recent improvements in cardiac safety assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we address this in a novel emerging assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven reference compounds were administrated to spontaneously beating clusters of cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CM) and the responses determined using multi-electrode arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine showed clear dose-dependence effects on field potential (FP) duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, the Ca(2+) channel blockers caused profound shortening of action potentials, whereas the classical hERG blockers, like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> and d,l-sotalol, induced prolongation, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, two potent blockers of the slow component of the delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(Ks)), HMR1556 and JNJ303, had only minor effects on the extracellular FP of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hPSC-CM despite evidence of functional I(Ks) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These compounds were therefore re-evaluated under conditions that mimicked reduced "repolarization reserve," a parameter reflecting the capacity of cardiomyocytes to repolarize and a strong risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, in both pharmacological and genetic models of diminished repolarization reserve, HMR1556 and JNJ03 strongly increased the FP duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These profound effects indicate that I(Ks) plays an important role in limiting action potential prolongation when repolarization reserve is attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings have important clinical implications and indicate that enhanced sensitization to repolarization-prolonging compounds through pharmacotherapy or genetic predisposition should be taken into account when assessing drug safety </plain></SENT>
