<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on QTcd is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two stable patients on maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each underwent two consecutive hemodialysis sessions at least 2 days apart, the first against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> dialysate (with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> at 1.8 mg/dL) followed by a low <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> dialysate (with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> at 0.6 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-dialysis weights, blood pressure, electrolytes, and 12-lead surface EKG were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QT interval and the QTcd were calculated before and after dialysis in both sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 16 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age ± SD was 53.7 ± 18.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean change of QTcd (pre- vs. post-dialysis) was 9.5 ms (p = 0.120) and 9.3 ms (p = 0.145) in low and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using univariate analysis, there was a statistically significant decrease in the mean blood pressure, weight, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, and QTc interval post-dialysis (compared to pre-dialysis) in both groups (p ≤ 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-dialysis concentrations of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium were unchanged (compared to pre-dialysis) but bicarbonate increased with both dialysate groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean change of QTcd was not significant pre- versus post-dialysis by univariate analysis in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis adjusting for pertinent factors did not change the results in either of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a low <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> dialysate bath in hemodynamically stable hemodialysis patients without preexisting advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> does not significantly impact QTcd </plain></SENT>
