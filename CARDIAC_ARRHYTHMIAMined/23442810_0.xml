<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> spreading from the anterior or posterior division of the left bundle branch is generally called fascicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (FT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We will present our experience with FT, a type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> not necessarily implying the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and/or sensitivity to selective antiarrhythmic drugs, but only particular routes of left ventricular depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1981 we have had the opportunity to study 10 cases of FT (nine men and one woman; aged 28-77 years, mean ± SD 55 ± 18.6 years) by means of echocardiography, coronary angiography (seven cases), endomyocardial biopsy (five cases), signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG, nine patients), electrophysiological and electropharmacological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients had paroxystic, extrastimulus inducible FT that was sensitive to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> given intravenously (group A); three patients, on the other hand, showed repetitive or incessant FT, not modifiable by stimulation techniques and sensitive to class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients presented histologic substrates ranging from the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> to previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FT spontaneously disappeared within 2 years in group B, while frequently persisted in the long term in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FT is not a homogeneous group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, as patients may differ according to clinical presentation, mechanisms that are involved in the genesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and natural history; the histologic substrate is highly variable, ranging from the total absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> to severe forms of myocardial involvement </plain></SENT>
