<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this Phase I, single-dose, randomized, 4-period crossover study, semagacestat was compared with placebo in 54 healthy male and female subjects between the ages of 19 and 63 years, inclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each study period included single oral-dose administrations of semagacestat 140 mg, semagacestat 280 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study subjects and the investigator were blinded to the identity of semagacestat and placebo; however, moxifloxacin was administered as open-label </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moxifloxacin was compared with placebo for assay sensitivity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic parameters were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For each QTc, the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the least squares mean difference between semagacestat (at both the 140- and 280-mg dose levels) and placebo was &lt; 10 msec at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points, and thus, within the limits set for clinical relevance in regulatory guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that single doses of 140 and 280 mg semagacestat did not prolong QTc to a clinically significant degree </plain></SENT>
