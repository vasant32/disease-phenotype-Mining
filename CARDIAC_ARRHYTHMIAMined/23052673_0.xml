<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in electroanatomical-mapping technologies have resulted in a decrease or complete elimination of fluoroscopy exposure during catheter ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of cryoablation of anteroseptal accessory pathways (APs) using electroanatomical-mapping system guidance with limited fluoroscopy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 patients underwent cryoablation of anteroseptal APs between July 2010 and April 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cryomapping was performed with a 6 mm-tip catheter at -30 °C before the lesions were delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An 8 mm-tip catheter was used in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EnSite system (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 11.9 ± 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success rate was 95.8 % (23 of 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure and cryoablation durations were 168 ± 58 min and 1,463 ± 525 s, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Limited fluoroscopy was used only in 7 patients, and the mean fluoroscopy time was 1.7 ± 1.8 min (range 0.1-4 min) in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was noted in 2 patients (8.7 %) who underwent a second successful cryoablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patient who underwent a failed attempt during the first procedure was successfully treated with a repeat procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The resultant long-term success rate was 100 % at a mean follow-up period of 14.2 ± 7.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no complications except for transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation of anteroseptal APs can be performed effectively and safely in children using a limited fluoroscopic approach with the help of electroanatomical-mapping systems </plain></SENT>
