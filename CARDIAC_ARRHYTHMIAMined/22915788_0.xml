<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Robotic catheter manipulation systems increase catheter tip stability which improves energy delivery and could produce more transmural lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested this assertion using bipolar voltage attenuation as a marker of lesion quality comparing robotic and manual circumferential pulmonary vein ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned to robotic or manual AF ablation at standard radiofrequency (RF) settings for our institution (30 W 60 s manual, 25 W 30 s robotic, R30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A separate group of 10 consecutive patients underwent robotic ablation at increased RF duration, 25 W for 60 s (R60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were marked on an electroanatomic map before and after ablation to measure distance moved and change in bipolar electrogram amplitude during RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 1108 lesions were studied (761 robotic, 347 manual) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A correlation was identified between voltage attenuation and catheter movement during RF (Spearman's rho -0.929, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ablation catheter was more stable during robotic RF; 2.9 ± 2.3 mm (R30) and 2.6 ± 2.2 mm (R60), both significantly less than the manual group (4.3 ± 3.0 mm, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite improved stability, there was no difference in signal attenuation between the manual and R30 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was increased signal attenuation in the R60 group (52.4 ± 19.4%) compared with manual (47.7 ± 25.4%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When procedures under general anaesthesia (GA) and conscious sedation were analysed separately, the improvement in signal attenuation in the R60 group was only significant in the procedures under GA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Robotically assisted ablation has the capability to deliver greater bipolar voltage attenuation compared with manual ablation with appropriate selection of RF parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>General anaesthesia confers additional benefits of catheter stability and greater signal attenuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings may have a significant impact on outcomes from AF ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
