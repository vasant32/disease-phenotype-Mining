<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic epicardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be targeted from the coronary venous system or the pericardial space, the endocardium, or the aortic sinus cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze systematically the contribution of ablation at sites other than the epicardium to eliminate an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> originating in the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a consecutive patient series of 33 patients (14 women, age 51 ± 14 years, ejection fraction 51% ± 9%) with epicardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, mapping and ablation was performed via the cardiac venous system/pericardial space, the aortic sinus cusp, and the left ventricular endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was defined as epicardial if the earliest <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of activation and a matching pace-map (≥10/12 leads) were identified in the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 12/33 patients (36%), either an endocardial approach alone (n = 3) or a combined endocardial/epicardial (n = 6), cusp/endocardial (n = 1), or cusp/epicardial (n = 2) approach was required to eliminate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 of 33 patients (30%), epicardial ablation alone was effective in eliminating epicardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation was ineffective due to failure to reach the site of origin with the ablation catheter in 5 of 33 patients (15%), the site of origin was too close to an epicardial artery or the phrenic nerve in 3 patients (6%), and power delivery was insufficient in 3 patients (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: About one-third of epicardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> require ablation from sites other than the epicardium to eliminate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> focus </plain></SENT>
