<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, 18 mongrel dogs were injected intravenously with ibutilide and the changes in heart rate, sinus node recovery time, and AVN were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data show that ibutilide administration caused significant suppression of the sinus atrial node, the peak response time was 20-30 min, and the heart rate was restored to pre-drug administration level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After receiving ibutilide, 1 animal had a 5 s sinus pause, and after 5 min of ibutilide administration, 1 dog showed 2:1 atrioventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was concluded that ibutilide had a suppressive effect on the sinoatrial node and AVN </plain></SENT>
