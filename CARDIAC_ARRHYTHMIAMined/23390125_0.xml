<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of apixaban versus aspirin on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in relation to the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk scores in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this secondary analysis of the AVERROES trial, our principal objective was to assess the effect of treatment with aspirin or apixaban on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, in relation to the CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for treatment efficacy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for apixaban when subdivided by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk strata, based on CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects were consistent irrespective of baseline risk, and thus, absolute benefits were greatest in the high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for apixaban versus aspirin with regard to major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, when subdivided by CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on aspirin were age â‰¥75 years, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min, and nonparoxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proportions of the study cohort classified as low/moderate/high risk using the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores were 0.3%/71.7%/28.1% and &lt;0.1%/10.5%/89.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> population, apixaban was superior to aspirin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, with similar rates of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, in the presence of one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, with consistency of the treatment effect by CHADS(2)/CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores </plain></SENT>
