<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The sinoatrial node is the main impulse-generating tissue in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular conduction block and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> caused by sinoatrial node dysfunction are clinically important and generally treated with electronic pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although an excellent solution, electronic pacemakers incorporate limitations that have stimulated research on biological pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the suitability of potential biological pacemakers, we tested the hypothesis that the spontaneous electric activity of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) exhibit beat rate variability and power-law behavior comparable to those of human sinoatrial node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We recorded extracellular electrograms from hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs under stable conditions for up to 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The beat rate time series of the spontaneous activity were examined in terms of their power spectral density and additional methods derived from nonlinear dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major findings were that the mean beat rate of hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs was stable throughout the 15-day follow-up period and was similar in both cell types, that hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs exhibited intrinsic beat rate variability and fractal behavior, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> increased and carbamylcholine decreased the beating rate in both hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs exhibit beat rate variability and power-law behavior as in humans, thus supporting the potential capability of these cell sources to serve as biological pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our ability to generate sinoatrial-compatible spontaneous cardiomyocytes from the patient's own hair (via keratinocyte-derived iPSCs), thus eliminating the critical need for immunosuppression, renders these myocytes an attractive cell source as biological pacemakers </plain></SENT>
