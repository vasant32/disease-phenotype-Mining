<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), contractile dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> result from disturbed intracellular Ca handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated stress kinases like cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which are known to influence many Ca-regulatory proteins, are mechanistically involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT ADVANCES: Beside classical activation pathways, it is becoming increasingly evident that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can directly oxidize these kinases, leading to alternative activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since HF is associated with increased ROS generation, ROS-activated serine/threonine kinases may play a crucial role in the disturbance of cellular Ca homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many of the previously described ROS effects on ion channels and transporters are possibly mediated by these stress kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For instance, ROS have been shown to oxidize and activate CaMKII, thereby increasing Na influx through voltage-gated Na channels, which can lead to intracellular Na accumulation and action potential prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, Ca entry via activated NCX is favored, which together with ROS-induced dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum can lead to dramatic intracellular Ca accumulation, diminished contractility, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CRITICAL ISSUES: While low amounts of ROS may regulate kinase activity, excessive uncontrolled ROS production may lead to direct redox modification of Ca handling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, depending on the source and amount of ROS generated, ROS could have very different effects on Ca-handling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The discrimination between fine-tuned ROS signaling and unspecific ROS damage may be crucial for the understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> development and important for the investigation of targeted treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
