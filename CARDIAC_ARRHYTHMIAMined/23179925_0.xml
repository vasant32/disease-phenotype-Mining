<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An effective ECG screening strategy for this population is intuitively appealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of ECG screening is to detect occult cardiovascular conditions likely to manifest with SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such an endeavor is only effective if it is highly sensitive with an acceptably low false-positive rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also must be accompanied by an intervention that reduces the risk of SCD and improves outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite significant advancements, considerable knowledge gaps remain about the etiology of SCD and the frequency with which SCD occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reports of screening programs that have reduced the incidence of SCD have limited generalizability based on program design and the populations studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the USA, considerable gaps in knowledge exist related to the frequency of SCD in youth and to the incremental predictive value of an ECG when added to a standardized history and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The strategy of ECG screening of young populations needs careful consideration based on principles of effective screening and evidence-based medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From a health policy perspective, additional data are needed from robust registries and carefully designed trials before advancing ECG screening in youth </plain></SENT>
