<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) may suffer incapacity as a result of device therapy itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review article was to examine the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that occur while driving, the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on driving as well as evidence to support that driving itself can precipitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We will also review the postulated mechanisms by which driving can precipitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we will compare guidelines from the USA, Europe, and UK in fitness to drive in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
