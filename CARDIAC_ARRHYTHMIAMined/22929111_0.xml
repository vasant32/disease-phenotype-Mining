<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review evaluates the mechanism of volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> as cardioprotective agents in both clinical and laboratory research and furthermore assesses possible cardiac side effects upon usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac as well as non-cardiac surgery may evoke perioperative adverse events including: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> have cardiovascular effects that can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, clinicians may choose to administer alternative <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, particularly if the patient has severe preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or cardiovascular instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasing preclinical evidence demonstrated that administration of inhaled <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> - before and during surgery - reduces the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury to the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, this preclinical data has been implemented clinically, and beneficial effects have been found in some studies of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of volatile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38870">anesthetic gases</z:chebi> was protective for patients undergoing cardiac surgery through manipulation of the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ATP (KATP) channel, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (mPTP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as through cytoprotective Akt and extracellular-signal kinases (ERK) pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies have demonstrated improved outcomes, the risks for undesirable hemodynamic effects must be weighed against the possible benefits of using volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> as a means to provide cardiac protection in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> who are undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
