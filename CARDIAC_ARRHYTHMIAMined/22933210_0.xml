<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of dominant frequency (DF) and organised index (OI) in outcomes of pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: OI and DF of electrograms in coronary vein (CS) during AF were obtained by frequency spectra analysis in 60 patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of 12 months follow up, 14 patients with recurrent AF were included in group 1 and 46 patients with sinus rhythm were included in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 1, no spectral component was reduced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectral components were reduced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation in 23 patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes of DF after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation was significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (1.2 ± 1.2 vs. 2.4 ± 1.3, p = 0.01); the increment of OI after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation in group 1 was significantly lower than in group 2 (9 ± 13% vs. 22 ± 17%, p = 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in DF and an increase in OI after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation may suggest a better clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
