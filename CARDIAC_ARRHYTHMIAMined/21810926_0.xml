<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: When <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) cannot be ruled out, emergency department (ED) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> are admitted for in-hospital observation because of the risk of complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A study was undertaken to compare the ability of three risk prediction models to identify patients at a very low risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 559 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> presenting to the ED and admitted for a suspicion of ACS were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predefined in-hospital complications were recorded and the risk predictions of the Global Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score, the Freedom-from-Events (FFE) risk score and the Goldman rule were compared using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 559 patients, 140 had ACS and 32 had at least one complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GRACE score was superior to the FFE score in predicting the risk of complications (area under ROC curve 0.76 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.85) vs 0.69 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.79), p=0.021) whereas the Goldman rule (area under ROC curve 0.60; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.72) was inferior to both the GRACE and FFE scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the GRACE score set to a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI 96% to 100%), 108 patients (19.3%) at almost no risk of complications could have been correctly identified in the ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GRACE and FFE scores are able to predict low complication risks in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> admitted for suspected ACS, but only the GRACE score may be able to identify a significant number of patients at almost no risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger multicentre study is needed to confirm the possibility of using the GRACE score to identify patients suitable for assessment without monitoring </plain></SENT>
