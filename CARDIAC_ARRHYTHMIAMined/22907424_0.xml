<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent technological advances in treatment, pharmacologic therapy remains the most common treatment modality for pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of antiarrhythmic agent, the duration of therapy, and the dosing schedule depend on multiple factors including the recurrence risk and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden (the latter being determined by the hemodynamic effect of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), and the frequency and duration of episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric medications, consideration must be given to the drug formulation, palatability, adverse effects and adherence issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are very few randomized trials available to guide the choice of therapy for pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and thus treatment options often reflect physician or institutional preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although various classification schemes exist, we classify antiarrhythmic agents based on their primary site of action: atrial muscle/accessory pathway (class IA, IC, and III agents); the atrioventricular node (beta-blockers, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>, digoxin, and class III agents); or ventricular muscle (class I and III agents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This type of categorization assists in the approach to treatment required for each type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> encountered </plain></SENT>
