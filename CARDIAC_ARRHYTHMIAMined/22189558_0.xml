<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tests the hypothesis that both Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate the effect of increased [Ca(2+)](i) to increase I(Na.L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole cell and open cell-attached patch clamp techniques were used to record I(Na.L) in rabbit ventricular myocytes dialyzed with solutions containing various concentrations of [Ca(2+)](i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dialysis of cells with [Ca(2+)](i) from 0.1 to 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 μM increased I(Na.L) in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.221 ± 0.038 to 0.554 ± 0.045 pA/pF (n = 10, P &lt; 0.01) and was associated with an increase in mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel open probability and prolongation of channel mean open-time (n = 7, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of 0.6 μM [Ca(2+)](i), KN-93 (10 μM) and bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, 2 μM) decreased I(Na.L) by 45.2 and 54.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of KN-93 and autocamtide-2-related inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> II (2 μM) were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combination of KN-93 and BIM completely reversed the increase in I(Na.L) as well as the Ca(2+)-induced changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel mean open probability and mean open-time induced by 0.6 μM [Ca(2+)](i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">Phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25456">myristoyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> increased I(Na.L) in myocytes dialyzed with 0.1 μM [Ca(2+)](i); the effect was abolished by Gö-6976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, both CaMKII and PKC are involved in [Ca(2+)](i)-mediated augmentation of I(Na.L) in ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of CaMKII and/or PKC pathways may be a therapeutic target to reduce myocardial dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> caused by calcium overload </plain></SENT>
