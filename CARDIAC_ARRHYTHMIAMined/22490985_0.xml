<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of Brugada and a short QT phenotype resulting from mutation in SCN5A has not previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A man with concomitant Brugada-like and short QT electrocardiogram (ECG) was identified and the SCN5A gene was sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch clamp analysis of human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing a SCN5A channel with the patient's sequence was used to investigate the biophysical properties of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with the family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> showed Brugada-like and short QT interval ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the coding region of the SCN5A gene, identified a G to A heterozygous missense mutation at nucleotide site 2066 that resulted in a amino-acid substitution of arginine to histidine at amino-acid site 689 (R689H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp analysis showed that the R689H failed to generate current when heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, indicating it was a loss-of-function mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our finding firstly shows that a heterozygous missense mutation R689H in SCN5A gene results in the loss of protein function and the coexistents of the Brugada-like and short QT interval ECG phenotypes </plain></SENT>
