<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ANS may be programmed during pregnancy due to various maternal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to study maternal prenatal psychosocial stress as a potential disruptor of cardiac ANS balance in the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mothers from a prospective birth cohort (ABCD study) filled out a questionnaire at gestational week 16 [IQR 12-20], that included validated instruments for state <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, depressive symptoms, pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, parenting daily hassles and job strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cumulative stress score was also calculated (based on 80(th) percentiles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indicators of cardiac ANS in the offspring at age 5-6 years are: pre-ejection period (PEP), heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and cardiac autonomic balance (CAB), measured with electrocardiography and impedance cardiography in resting supine and sitting positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2,624 mother-child pairs, only single births, were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stress scales were not significantly associated with HR, PEP, RSA and CAB (p≥0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accumulation of maternal stress was also not associated with HR, PEP, RSA and CAB (p≥0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results did not support the hypothesis that prenatal maternal psychosocial stress deregulates cardiac ANS balance in the offspring, at least in rest, and at the age of five-six years </plain></SENT>
