<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: An electroanatomic mapping system using an electromagnetic navigation technology constructs a 3-dimensional structure of the heart with high geometric accuracy of the data that provides a precise localization of the substrates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The system was tested for the feasibility and efficacy in intraoperative mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION: The strength of the magnetic field is measured by a location sensor with three different frequencies generated by a location pad placed beneath the operating table, and the spatial location of the sensor is determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By roving the catheter on the heart while the local electrogram is recorded simultaneously, the 3-dimensional figure of the heart is reconstructed and an activation or voltage map is generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EVALUATION: The system was used in 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The focus or reentrant circuit of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was precisely located and a map-guided procedure was successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass allowed for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> to be mapped without any hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative mapping using the electroanatomic mapping system enables a precise localization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> substrate </plain></SENT>
