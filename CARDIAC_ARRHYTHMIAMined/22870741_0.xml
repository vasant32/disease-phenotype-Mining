<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to examine the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, a beta adrenergic receptor blocker, on cardiac electrophysiological stability of male goats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen male goats were randomly divided into three groups: (i) control animals (n=5), (ii) a compound stimuli group including noise and red flash (n=5), (iii) and a compound stimuli group with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> were determined by using high performance chromatography with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate turbulence (HRT) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analysed with the MGY-H12L analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> threshold (VFT) and the ventricular vulnerable period (VVP) were determined by programmed S1S2 stimulus with bipolar electrodes at the apex of the goat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compound stimuli increased plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels progressively and decreased the negative value of turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO), turbulence slope (TS), SDNN, PNN50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compound stimuli broadened VVP and decreased VFT significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment failed to affect plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels, TS and PNN50 value of the compound stimuli group, it significantly increased the negative value of TO, SDNN, VFT and narrowed VVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates that compound stimuli can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stressful reactions, and decrease the cardiac electrophysiological stability of male goats, which can be counteracted by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
