<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Several drugs blocking the rapidly activating <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(r)) channel cause malformations (including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath>) and embryonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in animal teratology studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, these drugs have an established risk for acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, associations between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> have been reported for drugs widely used in pregnancy (e.g. antidepressants), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether a common embryonic adverse-effect mechanism exists in the human, rat, and rabbit embryos, we made a comparative study of embryonic cardiomyocytes from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patch-clamp and quantitative-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> measurements of K(r) and slowly activating K (K(s)) channels were performed on human, rat, and rabbit primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac samples from different embryo-foetal stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The K(r) channel was present when the heart started to beat in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species, but was, in contrast to human and rabbit, lost in rats in late organogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specific K(r)-channel blocker E-4031 prolonged the action potential in a species- and development-dependent fashion, consistent with the observed K(r)-channel expression pattern and reported sensitive periods of developmental toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>E-4031 also increased the QT interval and induced 2:1 atrio-ventricular block in multi-electrode array electrographic recordings of rat embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The K(s) channel was expressed in human and rat throughout the embryo-foetal period but not in rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This first comparison of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents, and action-potential characteristics, with and without a specific K(r)-channel blocker in human, rat, and rabbit embryos provides evidence of K(r)-channel inhibition as a common mechanism for embryonic malformations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
