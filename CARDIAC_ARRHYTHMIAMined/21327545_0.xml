<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We show that puerarin effectively prevents and reverses <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in perfused heart in vitro and in rats in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the mechanisms of antiarrhythmic action of puerarin, we investigated the electrophysiological actions of puerarin using whole-cell clamp in isolated rodent ventricular myocytes and two electrode voltage-clamp (TEV) in I(K1)-expressing Xenopus oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Puerarin had no prominent effect on action potentials of ventricular myocytes from guinea pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, puerarin (1.2 mM) significantly inhibited the I(K1) current in rat ventricular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, puerarin blocked I(K1) expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Puerarin competed with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi>, an open-channel blocker of I(K1), to inhibit I(K1) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data demonstrated that puerarin is a novel open-channel blocker of I(K1), which may underlie the antiarrhythmic action of puerarin </plain></SENT>
