<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective population based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 98 maternity units in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women delivering in The Netherlands between August 2004 and August 2006 (n = 371,021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of severe maternal morbidity and mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were prospectively collected during a two-year period in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with cardiovascular complications during pregnancy or postpartum who were admitted to the ward, intensive care or coronary care unit were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, valvular disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women delivering in the same period served as a reference cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, case fatality rates and possible risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Incidence of severe maternal morbidity due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was 2.3 per 10,000 deliveries (84/358,874) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maternal mortality rate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was 3.0 per 100,000 deliveries (11/358,874) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Case fatality rate in women with severe maternal morbidity due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was 13% (11/84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Case fatality rate was highest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing acquired or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was identified in 34% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one percent of women were of advanced maternal age (&gt;35 years of age) and 5 percent above 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Possible risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> were caesarean section (either resulting in or as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>), multiple pregnancy, prior caesarean section, non-Western ethnicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In The Netherlands <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> is a rare cause of severe maternal morbidity with an incidence of 2.3 per 10,000 deliveries and a high case fatality rate of 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular complications develop mostly in women not known with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> pre-pregnancy </plain></SENT>
