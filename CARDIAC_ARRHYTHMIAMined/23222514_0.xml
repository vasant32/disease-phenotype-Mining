<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence based largely on US cohorts suggests that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter is associated with cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is less evidence for other pollutants and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a cohort of 836,557 patients age 40 to 89 years registered with 205 English general practices in 2003, we investigated relationships between ambient outdoor air pollution and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Events were identified from primary care records, hospital admissions, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual average concentrations in 2002 for particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 (PM10) and &lt;2.5 microns, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="33101">nitrogen dioxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi>), ozone, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18422">sulfur dioxide</z:chebi> at a 1 × 1 km resolution were derived from emission-based models and linked to residential postcode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for relevant confounders, including social and economic deprivation and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While evidence was weak for relationships with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, we found consistent associations between pollutant concentrations and incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An interquartile range change in PM10 and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16301">NO2 </z:chebi>(3.0 and 10.7 µg/m, respectively) both produced a hazard ratio of 1.06 (95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.11) after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was some evidence that these effects were greater in more affluent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study of an English national cohort found evidence linking long-term exposure to particulate matter and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi> with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not, however, replicate associations for other cardiovascular outcomes that have been reported elsewhere </plain></SENT>
