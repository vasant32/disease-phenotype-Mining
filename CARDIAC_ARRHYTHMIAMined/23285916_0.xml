<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The data of patients injected with Shenmai is analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This information is collected from HIS in twenty hospitals of grade III-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many indexes are included such as age, sex, occupation, admission condition, hospitalization days, critical days, diagnosis of traditional and western medicine, dosage of drug, route of administration, drug combination and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The age of patients between 46 and 65 is the most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hospitalization day between 15 and 28 is the most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Shenmai injection is more used for such diseases as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>About 97.55% of route of administration in medical order are consistent with specification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main combination drugs of Shenmai injection are analyzed for adjuvant therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, shock and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Shenmai injection, as a traditional Chinese medicine injection, has the advantages of extensive indication and is used widely in clinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The researching result based on HIS is objective and real </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It can be referenced by researchers and clinician </plain></SENT>
