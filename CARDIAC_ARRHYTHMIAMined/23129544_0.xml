<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the concept of visually guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been established little is known on energy titration using laser ablation.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 60 patients with AF, PVI using the endoscopic ablation system (EAS) was performed in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visually guided ablation was carried out after obtaining optimal tissue contact with 5.5-8.5 W in the LD group and with &gt;8.5 W in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> PVI after a single visually guided circular lesion set was achieved in 89% (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and 69% (LD), respectively, (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More energy was deployed (6483 ± 1834 vs. 5306 ± 2258 Ws; P ≤ 0.0001) with less applications (31.6 ± 8 vs. 35.2 ± 15 applications per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>; P = 0.03) leading to shorter procedure times (128 ± 17 vs. 154 ± 38 min; P = 0.001).During median follow-up of 311 days (261-346) recurrence rate was 17 and 40% in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and LD group, respectively </plain></SENT>
