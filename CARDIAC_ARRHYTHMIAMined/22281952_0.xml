<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a prospective design, we studied 4657 older men and women (mean age, 75 years) from the Cardiovascular Health Study (1992-2006) to evaluate the association between plasma NEFA and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of NEFA were measured using established enzymatic methods, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was adjudicated using medical records, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, proxy interview, and autopsy reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate multivariable-adjusted relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 10.0 years, 221 new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable model adjusting for age, sex, race, clinic site, alcohol intake, smoking, prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and self-reported health status, relative risks (95% confidence interval) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> were 1.0 (ref), 1.15 (0.81-1.64), 1.06 (0.72-1.55), and 0.91 (0.60-1.38) across consecutive quartiles of NEFA concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In secondary analyses restricted to the first 5 years of follow-up, we also did not observe a statistically significant association between plasma NEFA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not provide evidence for an association between plasma NEFA measured late in life and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in older adults </plain></SENT>
