<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Describe the initial experience of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia in the surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> using bipolar radiofrequency device in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, reporting the results of postoperative follow-up of one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2008 and March 2009, 47 consecutive patients (36 women), with mean age of 53.7 Â± 10.6 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> for a mean period of 34.6 months (3-192 months) underwent surgical ablation of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, through bipolar radiofrequency during the procedure which led to the indication of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of them showed intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 39, continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one percent underwent valve surgery as the main procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a one-year postoperative retrospective, observational evaluation of clinical variables and 24-h Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of the 47 patients, 40 survived one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 33 underwent 24 h Holter, at an average interval of 401 days after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following rhythm distribution was found: 24 (73.0%) sinus, five (15.0%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, three (9.0%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial Flutter</z:hpo> and one (3.0%) junctional rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> were observed, one of which was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with bipolar radiofrequency device concomitant with cardiac surgery is an effective method for treating this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
