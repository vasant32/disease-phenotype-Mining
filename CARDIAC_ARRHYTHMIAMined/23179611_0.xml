<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arterial baroreflex is important for haemodynamic stability and for cardioprotection, and it has convincingly been demonstrated that baroreflex sensitivity, even when assessed with different methods, has a strong prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Development of new baroreflex assessing procedures is still ongoing, with a focus on increased reliability in difficult measuring circumstances, e.g., in patients with a weak baroreflex and in patients with frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
