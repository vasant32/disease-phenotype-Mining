<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of a cardiac clinical information system is to achieve the best possible diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> by electronic data processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac information system that is designed to offer remote monitoring of patient who needed continues follow up is demanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, intra- and interpatient electrocardiogram (ECG) morphological descriptors are varying through the time as well as the computational limits pose significant challenges for practical implementations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former requires that the classification model be adjusted continuously, and the latter requires a reduction in the number and types of ECG features, and thus, the computational burden, necessary to classify different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose the use of adaptive learning to automatically train the classifier on up-to-date ECG data, and employ adaptive feature selection to define unique feature subsets pertinent to different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experimental results show that this hybrid technique outperforms conventional approaches and is, therefore, a promising new intelligent diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
