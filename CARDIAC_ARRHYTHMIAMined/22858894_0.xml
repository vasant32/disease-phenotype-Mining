<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Three-dimensional (3D) mapping has been established for clinical routine in an interventional electrophysiology (EP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel sensor-based 3D catheter tracking system has been introduced integrating 3D non-fluoroscopic catheter navigation into the environment of pre-recorded 2D fluoroscopy [MediGuide™ Technology (MG)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We are reporting on the first clinical experience for ablation of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First we aimed to demonstrate safety and feasibility of this new technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, procedural aspects such as effectiveness, procedure, and fluoroscopy time should be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (100% male, age 68 ± 8 years) were ablated using MG technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two steerable diagnostic EP catheters (MediGuide Enabled Livewire™ Catheter, SJM) were used for coronary sinus cannulation and anatomical cavo-tricuspidal isthmus (CTI) reconstruction within the EnSite NavX™ System (NavX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed with a conventional 8 mm tip ablation catheter (IBI, SJM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients both sensor-equipped MG catheters could be tracked non-fluoroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Successful anatomical CTI reconstruction was performed and complete isthmus block was documented after the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total procedure duration was comparable with conventional procedures (55 ± 8 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Usage of the MG tracking system resulted in a fluoroscopy time of 2.5 ± 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No adverse events occurred during the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first clinical application of the MG technology in an interventional electrophysiology we found a stable system enabling excellent 3D orientation for spatial catheter positioning on the basis of underlying pre-recorded cine loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the MG technology allowed successful procedures with short fluoroscopy times, even though a sensor-equipped ablation catheter was not yet available for use in the study </plain></SENT>
