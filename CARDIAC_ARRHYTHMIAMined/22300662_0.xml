<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is a disorder involving diseased cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a membrane-associated protein important to cardiomyocyte homeostasis and is downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that BIN1 could be released into the circulation and that blood-available BIN1 can provide useful data on the cardiac status of patients whose hearts are failing secondary to ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma BIN1 levels can be used to measure disease severity in patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 24 patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma BIN1 levels were assessed for their ability to correlate with cardiac functional status and predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean plasma BIN1 levels were decreased in patients with ARVC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (15 ± 7 vs 60 ± 17 in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, P &lt;.05; the plasma BIN1 level was 60 ± 10 in non-ARVC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BIN1 levels correlated inversely with number of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (R = -.47; P &lt;.05), and low BIN1 levels correctly classified patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (receiver operator curve area under the curve of 0.88 ± 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low BIN1 levels also predicted future <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (receiver operator curve area under the curve of 0.89 ± 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a stratified analysis, BIN1 levels could predict future <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients without severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (n = 20) with an accuracy of 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the 7 patients with ARVC with serial blood samples, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had evidence of disease progression during follow-up, plasma BIN1 levels decreased significantly (a decrease of 63%; P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BIN1 level seems to correlate with cardiac functional status and the presence or absence of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a small cohort of patients with ARVC and can predict future <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
