<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of procedure-related complications have been reported, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, but serious cardiac complications are relatively less mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a uremic woman with preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> who required emergent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and received jugular double-lumen CVC insertion, which was complicated by short-duration <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> followed by complete atrio-ventricular block and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological management did not reverse heart rate and rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>External pacing was not applied because she remained hemodynamically stable in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate returned to sinus rhythm with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> 4 hours later and did not recur through the whole admission period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> might have been induced by mechanical contact with the ventricular wall during the procedure with the guided metallic wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, physicians responsible for CVC catheterization should pay more attention to patients with preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> to prevent such technical mistakes from transpiring </plain></SENT>
