<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The most important criterion in the management of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> is the delineation of the injury pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate in a retrospective manner the patients who undergo surgery due to ERCP-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2010, a total of 9209 ERCPs were performed at Turkiye Yuksek Ihtisas Teaching and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was diagnosed in 52 patients (0.56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (46.2%) underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated according to age, gender, ERCP indication, comorbid disease, the time between diagnosis and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, the time between ERCP and surgical intervention, radiological and clinical signs, localization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, surgical procedure, hospitalization period, and postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (54.1%) had lateral duodenal wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, 4 patients (16.7%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in the afferent loop (these patients had Billroth-II gastroenterostomy at ERCP admission), 2 patients (8.3%) had bile duct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and 1 patient (4.1%) had esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients (16.7%), the localization of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> could not be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (37.5%) died in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients had lateral duodenal wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, 2 patients had afferent loop <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and one patient had esophagus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients died of nonsurgical reasons (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, serebrovascular occlusion, and cardiac dysrhythmia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Duodenal wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> have a serious fatal outcome even if early surgical intervention is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast to duodenal wall injuries, perivaterian and choledochal injuries have a better outcome </plain></SENT>
