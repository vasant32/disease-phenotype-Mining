<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most frequent sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of elderly patients, in whom it determines an increase in morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim of this study was to assess age-related differences in the characteristics, management and prognosis of patients with AF in European cardiology practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Euro Heart Survey on AF was an observational study sponsored by the European Society of Cardiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled between 2003 and 2004 in 182 hospitals of 35 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purposes of this study, they were categorized into three age-groups: &lt;65 (n=2124), 65-80 (n=2534) and &gt;80 years (n=671) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was closed in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with general population estimates, patients &gt;80 years were underrepresented in the Euro Heart Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The oldest patients were less likely to be enrolled by university or specialized centers, to receive extensive diagnostic testing, and to receive oral anticoagulation despite a worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the oldest patients less often received rhythm control therapy, even when presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and non-permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 1 year follow-up, elderly patients more often suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They had higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with AF are less often referred to the cardiologist and, based on current guidelines, are inadequately studied and treated, compared to younger counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Education on evidence- based management and the design of randomized controlled trials specifically targeting the elderly, should improve the management and prognosis of this frail segment of the AF population </plain></SENT>
