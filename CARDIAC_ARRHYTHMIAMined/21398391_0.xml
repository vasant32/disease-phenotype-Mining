<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous experiments demonstrated that mono-N-desethylamiodarone (MDEA) was the major circulating metabolite in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, dealkylation, hydroxylation, and deamination were minor metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the metabolites of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in the bile obtained from patients with T-tube drainage after oral drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> metabolism in vitro was also investigated using human liver microsomes (HLMs) and S9 fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF MS) revealed 33 metabolites in human bile, including 22 phase I and 11 phase II metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major metabolites were MDEA (M7) and ω-carboxylate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (M12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metabolite M12 was isolated from human bile, and the chemical structure was confirmed using UPLC-Q/TOF MS and ¹H NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authentic standards of two hydroxylated metabolites, 2-hydroxylamiodarone and 3'-hydroxylamiodarone, were obtained through microbial transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several novel metabolic pathways of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in human were proposed, including ω-carboxylation, deiodination, and glucuronidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in vitro study demonstrated that incubation of HLMs with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> did not give rise to any carboxyl metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, M12 and its metabolites were detected in human liver S9 incubation samples, and the production of these metabolites were inhibited almost completely by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5141">4-methylpyrazole</z:chebi>, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, suggesting the involvement of alcohol dehydrogenase in the ω-carboxylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, UPLC-Q/TOF MS analysis leads to the discovery of several novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> metabolites in human bile and underscores the importance of bile as an excretion pathway </plain></SENT>
