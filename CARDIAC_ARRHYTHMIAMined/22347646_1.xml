<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia is an essential element of experimental medical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ketamine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> are agents commonly used to induce and maintain anesthesia in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular effects of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> are diverse, and the response of global myocardial function is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a series of 15 swine, echocardiography measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were obtained before the animals received anesthesia (baseline), after an intramuscular injection of ketamine (postketamine) and after inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (postisoflurane) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean LVEF of an unanesthetized swine was 47 ± 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in the mean LVEF after administration of ketamine to 41 + 6.5% (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> did not result in further decrease in mean LVEF (mean LVEF 38 ± 7.2%, P = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight of the swine had an increase in their LVEF with sympathetic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our experimental model the administration of ketamine was associated with decreased LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The decrease may be largely secondary to a blunting of sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> to ketamine did not significantly change LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A significant number of animals had returned to preanesthesia LV function with sympathetic stimulation </plain></SENT>
