<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Laparoscopic technique is now well established for ventral/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However several issues such as optimal fixation technique, occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo>, management of inadvertent enterotomies, postoperative seromas and recurrence require appraisal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single centre retrospective review of 1,242 patients between January 1992 and June 2005 is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had laparoscopic ventral/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> repair (LVIHR) following a standardised protocol by five consultants and fellows in a dedicated minimal access surgery unit of a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LVIHR was completed in 1,223 patients (98.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average BMI was 32, mean defect size was 26.2 cm(2), mean operating time was 81 min and mean hospital stay was 1.9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean mesh to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo> ratio was 37.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> were observed in 203 (16.3%) patients and inadvertent enterotomies occurred in 21 (1.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality occurred in two patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmia being the respective reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common sequel was early seroma formation (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> pain occurred in 14.7% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rate was 4.4%, which was associated with a higher BMI, use of staplers as fixation device, multiple defects and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up was 5.4 years; (range 2.4-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The follow up rate was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LVIHR leads to low recurrence rates and low rates of wound and mesh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> are diagnosed and optimally treated laparoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain remains an unresolved issue </plain></SENT>
