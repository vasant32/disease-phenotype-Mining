<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Noncontact mapping is useful for the diagnosis of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Virtual unipolar electrogram <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> (VUEM) of the conduction block and the turnaround points, however, are not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the VUEM characteristics of a transverse conduction block in the posterior right atrium (RA) with those of contact bipolar electrograms obtained during typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contact bipolar electrograms were used to map the posterior RA during typical AFL in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty points of the VUEM recorded along the block line were analyzed and compared with contact bipolar electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen AFLs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen AFLs showed an incomplete transverse conduction block in the posterior RA by contact bipolar mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A double potential on the block line corresponded to the two components of the VUEM, in which the second component showed an Rs, RS, or rS pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the turnaround point, a fused double potential of the contact bipolar electrograms corresponded to a change of the second component of the VUEM from an rS to a QS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two AFLs showed a complete block line in the posterior RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The contact bipolar electrogram showed double potentials from the inferior vena cava to the superior vena cava, whereas the second component of the VUEM remained in an unchanged Rs, RS, or rS pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VUEM analysis was a reliable method for identifying the posterior block line during AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This method may also be applicable for detecting block lines and turnaround points of circuits in other unmappable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
