<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the (i) incidence of loss of capture and infectious complications and (ii) 1-year clinical outcomes of 402 CRT-D and CRT-P recipients enrolled in the MASCOT study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The indications for CRT-D or CRT-P were posed by the implanting physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> (i) losses of atrial and right and left ventricular capture, (ii) system-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and (iii) clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes, were recorded up to 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator was implanted in 228 (57%) and CRT-P in 174 (43%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of loss of capture was greater in CRT-D with 21 patients (9.2%) than in CRT-P with 6 patient (3.5%) recipients (P = 0.01), while the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates were 1.3% (3 patients) and 1.2% (2 patients), respectively (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CRT-D group, 42 of 228 patients (18.4%) died or were hospitalized for HF, compared with 38 of 174 patients (21.8%) in the CRT-P group (ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the CRT-D group, 23 patients (10.1%) were hospitalized for worsening HF and 20 (8.8%) patients died, vs. 22 (12.6%) and 19 (10.9%) patients, respectively, in the CRT-P group (ns for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator was implanted in 57% of candidates for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 1 year after device implant, the incidence of loss of capture at any lead was nearly three-fold greater among CRT-D than among CRT-P recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>System-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were infrequent and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
