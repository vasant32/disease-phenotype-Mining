<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Around 1900, a few clinical researchers were dealing with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> with the use of arterial and venous pulse tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sir James Mackenzie, who has been one of the fathers of modern cardiology, introduced registration of the venous pulse at the bedside using the clinical polygraph he had invented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He applied the results of his experimental and clinical discoveries to the explanation of many kinds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> before ECG introduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our paper, we have especially considered the three steps of his approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the first two developed in the pre-ECG era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The invention of an instrument of precision, the electrocardiograph, revolutionized the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and catalyzed the formation of cardiology as a specialty </plain></SENT>
