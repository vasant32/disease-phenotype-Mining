<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used the targeted toxin, leptin conjugated to saporin (Lep-SAP), to examine the importance of leptin receptor-B (LepR-B)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) for generation of circadian feeding rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats given Arc Lep-SAP injections were initially hyperphagic and rapidly became <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (the "dynamic phase" of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During this phase, Lep-SAP rats were arrhythmic under 12:12-h light-dark (LD) conditions, consuming 59% of their total daily intake during the daytime, compared with 36% in blank-SAP (B-SAP) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lep-SAP rats were also arrhythmic in continuous dark (DD), while significant circadian feeding rhythms were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B-SAP controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 8 wk after injection, Lep-SAP rats remained <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> but transitioned into a "static phase" of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> marked by attenuation of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> and rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this phase, Arc Lep-SAP rats exhibited circadian feeding rhythms under LD conditions, but were arrhythmic in continuous light (LL) and DD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lep-SAP injections into the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, or arrhythmic feeding in either LD or DD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrolytic lesion of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> produced feeding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in DD but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that both Arc Lep-SAP neurons and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> are required for generation of feeding rhythms entrained to photic cues, while also revealing an essential role for the Arc in maintaining circadian rhythms of ad libitum feeding independent of light entrainment </plain></SENT>
