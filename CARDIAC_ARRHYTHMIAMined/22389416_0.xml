<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) are efficient in reducing mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-rate cut-off programming may be effective in reducing appropriate and inappropriate therapies, but as the long-term consequences on morbidity and mortality remain unclear, it is underutilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively studied 365 consecutive patients (mean age 60 ± 10 years), with ischaemic (63%) or non-ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 25 ± 7%), who were implanted with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (41% single chamber, 31% dual chamber, and 28% biventricular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> devices were programmed with a shock-only zone over 220 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and a monitoring zone between 170 and 220 b.p.m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 40 months, 41 patients received appropriate shocks (11.2%) and 24 inappropriate shocks (6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, 306 patients never experienced any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate discharges were related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmia</z:hpo> in 10 patients, and noise/oversensing in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> episodes, sustained or not, were recorded in the monitoring zone in 43 patients (11.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven of these patients were symptomatic (1.9%), without lethal consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients (17%) died: 35 from end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 1 from unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, and 26 from a documented non-cardiac cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-rate cut-off (220 b.p.m.) shock-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> programming, in primary prevention patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, appeared to be safe during a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It also resulted in a very low rate of discharges, which are known to be deleterious in this population </plain></SENT>
