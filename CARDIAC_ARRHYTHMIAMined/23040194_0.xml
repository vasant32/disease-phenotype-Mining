<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine whether a minimally invasive approach to isolated valve surgery reduced the incidence of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, who underwent isolated aortic or mitral valve surgery between January 2005 and August 2011, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative AF in those who underwent a minimally invasive approach was compared with that of patients undergoing median sternotomy surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resource utilization was approximated on the basis of intensive care unit and total hospital lengths of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 571 patients were identified (413 minimally invasive and 158 median sternotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in baseline characteristics existed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative AF (25% vs 37%; P = .002), use of intraoperative blood products (52% vs 83%; P &lt; .001), and prolonged intubation (≥24 hours) (12% vs 20%; P = .008) were significantly less in the minimally invasive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 45 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 28-66 hours) versus 53 hours (IQR, 45-91 hours) (P &lt; .001), and 5 days (IQR, 4-7 days) versus 8 days (IQR, 6-11 days) (P &lt; .001) for the minimally invasive and median sternotomy groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis revealed a decreased risk of postoperative AF in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence intervals, 0.24-0.66; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A minimally invasive approach for isolated valve surgery reduces postoperative AF and resource use when compared with median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
