<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Level I trauma center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred six patients with pertrochanteric femur fracture (OTA classification: 31-B1, 31-B2, 31-B3, 31-A1, 31-A2, 31-B3, 32-A1, and 32-A2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A multidisciplinary, collaborative model of perioperative care: the Medical Orthopaedic Trauma Service (MOTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of in-patient complications, length of in-patient hospitalization, readmission rate after hospital discharge, and postdischarge mortality at 90 days and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there was no change in length of hospitalization, there was a significantly decreased overall incidence of in-patient complications and a decreased incidences of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the MOTS cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences persisted after controlling for age, comorbidity, gender, ethnicity, type of fracture, and number of days from admission to surgery with a logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis of patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of 1 or 2 revealed a significantly decreased 90 day readmission rate with the MOTS model, but this did not persist in a regression model (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary, collaborative model of care for patients with hip fractures decreases the incidence of postoperative in-patient complications and may influence hospital readmission rates </plain></SENT>
