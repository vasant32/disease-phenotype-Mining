<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate repolarization sequence, monophasic action potentials were recorded from a mean of 153 ± 54 left and right ventricular epicardial and endocardial sites in 10 pigs using the CARTO mapping system (Biosense Webster, Waterloo, Belgium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation time and end-of-repolarization (EOR) time were measured and 3-dimensional maps of activation and repolarization sequences constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 8 of 9 pigs, both the activation and EOR times appeared first in the septum and last in the latero-basal areas on the endocardium, not on the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EOR followed the activation sequence, both on the epicardium (in 8/9 pigs) and endocardium (in 8/8 pigs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal EOR differences were 84 ± 20 ms, whereas the local EOR differences between paired sites against each other on the left ventricular epicardium and endocardium were 11 ± 9 ms in the apex and 12 ± 12 ms in the anterior wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The EOR follows the activation sequence both on the epicardium and endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apico-basal gradients are predominant repolarization gradients, as compared with the epicardial-endocardial gradients </plain></SENT>
