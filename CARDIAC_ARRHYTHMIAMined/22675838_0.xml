<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) and increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is controversial, and data on this subject are meager </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate QT variability index (QTVI) and other repolarization markers associated with arrhythmogenity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 12 FMF patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and 14 age and gender-matched healthy subjects served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QT measurements were conducted according to accepted procedure, using computerized software for recording and analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences were found in clinical and demographic parameters in the study and control groups, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> which was more common in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QTc and power spectral analysis of QT variability parameters were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, QTVI values in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> patients were significantly higher than in healthy individuals (-1.02 +/- 0.38, vs. -1.36 +/- 0.32 respectively, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with healthy controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> is associated with increased QTVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown whether this finding is solely <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> related and whether it has any prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
