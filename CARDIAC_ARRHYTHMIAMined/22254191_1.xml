<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> characterized by increased interstitial collagen accumulation and increased myofibroblast proliferation also promotes enhanced automaticity and early afterdepolarizations (EADs) causing triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>Fibrosis</z:mp> then becomes an effective therapeutic target for the management of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) is shown to readily promote EADs and triggered activity in isolated rat and rabbit ventricular myocytes however, this same stress fails to cause EADs in well-coupled, non-fibrotic hearts due to source-to-sink mismatches arising from cell-to-cell coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The triggered activity in the aged fibrotic hearts causes focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) that degenerates within seconds to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) after the emergence of spatially discordant action potential duration alternans leading to wavebreak, reentry and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations in 2D tissue incorporating variable degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> showed that intermediate (but not mild or very severe) <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> promoted EADs and TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human studies have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> was an independent predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> including sustained VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A variety of drug classes including, torsemide, a loop <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi>, that inhibits the enzyme involved in the myocardial extracellular generation of collagen type I molecules and the inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> system (RAAS), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptors and endothelin receptors reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> with reduction of myocardial stiffness and improved ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that in the near future effective antifibrotic drug regimen would be developed to reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> related VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
