<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (RT 3D TEE) is a novel technology, which permits detailed visualization of cardiac structures in a 3D perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility, advantages, and safety of RT 3D TEE in guiding CBA in a series of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>.METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five patients (34 males, mean age: 63 ± 12 years) underwent CBA guided by 3D TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 190 veins could be documented by TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography successfully guided the operator to position the CB in the pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) ostium and obtain complete occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 190 (100%) veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography identified leakages in 25 (13%) veins led to successful elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-left atrium (LA) backflow by guiding correct balloon repositioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four (2%) veins, this imaging tool led to perform successful pull-down manoeuvres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean 2.6 ± 1.4 applications, isolation could be documented in 190 (100%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median procedural and fluoroscopy times were 145 and 24 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 278 days, 37 (82%) patients did not experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence following a 3-month blanking period.CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation is safe and feasible under RT 3D TEE guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This imaging tool permits perfect visualization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia and neighbouring LA structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, it proved very efficient in guiding the operator to achieve complete occlusion and successful isolation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> veins </plain></SENT>
