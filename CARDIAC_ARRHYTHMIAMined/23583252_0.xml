<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a therapeutic alternative for patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> at high or prohibitive surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, patients undergoing TAVI are also at high risk for both <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> complications, and specific mechanical aspects of the procedure itself can increase the risk of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of periprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications seem to relate mainly to vascular/access site complications (related to the use of large catheters in a very old and frail elderly population), whereas the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular events remains largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, although mechanical complications, especially the interaction between the valve prosthesis and the native aortic valve, play a major role in events that occur during TAVI, postprocedural events might also be related to a prothrombotic environment or state generated by the implanted valve, the occurrence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and associated comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic therapy in the setting of TAVI has been empirically determined, and unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure followed by dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (indefinitely) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (1-6 months) is the most commonly recommended treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and cerebrovascular events are common; these may be modifiable with optimization of peri- and post-procedural pharmacology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, as the field of antiplatelet and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy evolves, potential drug combinations will multiply, introducing variability in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials are the best path forward to determine to determine the balance between the efficacy and risks of antithrombotic treatment in this high risk population </plain></SENT>
