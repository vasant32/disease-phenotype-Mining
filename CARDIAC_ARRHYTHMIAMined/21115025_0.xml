<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the effects of PhKv, a 4584 Da <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> isolated from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer venom, in the isolated rat heart and in isolated ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 15 min followed by 30 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of native PhKv (240 nM) 1 min before or after reperfusion markedly reduced the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was blocked by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, thereby indicating the participation of muscarinic receptors in the antiarrhythmogenic effect of PhKv </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, recombinant PhKv (240 nM) was also efficient to attenuate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (3.8 ± 0.9 vs. 8.0 ± 1.2 arbitrary units in control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PhKv induced a significant reduction in heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was partially blunted by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and potentiated by pyridostigmine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate the participation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> on the PhKv effects, we examined the release of this neurotransmitter from neuromuscular junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was found that Phkv (200 nM) significantly increased the release of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in this preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PhKv (250 nM) did not cause any significant change in action potential or Ca(2+) transient parameters in isolated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these findings show an important <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-mediated antiarrhythmogenic effect of the spider PhKv toxin in isolated hearts </plain></SENT>
