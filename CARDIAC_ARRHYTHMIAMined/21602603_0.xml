<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our earlier studies in a group of 7,8-disubstituted derivatives of 1,3-dimetyl-3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione, a series of new 8-alkylamino-1,3-dimethyl-7-(2-hydroxy-3-aminopropyl)-3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-diones (8-15) were synthesized and tested for their electrocardiographic, antiarrhythmic and hypotensive activity and for α(1)- and α(2)-adrenoreceptor affinities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the new derivatives, compounds with the 7-[2-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylpiperazine)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>] substituent (9-11) displayed prophylactic antiarrhythmic activity in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analogue 10 with the 8-(2-morpholin-4-yl)-ethylamino group was the most active (ED(50) = 3.9 mg/kg and TI = 59.8), which may indicate that this substituent is preferably important for the antiarrhythmic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only compound 11 with the 8-(2-diethylamino)-ethylamino group significantly decreased the systolic (20.4-28.1%) and diastolic (23.4-33.2%) pressure, but this effect lasted for only 1-5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacologically active compounds 9-11 with the phenylpiperazine moiety showed affinity for α(1)-receptors (K(i) = 0.143-0.383 μM), but the other compounds were almost (12-15) or completely (8) inactive at this site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compounds 9-11 and 13-15 displayed moderate to low affinity for α(2)-receptors (K(i) = 0.36-2.7 μM) </plain></SENT>
