<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If applied appropriately, 3-D mapping systems (3DM) can reduce fluoroscopy and procedural time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, two advanced mapping systems are currently in use: the Carto™ system (Biosense Webster) uses ultralow-intensity magnetic fields to locate specially designed catheters in the heart chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both, the activation sequence (activation map) and the local potential amplitude (voltage map) can be displayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional applications are available: the SmartTouch™ Catheter offers contact force registration, while CartoMerge™ enables integration of other imaging modalities into the map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other commonly used mapping system is EnSite NavX™(Endocardial Solutions, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jude), which uses electrical current delivered across different pairs of patches on the body surface, and thereby creating voltage gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, catheter tips and shafts in a 3-D field can be localized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Special applications of this system are the automated registration of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) and a non-contact mapping function using the EnSite Array™ Mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EnSite-NavX™ system is not limited to the use of special sensor-equipped catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basically, both systems are compatible with the remote navigation systems "Niobe™" and "Sensei® </plain></SENT>
