<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis showed early cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel upregulation at embryonic stages prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of Kv <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel remodeling, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> at fetal stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In line with these findings, patch-clamp assays demonstrated changes in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current density and a slowing of recovery from inactivation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate early <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel remodeling secondary to IKs blockage in a mouse model of LQTS leading to morphological and functional anomalies in the developing ventricular conduction system and <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying fetal and neonatal cardiac electrophysiological disorders, which might help understand how molecular, functional, and morphological alterations are linked to clinical pathologies such as cardiac congenital anomalies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
