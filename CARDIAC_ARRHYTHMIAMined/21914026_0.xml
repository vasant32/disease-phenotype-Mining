<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The atrial substrate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) patients with a left atrial spontaneous echo contrast (LASEC) has not been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the atrial substrate properties and long-term follow-up results in the patients who received catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 36 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF who received a stepwise ablation approach, 18 patients with an LASEC (group I) were compared with 18 age-gender-left atrial volume matched patients without an LASEC (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The atrial substrate properties including the weighted peak-to-peak voltage, total activation time during sinus rhythm (SR), dominant frequency (DF), and complex fractionated electrograms (CFEs) during AF in the bi-atria were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The left atrial weighted bipolar peak-to-peak voltage (1.0 ± 0.6 vs 1.6 ± 0.7 mV, P = 0.04), total activation time (119 ± 20 vs 103 ± 13 ms, P &lt; 0.001) and DF (7.3 ± 1.3 vs 6.6 ± 0.7 Hz, P &lt; 0.001) differed between group I and group II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those parameters did not differ in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bi-atrial CFEs (left atrium: 89 ± 24 vs 92 ± 25, P = 0.8; right atrium: 92 ± 25 vs 102 ± 3, P = 0.9) did not differ between group I and group II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 30 ± 13 month, there were significant differences in the antiarrhythmic drugs (1.1 ± 0.3 vs 0.7 ± 0.5, P = 0.02) needed after ablation, and recurrence as persistent AF (92% vs 50%, P = 0.03) between group I and group II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multiple procedures, there were more group II patients that remained in SR, when compared with group I (78% vs 44%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a poorer atrial substrate, lesser SR maintenance after catheter ablation and need for more antiarrhythmic drugs in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF patients with an LASEC when compared with those without an LASEC </plain></SENT>
