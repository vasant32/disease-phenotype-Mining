<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to antimicrobials, complete hardware removal, mostly with percutaneous lead extraction (PLE), is necessary to limit recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, CDI diagnosis is often difficult and is sometimes delayed, and scarce data exist on how the timing of PLE may affect clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the in-hospital outcomes of 52 consecutive patients with CDIs who underwent PLE were retrospectively analyze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Co-morbidities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> were highly prevalent in the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into group A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> or device <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>) and group B (localized pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 29% in group A and 5% in group B (p = 0.02) and was due mostly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospital stays were shorter in group B patients (5.7 vs 21.7 days, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presentation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was more commonly observed in group A patients and was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, whereas pocket findings correlated with better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative courses after PLE were uneventful in most patients, and no fatal complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PLE was performed significantly earlier in group B patients (hospitalization day 1.3 vs 7.6, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PLE performed within 3 hospitalization days was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PLE performed within 3 days from admission is associated with shorter hospitalization and better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A timely diagnosis is crucial, particularly in the absence of local findings, because early treatment with PLE is likely to prevent the catastrophic outcomes of unrelenting CDIs </plain></SENT>
