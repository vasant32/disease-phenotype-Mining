<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Drug candidates must be thoroughly investigated for their potential cardiac side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the course of routine toxicological assessment, the compound RO5657, a CCR5 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, was discovered to have the rare liability of inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, healthy animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were conducted to determine the molecular mechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Toxicological effects of repeat dosing were assessed in na√Øve monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular effects were determined in conscious telemetry-implanted monkeys (repeat dosing) and anaesthetized instrumented dogs (single doses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies were performed in guinea-pig isolated hearts and in cells recombinantly expressing human cardiac channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: In cynomolgus monkeys, RO5657 caused a low incidence of myocardial degeneration and a greater incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> including prolonged QT/QTc intervals, QRS complex widening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In telemetry-implanted monkeys, RO5657 induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> and in one instance, degeneration to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RO5657 also depressed both heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), with no histological evidence of myocardial degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the anaesthetized dog and guinea-pig isolated heart studies, RO5657 induced similar cardiovascular effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RO5657 also inhibited Kv11.1 and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The molecular mechanism of RO5657 is hypothesized to be due to inhibition of cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and Kv11.1 potassium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that RO5657 is arrhythymogenic due to decreased haemodynamic function (HR/BP), decreased conduction and inhibition of multiple cardiac channels, which precede and are probably the causative factors in the observed myocardial degeneration </plain></SENT>
