<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although pulmonary vein isolation is an effective treatment for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), there is no consensus on the definition of success or follow-up strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Existing data are limited to intermittent Holter or transtelephonic monitoring with reliance on patient symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the outcomes of surgical ablation and post-ablation AF surveillance with a leadless implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal or persistent AF underwent video-assisted epicardial ablation using a bipolar radiofrequency clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ICM was implanted subcutaneously post-ablation to assess AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AF recurrence was defined as ≥1 AF episode with a duration of ≥30 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The device-stored data was downloaded weekly over the internet, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transmitted events were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,220 AF automatic and patient-activated AF episodes were analyzed over a follow-up of 12 ± 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these episodes, 46% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only 66% of the patient-activated episodes were AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF recurrence was highest in first 4 weeks and substantially decreased 6 months post-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall freedom from AF recurrence at the end of follow-up was 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When 48-h Holter recordings were compared with the device-stored episodes, the sensitivity of the device to detect AF was 98%, and the specificity was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ICM provides an objective measure of AF ablation success and may be useful in making clinical decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This device may be used in future ablation studies to develop a more rigorous definition of procedural success </plain></SENT>
