<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Often, these adult patients are treated at a freestanding pediatric facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limited data exist looking at this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrophysiology (EP) procedures performed in adults at our institution during a 5-year period from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 99 cases performed in a total of 87 adults with CHD during this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 27.1 years (18-51 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common congenital cardiac diagnoses were: 27% with D-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (n = 27)-of which 85% (n = 23) have had a previous atrial switch procedure, 20% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (n = 20), and 16% with previous Rastelli repair (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 37 EP studies were performed, with the majority done in patients with complex CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 74 additional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These procedures consisted of: 38 pacemakers (51%), 26 implantable cardiac defibrillators (36%), six laser lead extractions (8%), two loop recorders (3%), and two pocket revisions (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During this 5-year period, there was one major complication (1%) and seven minor complications (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complex care of adults with CHD requiring EP procedures can be safely and effectively accomplished in a freestanding pediatric hospital with low complications, provided institutional support of an adult CHD program </plain></SENT>
