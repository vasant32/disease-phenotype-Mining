<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Outpatient ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring is a routine part of the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current systems are limited by patient convenience and practicality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the Zio(®) Patch, a single-use, noninvasive waterproof long-term continuous monitoring patch, with a 24-hour Holter monitor in 74 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF referred for Holter monitoring for detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Zio(®) Patch was well tolerated, with a mean monitoring period of 10.8 ± 2.8 days (range 4-14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a 24-hour period, there was excellent agreement between the Zio(®) Patch and Holter for identifying AF events and estimating AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was no difference in AF burden estimated by the Zio(®) Patch and the Holter monitor, AF events were identified in 18 additional individuals, and the documented pattern of AF (persistent or paroxysmal) changed in 21 patients after Zio(®) Patch monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other clinically relevant cardiac events recorded on the Zio(®) Patch after the first 24 hours of monitoring, including symptomatic ventricular pauses, prompted referrals for pacemaker placement or changes in medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result of the findings from the Zio(®) Patch, 28.4% of patients had a change in their clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Zio(®) Patch was well tolerated, and allowed significantly longer continuous monitoring than a Holter, resulting in an improvement in clinical accuracy, the detection of potentially malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and a meaningful change in clinical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to examine the long-term impact of the use of the Zio(®) Patch in AF management </plain></SENT>
