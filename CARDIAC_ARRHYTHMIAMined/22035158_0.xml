<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) has been linked to mutations in desmosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mutation in plakophilin 2 (PKP 2) is a frequent cause for ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a new mutation in the PKP2 gene, the genotype-phenotype variation in this mutation and its clinical consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Individuals in a three-generation family were investigated after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> of a young male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, endomyocardial biopsy and genetic testing were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel heterozygote mutation, a c.368G &gt; A transition, located in exon 3 of the PKP2 gene was found (p.Trp123X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phenotype was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at an early age in some individuals, with mild abnormalities on imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new plakophilin mutation demonstrates variable penetrance and phenotypic expression in ARVC, and highlights the need of genetic testing and thorough phenotype examination in ARVC pedigrees </plain></SENT>
