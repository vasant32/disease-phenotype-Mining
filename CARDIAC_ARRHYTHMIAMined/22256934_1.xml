<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Retrospective observational study analysing data from calls regarding energy drink exposures recorded in the database of an Australian poisons information centre over 7 years to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of exposure; co-ingestants; symptoms reported; and reported hospitalisations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Callers reported 297 exposures to energy drinks, which showed an increasing annual trend from 12 in 2004 to 65 in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age for the 217 subjects with recreational exposure was 17 years (interquartile ratio [IQR], 15-21; range, 11-60) and 57% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred recreational users co-ingested other substances, predominantly alcohol (50) or other caffeinated products (44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of energy drinks consumed in one session varied greatly (median, 5 units; IQR, 3-8; range, 1-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most subjects who reported recreational use reported experiencing symptoms (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> and gastrointestinal upset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one subjects had signs of serious cardiac or neurological toxicity, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">cardiac ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At least 128 subjects (57 with no co-ingestants) required hospitalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reports of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> toxicity from energy drink consumption are increasing, particularly among adolescents, warranting review and regulation of the labelling and sale of these drinks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Educating adolescents and increasing the community's awareness of the hazards from energy drinks is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
