<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomised 2:1 to autologous skeletal myoblast therapy vs. optimal medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary safety end-point was defined as the incidence of procedural and device related serious adverse events, whereas the efficacy endpoints were defined as the change in global LVEF by MUGA scan, change in NYHA classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and in the distance achieved during a six-minute walk test (6MW) at 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty subjects were randomised to the treatment arm (n=26), or to the control arm (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 12 sustained arrhythmic events and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in the treatment group and 14 events in the control group (P=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6-month follow-up, 6MW distance improved by 60.3±54.1?meters in the treated group as compared to no improvement in the control group (0.4±185.7?meters; P=ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 28.6% experienced worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> status (4/14), while 14.3% experienced an improvement in NYHA classification (2/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the myoblast-treatment arm, one patient experienced a deterioration in NYHA classification (8.0%), whereas five patients improved one or two classes (20.0%; P=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, therapy did not improve global LVEF measured by MUGA at 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that implantation of myoblasts in patients with HF is feasible, appears to be safe and may provide symptomatic relief, though no significant effect was detected on global LVEF </plain></SENT>
