<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Introduction of new methods of testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transmissible diseases</z:e>, blood banking and dispatch regulations has considerably increased the cost of blood products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of allogeneic red-blood-cell (ARBC) transfusion remain assumed yet undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of ARBC transfusion in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:   This was a multicenter observational study comparing Jehovah's Witness (JW) patients with matched ARBC-transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were age ≥15 years and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> ≤ 80 g/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two JW patients with palliative care <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and five JW patients with <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) concentration between 70·1 and 80 g/l, mild symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and Auckland <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> Mortality Risk Score of 0-3 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   The entry criteria were met by 103 JW patients and the same number of patients treated with ARBC transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ARBC transfusion reduced mortality by 94%, shock by 88%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> by 81%, infective complications by 81%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> by 96%, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> by 86%, ischaemic myocardial injury by 81%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> by 66%, neurologic complications by 92%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> by 76%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> by 91% and syncopal episodes by 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ARBC transfusion was 2011 US$22 515 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   ARBC transfusion in anaemic patients is clinically beneficial and cost-effective </plain></SENT>
