<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (TTC) is increasingly well-recognized as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest-pain</z:hpo> syndromes, especially in aging females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common complications of TTC occur in the first 24 hours post <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and include shock and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypothesis that the severity of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in TTC reflects the extent of myocardial involvement and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 80 consecutive TTC patients, correlates of blood pressure on the day of admission were sought via univariate followed by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) on day 1 was 120 ± 24 (SD) mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the first 3 days of admission, 39% of patients had SBP &lt;90 mm Hg, and 9% died and/or required intra-aortic balloon pump insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of release of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, with its potential correlate of associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> activity, varied inversely with pulmonary-artery saturation, a measure of cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant relationship between normetanephrine release and SBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses there was no significant relationship between SBP and (1) wall-motion score index (as an index of left-ventricular systolic dysfunction) or (2) T2 enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and peak N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (as indices of myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and shock occur commonly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of TTC, these complications are multifactorial in origin, probably representing a combination of impaired inotropic state and vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> does not imply severe left ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
