<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genotype-phenotype correlation in this severe subgroup, we identified a cohort of nine patients with infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> who also carried a very short (10-13kb) EcoRI fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their current age ranged from 8 to 33years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> ranged from 0.4 to 5years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient even manifested his first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e>-related symptoms at as early as 5months of age, including inability to smile, poor response to call, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, four patients were wheelchair-bound and six patients had asymmetric <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> and abnormal fundoscopic findings were observed in eight and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three with the smallest EcoRI fragments (10-11kb, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> length being 50-300kb) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of these had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were found in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Restrictive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0231926" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventilatory defects</z:e> were observed in seven patients, with one progressing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo>; one of these required gastrostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We identified several rarely reported phenotypes in infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There seems to be a correlation between the severity of phenotype and the very short EcoRI fragment in the chromosome 4q35 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the high frequency of multi-organ involvements in this severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FSHD</z:e> variant suggests the need for an early and multidisciplinary intervention </plain></SENT>
