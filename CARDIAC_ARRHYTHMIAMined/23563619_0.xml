<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: There are only few descriptions of patients without prior cardiac surgery in whom a large low-voltage zone (LVZ) or scar is the electrophysiological substrate for various atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the electrophysiological and electroanatomic characteristics of unusual macroreentrant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> (MRATs) in seven patients with spontaneous right atrial (RA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> and present long-term follow-up results.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 7 of 326 patients with MRAT treated with radiofrequency ablation we detected regions of RA spontaneous LVZ or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> during conventional mapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They underwent electroanatomic mapping and catheter ablation of the spontaneous and further induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 different atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> were observed with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five patients a LVZ was found in the RA free wall and two patients had a septal scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stable circuits were around the scar or LVZ in four patients and through a 'channel' within the scar in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation sites included the cavotricuspid isthmus for typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, between the inferior vena cava and scar, a channel in the scar or the left atrial (LA) mitral isthmus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 34 Â± 5 months, four patients were free from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients with a septal RA scar developed LA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, requiring further catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with a novel type of atypical scar-related RA flutter.CONCLUSION: Mapping and ablation of scar-related RA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> is an effective treatment but does not preclude the development of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, some of them arising from the LA during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
