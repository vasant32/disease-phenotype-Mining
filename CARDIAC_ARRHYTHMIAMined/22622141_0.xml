<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> after a pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation procedure can unmask residual, so-called 'dormant', conduction that would otherwise remain unnoticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elimination of these dormant potentials is challenging because of the transient effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, often requiring repeated injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi>, a drug which inhibits <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deamination, can provoke longer-lasting unmasking of dormant conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 191 patients with drug refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, a bolus of 12-24 mg of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was administered after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 764 PVs were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of transient dormant conduction, a short infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> 50 mg was given and a bolus of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, re-isolation was attempted guided by the activation pattern in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> on a circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced dormant conduction before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> was recorded as the time between administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and cessation of dormant conduction either spontaneously or by catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient dormant conduction was re-established by a single bolus of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> in 24 of 191 patients (12.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced dormant conduction before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> was 13.1 ± 6.4 s, whereas it was significantly longer at 218.9 ± 165.6 s after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 24 PVs were re-isolated by catheter ablation before spontaneous cessation of dormant conduction, and in 6 cases dormant conduction disappeared spontaneously before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> re-isolation was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">Dipyridamole</z:chebi> significantly prolongs the effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> to unmask dormant conduction after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation and may thus facilitate its elimination by catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
