<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Curcuma has long been used as an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35472">anti-inflammatory agent</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since gastrointestinal motility is impaired in inflammatory states, the aim of this work was to evaluate if Curcuma Longa had any effect on intestinal motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The biological activity of Curcuma extract was evaluated against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> induced contraction in isolated mice intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100281'>chronic colitis</z:hpo> were induced in Balb/c mice by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34674">Dextran Sulphate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> administration (5% and 2.5% respectively) and either Curcuma extract (200 mg/kg/day) or placebo was thereafter administered for 7 and 21 days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous contractions and the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">Atropine</z:chebi> of ileum and colon were studied after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> induction and Curcuma administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Curcuma extract reduced the spontaneous contractions in the ileum and colon; the maximal response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> was inhibited in a non-competitive and reversible manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained in ileum and colon from Curcuma fed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DSS administration decreased the motility, mainly in the colon and Curcuma almost restored both the spontaneous contractions and the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> after 14 days assumption, compared to standard diet, but a prolonged assumption of Curcuma decreased the spontaneous and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi>-induced contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Curcuma extract has a direct and indirect myorelaxant effect on mouse ileum and colon, independent of the anti-inflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The indirect effect is reversible and non-competitive with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38323">cholinergic agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the use of curcuma extract as a spasmolytic agent </plain></SENT>
