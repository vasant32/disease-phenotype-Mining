<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Current guidelines recommend that patients with infected cardiac rhythm management device (CRMD) sites undergo removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> system components (pulse-generator and leads) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, lead removal may not be an option for patients who lack access to state-of-the-art technology, lack the necessary financial resources, or are at very high risk because of age or concomitant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case series, we report our successful experience with conservative treatment of five such patients, who had CRMD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections localized</z:e> to the device pocket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The device pocket and remaining hardware were completely sterilized to successfully eradicate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-viable tissue, chronically inflamed tissue, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, and scar tissue were completely removed, with special attention to complete haemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-essential foreign materials, including old sutures and plastic suture anchoring sleeves, were removed, and the remaining hardware was completely sterilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To achieve this goal, we used mechanical means (scrubbing and pulsed lavage), as well as a closed antimicrobial irrigation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases, the pulse-generator site was saved, lead removal was avoided, and the patients were free of local or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> for a minimum of 1 year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our conservative approach to the management of infected CRMD sites is feasible and beneficial in selected patients who are at very high risk for lead removal or who lack access to the technology necessary for safe performance of this procedure, provided that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is limited to the implant site </plain></SENT>
