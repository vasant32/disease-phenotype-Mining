<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little data exist regarding the use of magnetic navigation (MN) and its potential benefits for ablation of AP-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively gathered data in children undergoing radiofrequency ablation at our institution since the installation of MN (Stereotaxis Inc, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Louis, MO) in March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety between an MN-guided approach and standard manual techniques for mapping and ablation of AP-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 26-month study period, 145 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation for AP-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three patients were ablated with MN and 72 with a standard manual approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in demographic factors between the 2 groups with a mean cohort age of 13.1Â±4.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success rates were equivalent with 68 of 73 (93.2%) patients in the MN group being successfully ablated versus 68 of 72 (94.4%) patients in the manual group (P=0.889) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 21.4 months, there were no recurrences in the MN group and 2 recurrences in the manual group (P=0.388) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in time to effect, number of lesions delivered, or average ablation power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference in total procedure time, but fluoroscopy time was significantly reduced in the MN group at 14.0 (interquartile range, 3.8-23.9) minutes compared with the manual group at 28.1 (interquartile range, 15.3-47.3) minutes (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no complications in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MN is a safe and effective approach to ablate AP-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
