<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic (ECG), cardiac enzyme, and serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> abnormalities occur after SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme abnormalities are described as variables in SAP patients, which contribute to the effects of MODS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypomagnesium is also closely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>; therefore, hypomagnesium was also considered to be a variable in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A consecutive series of 54 patients admitted within 72 hours after SAP occurred was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A standard 12-lead ECG, cardiac enzyme, and serum <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> measurement were routinely performed at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear correlation was used to analyze the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nonparametic binomial test was used to analyze dichotomized dependent variables (premature beat, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010505'>abnormal T wave</z:mp>, and long QT interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>Hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> was present in 15 patients (28%), who subsequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative relationship (-1 &lt; r &lt;0) between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
