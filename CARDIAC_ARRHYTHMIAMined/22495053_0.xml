<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thoracoscopic ablation in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients aged from 42 to 77 years (mean 56.4 years) with persistent or long-standing persistent AF were scheduled for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thoracoscopic epicardial ablation of the right atrium, pulmonary veins, and left atrium was performed on the beating heart using the Cox MAZE III-based diagram, via 3 ports and 2 cm incision below the xiphoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exit block was always assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were prospectively followed for 12 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24-hour electrocardiography (Holter monitoring) was used to confirm the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Conduction block across ablation lines was achieved in 21 patients (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 month of follow-up, the sinus rhythm (SR) was observed in 18 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the SR was observed in 19 patients (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, while 3 still experienced AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, the SR was observed in 21 patients (84%); 2 patients still had AF, 1 patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and 1 patient had a pacemaker implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results of follow-up at 1 year did not differ from those at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No changes in the size of the left atrium and left ventricular ejection fraction, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, or infectious complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of epicardial thoracoscopic ablation of the left and right atrium was high, reaching 84% during 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No serious complications were observed in the postoperative period (except for the need for pacemaker implantation in 1 patient) </plain></SENT>
