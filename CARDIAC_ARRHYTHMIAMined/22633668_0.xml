<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of epicardial fat on atrial electrophysiology were not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was to evaluate whether HF may modulate the effects of epicardial fat on atrial electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional microelectrodes recording was used to record the action potential in left (LA) and right (RA) atria of healthy (control) rabbits before and after application of epicardial fat from control or HF (ventricular pacing of 360-400bpm for 4weeks) rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adipokine profiles were checked in epicardial fat of control and HF rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LA 90% of AP duration was prolonged by control epicardial fat (from 77±6 to 87±7ms, p&lt;0.05, n=7), and by HF epicardial fat (from 78±3 to 98±4ms, p&lt;0.001, n=9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, control or HF epicardial fat did not change the AP <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HF epicardial fat increased the contractility in LA (61±11 vs. 35±6mg, p=0.001), but not in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Control fat did not change the LA or RA contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, control and HF epicardial fat induced early and delayed afterdepolarizations in LA and RA, but only HF epicardial fat provoked spontaneous activity and burst firing in LA (n=3/9, 33.3% vs. n=0/7, 0%, n=0/9, 0%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to control fat, HF epicardial fat, had lower resistin, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, but similar interluekin-6, leptin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, adiponectin and adipsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HF epicardial fat increases atrial arrhythmogenesis, which may contribute to the higher atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
