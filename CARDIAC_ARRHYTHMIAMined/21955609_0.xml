<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are often identified incidentally, or in conjunction with an acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Untreated they may lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with consequences including right ventricular overload and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, shunt reversal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deciding whether to close an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> can consume as much clinical time as finding them or indeed closing them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the past when surgical closure was the only option, the morbidity of the procedure, including the need for sternotomy or thoracotomy, limited its use to large defects considered likely to result in shunt reversal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smaller defects were often managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However within the past 2 decades percutaneous closure has come to the fore and is now considered first line when <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> allows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With lower morbidity, this has "lowered the bar" in terms of who is considered for closure, although the absolute mortality risk of either procedure is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, even though mortality is low, morbidity is still significant after percutaneous closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the utilisation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure has dramatically increased in the last decade with a sudden rise from 2001, owing largely to growth in percutaneous closures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Instead of looking for symptoms, which are subjective, or evidence of large shunt/RV failure, an objective measure of exercise capacity might help identify other patients who would benefit from closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This review will look at the current evidence of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure </plain></SENT>
