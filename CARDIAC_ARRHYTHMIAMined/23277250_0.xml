<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>QT interval prolongation by medications, including both conventional and atypical antipsychotic drugs, can predispose patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">schizoaffective disorder</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electrocardiograms at baseline (N = 188) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to iloperidone, 8 mg twice daily (BID), 12 mg BID, 24 mg once daily (QD); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi>, 375 mg BID; or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi>, 80 mg BID during period 1 (no metabolic inhibitors present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Iloperidone BID produced mean changes in QTc Fridericia correction (QTcF) interval (8.5-9.0 milliseconds [ms]) similar to those produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> (9.6 ms) and higher than those produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi> (1.3 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Iloperidone, 24 mg QD, produced a mean QTcF change of 15.4 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coadministration of metabolic inhibitors with iloperidone during periods 2 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi>) and 3 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi>) resulted in greater increases in the QTc interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased QTc was observed in individuals with specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 2D6 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Up to 10% of patients on iloperidone experienced QTc intervals of 60 ms or longer in the presence of metabolic inhibition and QD dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no patients experienced QTc changes of clinical concern (QTc â‰¥ 500 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events with iloperidone were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only cardiovascular adverse events with iloperidone were non-concentration-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> that was mild in most patients and did not lead to further sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacogenetics and recommendations are discussed </plain></SENT>
