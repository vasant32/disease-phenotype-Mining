<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: We have previously demonstrated the protective role of endogenous ghrelin against malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the very <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of endogenous ghrelin in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the current study was to focus on the effects of endogenous ghrelin on cardiac function and sympathetic activation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and results: In 46 ghrelin-knockout (KO) and 41 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) male mice, MI was produced by left coronary artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> within 2 weeks was 0% in WT and 10.9% in KO (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of this period, lung weight/tibial length, atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> transcripts, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly greater in KO mice, whereas systolic function, represented by ejection fraction (16.4 ± 4.7% vs. 25.3 ± 5.1%), end-systolic elastance, and preload-recruitable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work, was significantly inferior to that in WT mice (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Telemetry recording and heart rate variability analysis showed that KO mice had stronger sympathetic activation after MI than did WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment and ghrelin treatment in KO mice prevented excessive sympathetic activation, decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels, and improved heart function and survival rate after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that endogenous ghrelin plays a crucial role in protecting heart function and reducing mortality after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and that these effects seem to be partly the result of sympathetic inhibition </plain></SENT>
