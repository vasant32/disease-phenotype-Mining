<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An international multicenter review of 43 children with cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (SCN5A) mutations and clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> syndrome without overlap of other SCN5A syndromes was undertaken to describe the clinical characteristics of LQT3 in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were aged 7.6 ± 5.9 years at presentation and were followed for 4.7 ± 3.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant intrasubject corrected QT interval (QTc) variability on serial electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent presented with severe symptoms or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and exhibited longer QTc intervals compared to asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 14 patients who underwent primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation received appropriate shocks in 41 patient-years of follow-up, while 2 of 6 patients who underwent secondary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation received appropriate shocks in 30 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half of patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation experienced inappropriate shocks or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine significantly shortened the QTc interval, and QTc shortening was greater in patients with longer pretreated QTc intervals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, severe symptoms are common in children with LQT3 and are associated with longer QTc intervals </plain></SENT>
