<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The use of dried blood spots (DBS) samples in genomic workup has been limited by the relative low amounts of genomic DNA (gDNA) they contain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains to be proven that whole genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA) from stored DBS samples, constitutes a reliable alternative to gDNA.We wanted to compare melting curves and sequencing results from wgaDNA derived from DBS samples with gDNA derived from whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: gDNA was extracted from whole blood obtained from 10 patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (mean age 22.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From their newborn DBS samples, stored at -24Â°C, genomic DNA was extracted and whole-genome amplified in triplicates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using high resolution melting curve analysis and direct sequencing in both wgaDNA and gDNA samples, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding regions and adjacent intron regions of the genes SCN5A and KCNA5 were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altered melting curves was present in 85 of wgaDNA samples and 81 of gDNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis identified a total of 31 variants in the 10 wgaDNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same 31 variants were found in the exact same pattern of samples in the gDNA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no false positive or negative sequence variation in the wgaDNA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of DNA amplified in triplicates from DBS samples is reliable and can be used both for high resolution curve melting analysis as well as direct sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DBS samples therefore can serve as an alternative to whole blood in sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
