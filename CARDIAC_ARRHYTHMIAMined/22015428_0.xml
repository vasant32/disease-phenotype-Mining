<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> have abnormal systemic venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> which can complicate electrophysiologic testing, catheter ablation and pacemaker and defibrillator implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the systemic venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in a cohort of patients undergoing electrophysiologic testing and catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrophysiologic studies performed in patients with adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (n = 80) at our institution between January 1998 and October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (13%) had a congenital systemic venous anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, seven (9%) had a left superior vena cava and four (5%) had infrahepatic interruption of the inferior vena cava (two had both anomalies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient's inferior vena cava was connected to a left-sided atrium; she had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011536'>right atrial isomerism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four patients (40%), systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> were discovered at the time of electrophysiologic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic venous anomalies occur frequently in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> population and may complicate electrophysiologic testing and catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-procedural imaging may assist in facilitating a successful procedure </plain></SENT>
