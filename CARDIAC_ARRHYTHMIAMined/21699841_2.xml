<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On rare occasions, LA entry cannot be achieved or cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare a new radiofrequency (RF) transseptal needle with the standard needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 1,550 AF ablations in 1,167 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared 975 transseptal punctures done using a standard needle to 575 done using a new electrode-tipped needle attached to an RF <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of failure to cross the atrial septum was lower for the RF needle (1 of 575 [0.17%] vs. 12 of 975 [1.23%], P = .039) and there were fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponades</z:e> with the RF needle (0 of 575 [0.00%] vs. 9 of 975 [0.92%], P = .031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed the RF needle use was the only variable associated with a lower incidence of tamponade (P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Becasuse the RF needle was used later in our series, we examined our 975 standard needle punctures over time for evidence of improved operator experience that might explain the superior RF results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the standard needle, there was no trend for improved septal crossing rates (P = .794) or fewer tamponades (P = .456) with more operator experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Instrumentation time was shorter for the RF needle (27.1 ± 10.9 vs. 36.4 ± 17.7 minutes, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the RF needle is superior to the standard transseptal needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It results in shorter instrumentation times, a greater efficacy in transseptal crossing, and fewer episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> </plain></SENT>
