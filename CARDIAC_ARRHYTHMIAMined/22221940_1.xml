<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess exercise test results and efficacy of therapy with a β blocker (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi>) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor type 2 (RyR2) mutation carriers with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) and long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty RyR2 mutation carriers belonging to 8 families and regularly followed at our center were analyzed using a study protocol involving electrocardiography, exercise tests off and on β-blocker therapy, 2-dimensional echocardiography, and signal-averaged electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Off-therapy exercise testing triggered the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VAs at different heart rates (mean 132 ± 13 beats/min) with various patterns that worsened while exercising and disappeared immediately after stopping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most severe VAs detected were nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 35% and ventricular couplets in 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining subjects single <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 15% of patients single monomorphic <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> were detected and identified to be linked to RyR2 mutations owing to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> of their family members and subsequent family screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">Acebutolol</z:chebi> made the VAs disappear completely in 20% of subjects and decreased their complexity in 50%, whereas it did not change VAs appreciably in 30% of patients with less complex VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 11 ± 8 years of follow-up 2 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, exercise testing was a fundamental tool for assessing the clinical phenotype and efficacy of therapy in RyR2 mutation carriers and therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2379">acebutolol</z:chebi> led in most subjects to a decreased complexity of the arrhythmic pattern or to complete suppression </plain></SENT>
