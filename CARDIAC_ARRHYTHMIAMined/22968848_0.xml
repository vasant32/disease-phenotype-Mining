<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The PLASMA (Probabilidad de Sufrir Muerte Arritmica) study was designed to characterize management of cardiac patients in Latin America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve centres included 1958 consecutively admitted patients in cardiology units in 2008 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Discharged patients were evaluated for primary prevention, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> indication and prescription by general cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 1711 discharged patients, 1525 (89%) had data available for evaluating indication status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Class I indications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy were met for 153 (10%) patients based on collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 20 (13%, 95% confidence interval: 7.7-18.4%) patients with indication were prescribed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients prescribed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were younger than patients who were not prescribed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (62 vs. 68 years, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reasons given by cardiologists for not prescribing an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for 133 patients with an indication were: indication criteria not met (75%), life expectancy &lt;1 year (9.7%), rejection by the patient (5.2%), no medical coverage paying for the device (3.7%), psychiatric patient (2.2%), and other reasons (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In Latin America, international guidelines for primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation are not well followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main reason is that cardiologists believe that patients do not meet indication criteria, even though study data confirm that criteria are met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This poses a significant challenge and underlines the importance of continuous and improved medical education </plain></SENT>
