<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-control study the population consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent elective non-cardiovascular, non-thoracic surgery under general inhalation anesthesia during the period of 12 months in a secondary care hospital in Foƒça, Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and were classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification to class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases (n=57) included patients with at least one episode of ECG-recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during general anesthesia, and controls (n=90) were sex and age matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant association was found between intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the last five years (adjusted OR 43.5; CI 2.3, 820.1; p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synergistic effects on intra-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were found for history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp>, as well as for history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> for induction of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The non-cardiovascular, non-thoracic surgery patients with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> deserve special attention, correction of electrolyte disturbances and avoidance of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> for induction of general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
