<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential improvement of esophageal damage when the number of irrigation channels of the ablation catheter was increased during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included a total of 296 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive PVI using an ablation catheter with six distal irrigation channels (6C) and 148 patients to receive PVI using an ablation catheter with 12 distal irrigation channels (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> esophageal temperature (LET) was monitored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 639 radiofrequency energy applications (in 225 out of 296 patients) reached the cut-off temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time for the LET to reach the cut-off temperature was shorter for the 6C than the <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi> group, and the 6C group had a higher T max of the LET than the <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients experienced a transient drop in the LET (TDLET) just before the delivery of the energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The site that caused a TDLET before the energy delivery always reached the cut-off temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TDLET was more frequent in the 6C group than in the <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The LET only showed a small difference between the 6C and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there may be a lower risk of esophageal injury with the 6C than the <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36931">12C</z:chebi> if we use TDLET </plain></SENT>
