<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, possible predictors of cardiac events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (DM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical and non-invasive cardiac and respiratory investigations were obtained from 107 DM1 patients, who were regularly re-examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end-points were occurrence of cardiac events (pacemaker implantation or tachyarrhythmia) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probability of an event was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, while contributing factors were assessed using univariate and multivariate (Cox model) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiac events occurred in 34 patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, muscular impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003593'>infantile onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002091'>restrictive lung disease</z:hpo> (RLD), ECG <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 50%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detected during Holter monitoring were predictors of cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that age, RLD, ECG <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, Holter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and LVEF remained independent predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probability of cardiac events was 2.5% (5%CI: 0-7%) at 1 year and 6% (5%CI: 0-14%) at 3 years in patients younger than 42 years with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG, Holter, LVEF and lung volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advancing age, distal or proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and RLD characterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-survivors (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are predicted not only by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in DM1, but also by RLD, muscular disability and advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Addition of these criteria should modulate time intervals for patient follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In young patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline investigations, screening investigations every 2 or 3 years seem to be sufficient </plain></SENT>
