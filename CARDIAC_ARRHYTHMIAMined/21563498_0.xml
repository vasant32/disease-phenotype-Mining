<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty dogs were randomly divided into 5 groups, the model group administrated with equal volume of distilled water, the positive control group administrated with Wenxin Granules, and the small, medium and large dosage LFKC groups, 6 dogs in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after medication, electrocardiogram was conducted and the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence, times of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beat</z:mp> (VP), and incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) were recorded in the model dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by ligation of coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the occurrence time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by the coronary artery ligation in the medium and large LFKC groups was significantly delayed (20.45 +/- 9.10 and 19.92 +/- 3.78, respectively, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of VP in the medium and large LFKC groups was also significantly decreased (8.17 +/- 6.62 and 3.83 +/- 2.79, respectively, both P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LFKC has anti-arrhythmic effects for the experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by the ligation of coronary artery in dogs </plain></SENT>
