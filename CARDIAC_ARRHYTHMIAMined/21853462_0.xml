<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of a membrane closing the orifice of the CS may cause difficulties during these interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, detailed knowledge of the variations and anomalies of the valve of the CS, or the Thebesian valve, now has practical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To improve our understanding of this structure, classic anatomical dissection of 50 hearts from dissection room cadavers was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Thebesian valve was present in the overwhelming majority (88%) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Its <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> varied widely, from a few small strands of tissue, to a membrane covering more than half the CS ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant number (20%) of valves occluded &gt;65% of the ostium, making them "potential complicating factors" in cannulation of the CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An understanding of these anatomical variations may help in identifying and overcoming potential difficulties during clinical cardiac interventions </plain></SENT>
