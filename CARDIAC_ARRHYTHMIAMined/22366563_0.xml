<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) have been investigated, no information is available on the effects on cardiac vagal nerve activity (VNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed in rats the responses of cardiac VNA, SNA and cardiovascular variables to intravenous bolus administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 34 urethane-anaesthetized rats, cardiac VNA or cervical preganglionic sympathetic fibres were recorded together with ECG, arterial pressure and ventilation, before and after administration of three doses of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (100, 500 and 1000 μg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> were also assessed in isolated perfused hearts (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> induced marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, associated with a significant dose-dependent increase in VNA (+204 ± 56%, P &lt; 0.01; +275 ± 120%, P &lt; 0.01; and +372 ± 78%, P &lt; 0.01, for the three doses, respectively; n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Muscarinic blockade by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (5 mg kg(-1), i.v.) significantly blunted the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (-56.0 ± 4.5%, P &lt; 0.05; -86.2 ± 10.5%, P &lt; 0.01; and -34.3 ± 9.7%, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was markedly less in isolated heart preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous barodenervation did not modify the effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> on VNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the SNA side, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> administration was associated with a dose-dependent biphasic response, including overactivation in the first few seconds followed by a later profound SNA reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earliest sympathetic activation was abolished by barodenervation, while subsequent sympathetic withdrawal was affected neither by baro- nor by chemodenervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> is able to activate cardiac VNA, possibly through a central action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This increase in vagal outflow could make an important contribution to the antiarrhythmic action of this substance </plain></SENT>
