<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recruitment of stretch-activated channels, one of the mechanisms of mechano-electric feedback, has been shown to influence the stability of scroll waves, the waves that underlie reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a comprehensive study to examine the effects of recruitment of stretch-activated channels with different reversal potentials and conductances on scroll wave stability has not been undertaken; the mechanisms by which stretch-activated channel opening alters scroll wave stability are also not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goals of this study were to test the hypothesis that recruitment of stretch-activated channels affects scroll wave stability differently depending on stretch-activated channel reversal potential and channel conductance, and to uncover the relevant mechanisms underlying the observed behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a strongly-coupled model of human ventricular electromechanics that incorporated human ventricular geometry and fiber and sheet orientation reconstructed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and diffusion tensor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since a wide variety of reversal potentials and channel conductances have been reported for stretch-activated channels, two reversal potentials, -60 mV and -10 mV, and a range of channel conductances (0 to 0.07 mS/µF) were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Opening of stretch-activated channels with a reversal potential of -60 mV diminished scroll wave breakup for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values of conductances by flattening heterogeneously the action potential duration restitution curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Opening of stretch-activated channels with a reversal potential of -10 mV inhibited partially scroll wave breakup at low conductance values (from 0.02 to 0.04 mS/µF) by flattening heterogeneously the conduction velocity restitution relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For large conductance values (&gt;0.05 mS/µF), recruitment of stretch-activated channels with a reversal potential of -10 mV did not reduce the likelihood of scroll wave breakup because Na channel inactivation in regions of large stretch led to conduction block, which counteracted the increased scroll wave stability due to an overall flatter conduction velocity restitution </plain></SENT>
