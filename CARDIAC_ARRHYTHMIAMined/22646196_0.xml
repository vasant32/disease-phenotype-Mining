<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> (AM) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> in grazing horses that mainly affects skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examinations have shown that myocardial damage also occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on the effect of AM on cardiac function in affected and surviving horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes associated with AM in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of the disease and after follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Horses (n = 12) diagnosed with AM in which cardiac ultrasound examination and ECG recording were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> horses underwent clinical examinations, serum biochemistry, electrocardiography, and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four surviving horses underwent the same examinations after 2-10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 horse had increased cardiac troponin I concentrations and 10 horses had ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> horses had prolonged corrected QT (QT(cf) ) intervals on the day of admission and abnormal myocardial wall motion on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the surviving horses still had VPDs and prolonged QT(cf) at follow-up after 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The AM results in characteristic electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes and may be associated with increased cardiac troponin I concentrations and VPDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In survivors, abnormal cardiac function still may be found at follow-up after 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional research in a larger group of horses is necessary to identify the long-term effects of AM on cardiac function </plain></SENT>
