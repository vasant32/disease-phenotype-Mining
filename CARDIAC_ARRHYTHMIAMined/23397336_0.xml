<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although significant <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve regurgitation</z:mp> (AVVR) is well known for its association with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, there is a lack of consensus in management of AVVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcomes in patients receiving AVV repair or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 2001 to 2010, a total of 33 patients (25 male and 8 female) with more than moderate-degree AVVR among 160 patients who underwent staged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> palliation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 6.0 years (range 0.1-14.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Valve repair (n = 27) or valve replacement (n = 6) was performed at the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were six late mortalities (18.18 %): five in the repair group and one in the replacement group and seven morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with valve repair, 11 were required to undergo redo-valve operations (valve repair n = 6, valve replacement n = 5) due to deteriorated valve function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial shunt procedure (p = 0.04) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p = 0.01) were risk factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Freedom from reoperation in the valve replacement group was higher than that in the valve repair group (67.0 ± 9.7 and 44.6 ± 11.2 % at 5 and 6 years, respectively, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Need for early repair (p = 0.02), presence of mitral- or tricuspid-dominant AVV (p = 0.005), and male sex (p = 0.04) were risk factors for valve durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early valve regurgitation affects valve durability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, successful repair in the early stage may improve later outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aggressive valve surgery was required and AVV replacement might be one of the options for selected patients </plain></SENT>
