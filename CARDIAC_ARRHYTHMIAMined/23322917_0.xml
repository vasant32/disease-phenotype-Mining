<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between occupational ELF-MF exposure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) mortality within a community-based prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Netherlands Cohort Study is a prospective cohort study among 120 852 men and women aged 55-69 years at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were followed-up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality over a period of 10 years, resulting in 8200 CVD <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on occupational history and potential confounders, such as educational level, smoking and alcohol use were collected at baseline through a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occupational ELF-MF exposure was assigned using a job-exposure matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality were analysed using Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ever low or high exposure to ELF-MF showed no association with total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality (HR of 1.02, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.06), nor with any cause-specific subtypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other ELF-MF exposure metrics showed no increased risks either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no indication of an association between occupational ELF-MF exposure and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
