<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify sotalol's classification in the BCS versus BDDCS systems through cellular, rat everted sac and PAMPA permeability studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies were carried out in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and MDR1-transfected MDCK (MDCK-MDR1) cell lines, rat everted gut sacs and the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-hour transport studies were conducted in MDCK cell lines (with apical pH changes) and MDCK-MDR1 cells (with and without the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> inhibitor GG918); male Sprague-Dawley rats (300~350 g) were used to prepare everted sacs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the PAMPA studies, drug solutions at different pH's were dosed in each well and incubated for 5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples were measured by LC-MS/MS, or liquid scintillation counting and apparent permeability (P(app)) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sotalol showed low permeability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cultured-cell lines, everted sacs and PAMPA systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It might be a border line P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PAMPA study showed that sotalol's permeability increased with a higher apical pH, while much less change was found in MDCK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low permeability rate for sotalol correlates with its Class 3 BDDCS assignment and lack of in vivo metabolism </plain></SENT>
