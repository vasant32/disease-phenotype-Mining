<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical correlates and prognostic value of P-wave duration in patients with ST elevation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients (n = 89) were evaluated on the first, second and third day after admission, as well as one week and one month post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival was determined 2 years after the index <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of P-wave duration (&lt;120 msec), the P-wave duration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients was significantly increased on the first day (135.31 +/- 29.29 msec, P &lt; 0.001), up to day 7 (127.17 +/- 30.02 msec, P = 0.0455) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most prominent differences were observed in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; or = 40% (155.47 +/- 33.8 msec), compared to LVEF &gt; 40% (128.79 +/- 28 msec) (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>P-wave duration above 120 msec was significantly correlated with increased complication rate; namely, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (36%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (41%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (11%), recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (14%), and re-infarction (8%) (P = 0.012, odds ratio 4.267, 95% confidence interval 1.37-13.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P-wave duration of 126 msec on the day of admission was found to have the highest predictive value for in-hospital complications including LVEF 40% (area under the curve 0.741, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find a significant correlation between P-wave duration and mortality after multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: P-wave duration as evaluated by SAECG correlates negatively with LVEF post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, and P-wave duration above 126 msec can be utilized as a non-invasive predictor of in-hospital complications and low LVEF following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
