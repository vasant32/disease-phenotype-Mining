<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study objectives were to assess 2-year outcomes in a population implanted with a CRT plus defibrillator device in accordance with the standard of care and to evaluate any independent association between clinical variables and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 406 patients enrolled at 35 centers in Italy were followed up prospectively for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient management decisions were left to the treating physician's discretion, in accordance with clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACTION-HF patients had a better baseline clinical status than patients enrolled in the COMPANION study: shorter HF history (1 vs 3.5 years, P &lt; 0.01), less advanced NYHA functional class (III-IV: 73% vs 100%, P &lt; 0.01), higher LVEF (26% vs 21%, P &lt; 0.01), higher SBP (122 vs 112 mmHg, P &lt; 0.01), and less <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (27% vs 41%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This status was reflected in lower mortality (11.5% vs 26%) and a lower incidence of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks (12.1% vs 19.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF history was an independent predictor of the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and cardiac-cause hospitalization (HR: 3.31; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent or new atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were independently associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (HR: 3.4; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This population appears clinically less compromised and had a lower incidence of adverse clinical outcomes than those of reference trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we recorded a substantial burden of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which was independently associated with a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
