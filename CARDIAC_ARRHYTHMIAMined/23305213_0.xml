<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over three decades of research and clinical applications, these phenomena have demonstrated that they stay as a main tool for an intellectual understanding of reentry and to base strategies for localization of critical areas for ablative therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review will be divided into two parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This first part deals with the bases for the concept development, the means for the detection of these phenomena, and their mechanistic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resetting is described as a particular response of a given rhythm to an external perturbation, indicating interaction between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Entrainment indicates continuous reset of the rhythm when the perturbation is repetitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms that explain these responses in reentrant rhythms are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fusion, both at the surface electrocardiogram and at the level of intracardiac recordings, is discussed in detail, with its value and limitations as a key concept to recognize entrainment and reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations are used as an aid to a better understanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between resetting and entrainment are considered, and a pacing protocol to study these phenomena described </plain></SENT>
