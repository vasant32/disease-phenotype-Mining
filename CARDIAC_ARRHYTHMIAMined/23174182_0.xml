<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, assessed the pregnancy outcomes in women who had received an autograft, homograft, or mechanical valve in the aortic position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women who were pregnant after surviving aortic valve replacement at our institution from 1987 to 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on cardiac status and pregnancy outcome was obtained through the hospital medical records and by an extensive patient questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 women experienced 67 pregnancies, of which 55 (82%) were completed pregnancies, 6 (9%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e>, and 6 (9%) were terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 40 women, 18 (45%) had a pulmonary autograft, 13 (32%) a homograft, and 9 (23%) a mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the first pregnancy was 30.0 Â± 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No maternal mortality but 1 fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.8%) and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> (1.8%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maternal cardiac complications developed in 13% and obstetric complications in 38% of the completed pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> (9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-related disorders (7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> (24%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>small-for-gestational-age infants</z:hpo> (15%) were most often encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mechanical valve recipients had the greatest incidence of both cardiac and obstetric complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pregnancy-associated complications after aortic valve replacement were common, and human tissue valves should be considered in the discussion for the optimal aortic valve substitute in a young woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, careful obstetric monitoring is mandatory </plain></SENT>
