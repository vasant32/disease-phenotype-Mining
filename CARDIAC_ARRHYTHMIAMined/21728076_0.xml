<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> could be more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 56 patients with RA were compared with 35 age- and gender-matched <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> subjects for <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> was defined as the presence of an additional R wave, or notching of the R or S wave, or the presence of fragmentation in 2 contiguous leads corresponding to the territory of a major coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with bundle block on ECG and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (37.5%) in the RA group had <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>, while two patients in the control group (5.7%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the groups in terms of age, gender, or drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of disease--years (interquartile range [IQR])--was 10 (8) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> (+) group, while it was 5 (2) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> (-) group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that duration of disease was associated with the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> (B = 1.5, odds ratio = 4.5, p = 0.004, 95% confidence interval = 1.6-12.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> on ECG was more common in patients with RA without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> than in age- and gender-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
