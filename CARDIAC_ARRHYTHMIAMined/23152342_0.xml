<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health (approximately 9 million <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a total of 53,930 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas' disease</z:e>, 44,543 (82.6%) as underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as associated cause </plain></SENT>
