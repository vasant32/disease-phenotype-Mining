<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of RDW on response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients (mean age, 57 ± 13 years; 42 men) undergoing CRT were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hematological parameters and echocardiographic parameters were measured before and 6 months after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An echocardiographic response to CRT was defined as a ≥15 % relative increase in left ventricular ejection fraction after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 6 months of CRT, 47 (71 %) patients were responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High baseline RDW levels were found in 11 (23 %) and 10 (52 %) patients in responders and non-responders, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-responders, RDW at 6 months was significantly high compared to baseline RDW (17.1 ± 2 vs. 19 ± 2.9) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was not any significant change in RDW after CRT in responders (16 ± 1.6 vs. 15.5 ± 1.4) (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, significant associates of response to CRT were evaluated adjusting for QRS width, QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, age, New York Heart Association functional class, hemoglobulin, and RDW level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline RDW level was the only predictor of response to CRT (odds ratio, 1.435; 95 % confidence interval, 1.059-1.945, p = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with elevated RDW at baseline are associated with poor response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, RDW at baseline could help to identify patients with response to CRT </plain></SENT>
