<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stress <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (SCM) is a syndrome of transient ventricular dysfunction triggered by severe emotional or physical stress, likely resulting from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-mediated myocardial toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Repolarization abnormalities associated with other hyperadrenergic states can cause QT prolongation and lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the development of repolarization abnormalities and QT prolongation in SCM, little is known about the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) and TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a cohort of patients with SCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from a registry of consecutive patients with SCM from 2 institutions were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> or TdP were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group of patients with SCM without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 93 patients with SCM, 8 (8.6%) experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 8 patients, 2 presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and were subsequently diagnosed with SCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six other patients experienced pause-dependent TdP or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> after SCM diagnosis in the setting of substantial QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.28 for each 10 ms increase in QTc, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SCM can be associated with life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in over 8% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SCM should be recognized among the causes of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and can be associated with a risk of TdP </plain></SENT>
