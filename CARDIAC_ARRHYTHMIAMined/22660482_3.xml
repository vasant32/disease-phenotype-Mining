<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the effects and mechanisms of I(to) on EAD genesis in cardiac cells using combined experimental and computational approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We first carried out patch-clamp experiments in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> (0.2 or 1 mM), in which EADs were induced at a slow pacing rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EADs were eliminated by either increasing the pacing rate or blocking I(to) with 2 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to enhancing the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and the late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> also increased the conductance, slowed inactivation, and accelerated recovery from the inactivation of I(to) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer simulations showed that I(to) promoted EADs under the condition of reduced repolarization reserve, consistent with the experimental observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, EADs were only promoted in the intermediate ranges of the I(to) conductance and the inactivation time constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanism is that I(to) lowers the AP plateau voltage into the range at which the time-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (namely I(Ks)) activation is further slowed and I(Ca,L) is available for reactivation, leading to voltage oscillations to manifest EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further experimental studies in cardiac cells of other species validated the theoretical predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In cardiac cells, I(to), with a proper conductance and inactivation speed, potentiates EADs by setting the AP plateau into the voltage range where I(Ca,L) reactivation is facilitated and I(Ks) activation is slowed </plain></SENT>
