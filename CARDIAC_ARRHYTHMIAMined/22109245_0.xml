<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare left ventricular (LV) volume indices and the ejection fraction (EF) obtained using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in unselected patients representative of 'real-world' clinical practice, and to determine the effect of RT3DE image quality on these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients undergoing CMR underwent same day RT3DE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LV volume and EF measurements were made using both modalities and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scans were independently analysed by a second observer to assess inter-observer variability, and 40% were re-analysed to assess intra-observer variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT3DE image quality was graded as good, adequate, and non-analysable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (22%) patients had good RT3DE image quality, 29 (48%) had adequate image quality, and 18 (30%) had image quality precluding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body mass index and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> frequency were higher in patients with suboptimal image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT3DE significantly underestimated end-diastolic volume (EDV) (-45 ± 35 mL, P &lt; 0.001), end-systolic volume (ESV) (-11 ± 24 mL, P = 0.004), and EF (-7 ± 9%, P &lt; 0.001) compared with CMR although the degree of underestimation was substantially less when image quality was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (18%) classified as having a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EF by CMR had a reduced EF according to RT3DE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of which had suboptimal image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Observer variability for RT3DE was higher than for CMR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters, however, the difference was not significant when RT3DE image quality was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously published data from highly selected patient groups, 'real-world' RT3DE substantially underestimates LV volumes and EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degree of underestimation is related to image quality </plain></SENT>
