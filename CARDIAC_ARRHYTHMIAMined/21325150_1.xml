<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Understanding variation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electric activity of the heart, assessed by the ECG, may provide a starting point for studies of susceptibility to serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent genetic association studies of one ECG trait, the QT interval, have identified common variation in European-descent populations, but little is known about the genetic determinants of ECG traits in populations of African descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify genetic risk factors, we have undertaken a candidate gene study of ECG traits in collaboration with the Jackson Heart Study, a longitudinal study of 5301 blacks ascertained from the Jackson, Mississippi, area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine quantitative ECG traits were evaluated: P, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc durations, heart rate, and P, QRS, and T axes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 72 variations in the predominant <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel gene expressed in heart, SCN5A, encoding the Na(v)1.5 voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel in 4558 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both rare and common variants in this gene have previously been associated with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes and variable conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for age, sex, and European ancestry, we performed tests of association in 3054 unrelated participants and identified 14 significant associations (P&lt;1.0Ã—10(-4)), of which 13 are independent, based on linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These variants explain up to 2% of the variation in ECG traits in the Jackson Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that SCN5A variation contributes to ECG trait distributions in blacks, and these same variations may be risk or protective factors associated with susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
