<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, psychological science has developed tools and models for understanding the mind and promoting well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional effort is needed to combine frameworks and techniques from these traditions to improve emotional experience and socioemotional behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An 8-week intensive (42 hr) meditation/emotion regulation training intervention was designed by experts in contemplative traditions and emotion science to reduce "destructive enactment of emotions" and enhance prosocial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were 82 healthy female schoolteachers who were randomly assigned to a training group or a wait-list control group, and assessed preassessment, postassessment, and 5 months after training completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessments included self-reports and experimental tasks to capture changes in emotional behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The training group reported reduced trait negative affect, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and increased trait positive affect and mindfulness compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On a series of behavioral tasks, the training increased recognition of emotions in others (Micro-Expression Training Tool), protected trainees from some of the psychophysiological effects of an experimental threat to self (Trier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871388" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Social Stress</z:e> Test; TSST), appeared to activate cognitive networks associated with compassion (lexical decision procedure), and affected hostile behavior in the Marital Interaction Task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most effects at postassessment that were examined at follow-up were maintained (excluding positive affect, TSST <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e>, and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that increased awareness of mental processes can influence emotional behavior, and they support the benefit of integrating contemplative theories/practices with psychological models and methods of emotion regulation </plain></SENT>
