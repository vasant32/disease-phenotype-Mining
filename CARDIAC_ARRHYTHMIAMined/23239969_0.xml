<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this research, we studied 145 patients after correction of TOF: 66 male, 79 women, 41 of which reported history of 68 pregnancies, means age 37±10 years, age at operation 7±8 years, mean duration of post-surgical follow-up 30±7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selected variables were compared according to sex and according to history of pregnancy with statistical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men had more severe hemodynamic impairment and a higher number of cardiac reoperations than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>41% of patients had at least one complication during pregnancy; there were 16 (67%) abortions and 39 (74%) Caesarian delivers; the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> was 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After pregnancy, there was a shift from first to second functional class: unique pregnancy determined no differences in term of morpho-functional ventricular features compared to nulliparous, but they complained <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and palpitation and echocardiographyc dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular dysfunction and QRS duration at ECG were independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were no gender-specific differences in patients operated on for TOF using ventriculotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy is an event in these patients at risk for the newborn, in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, and recurrence of birth defects, and for the mother in terms of ventricular dysfunction and electrical instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At least a single pregnancy does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of post-surgical patients operated on for TOF </plain></SENT>
