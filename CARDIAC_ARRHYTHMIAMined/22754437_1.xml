<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients scheduled for elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> inhalation anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously during intra- and post-operative 48 h periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of ischemic events and the cumulative duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in each patient were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood was sampled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for the determination of cTnI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up during their hospital stay for any adverse cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were comparable among the groups [16 (25%) patients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> group vs 24 (39%) patients in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group; P=0.126] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration, cumulative duration, and magnitude of ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of ischemic events in each patient were significantly less in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> group (P=0.008, 0.048, 0.038, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>cTnI levels of the overall population were significantly less in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> group vs <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group (P values &lt;0.0001) from 6 h postoperative and onward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, cTnI levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the ICU in patients who presented with ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> group than in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> group (P&lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001, 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients presented with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> either during ICU or hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with CAD receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> for peripheral vascular surgery had significantly lower release of cardiac troponin I at 6 h postoperatively and lasting for 48 h than patients receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> for the same procedure with significant decrease in duration, cumulative duration of ischemic events, and degree of ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in each patient </plain></SENT>
