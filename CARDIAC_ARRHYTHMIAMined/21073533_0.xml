<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Maintenance of an open sternotomy (OS) after a complicated cardiac operation is an adjunct in the treatment of the severely impaired heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, survival, and predictors of poor outcome for open chest management (OCM) with delayed sternal closure (DSC) at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prolonged open chest (OC) was used in 179 of 5122 cardiac surgery patients between 2004 and 2008 (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine indications, mortality, postoperative complications, and predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of OS was 3.5%, with 1.3% for isolated CABG, 2.4% for isolated valve, and 6.4% for combined procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for OS were: hemodynamic compromise (110), intractable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (19), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (14), and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or tamponade (36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>127 of the 179 patients with DSC (71%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>52 patients died: 20 before DSC and 32 after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality could be related to the indication for OS: With the indication "low cardiac output syndrome" (LCOS) the mortality was 34.5%, for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> it was 26.3%, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 21.4%, and for tamponade on closure it was 16.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After DSC, deep sternal wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> occurred in nine patients (5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282002" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superficial infection</z:e> in 4.7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 16 patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (8.9%) and 24 patients with need for dialysis (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Predictors of mortality by univariate analysis were VAD insertion, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemodialysis, reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, mean length of duration of OS (survivors 3.4 days, nonsurvivors 6.5 days), and longer duration of high-dose inotropic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that OCM with DSC is a beneficial, therapeutic option in patients with postoperative LCOS, significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, patients with reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, need for VAD, and particularly a prolonged delay before sternal closure continued to have a poor outcome.â€‚ </plain></SENT>
