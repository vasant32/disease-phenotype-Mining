<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The value of Nt-pro BNP in predicting AF complicating cardiac surgery is not well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to determine its predictive role in the occurrence of this complication after heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass METHODS: It is a prospective observational study including patients proposed for scheduled cardiac surgery with normo-thermal CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed blood samples for each patient: the first one immediately after the induction of anesthesia and before CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following samples were made at the end of the CBP (H0), 4 hours later (H4) and every day during the first four days (H24, H48, H72 and H96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP and cTnI were measured in each sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative AF was defined as any episode of AF documented of a period not less than 15 min recorded in the first 3 days post operative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common cardiovascular complication was the AF (17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rates of Nt-proBNP were significantly increased in patients who developed this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ROC analysis of NT-proBNP at different times studied for the prediction of AF showed that assays at the end of the CPB and those of the 4th postoperative hour (H4) had the best area under the curve (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A threshold value of 353.5 mg/mL of Nt-proBNP at the end of the CPB has a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 84% for the prediction of the AF and an AUC of 0.711 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The threshold value (307.5 mg/mL) of Nt-proBNP measured at H4 has the same sensitivity but with a lower specificity (74%) and AUC=0.709 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: An early Nt pro BNP at H0 or H4, respectively, and with thresholds of 353 and 307 pg/mL could predict the occurrence of the AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this case, a primary prevention could be envisaged </plain></SENT>
