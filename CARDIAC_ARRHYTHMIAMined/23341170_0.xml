<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Group-based developmental trajectory modeling was used to characterize RSA development patterns in 106 typically developing children across 5, 10, 24, 36, and 48 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A two-group model fit of RSA development was found: a "typically" and "atypically" developing group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The typical group gradually increased in RSA across 5-48 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The atypical group, however, increased in RSA from 5 to 24 months and demonstrated a plateau or "delay" in RSA development from 24 to 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The atypical RSA development group also demonstrated more difficulties in parent-reported social responsiveness at 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results support current literature that identifies RSA as a marker of social functioning level. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
