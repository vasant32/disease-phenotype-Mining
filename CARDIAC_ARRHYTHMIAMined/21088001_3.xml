<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the long-term outcome of patients undergoing anatomic GP ablation for paroxysmal AF, in comparison with circumferential pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 70 patients (mean age 56.6 ± 10.9 years; 41 males) with paroxysmal AF and no history of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>: 35 subjects underwent anatomic GP ablation, while 35 consecutive patients had circumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (CPVI) (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were not different in demographic and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomic GP ablation required more ablation points (85.6 ± 5.5 vs. 74.4 ± 6.2, P &lt; 0.05) and equal duration of total procedure and fluoroscopy times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 36.3 ± 2.3 months, freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia without antiarrhythmics was achieved in 34.3% patients after anatomic GP ablation and 65.7% patients after CPVI (log-rank test P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences and anatomic GP ablation were independent predictors of late recurrence [HR 6.44 (CI 95%; 3.14-13.18; P &lt; 0.001) and HR 2.08 (CI 95%; 1.03-4.22; P = 0.04), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients in the group of GP ablation underwent subsequent CPVI, plus peri-mitral flutter ablation in two of them, with no further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anatomic GP ablation yields a significantly lower success rate over the long-term follow-up period, when compared with CPVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrences include AF and macro re-entrant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
