<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>Pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> (PR) is a common complication of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction and leads to right ventricular (RV) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for evaluating PR and RV dysfunction, cost and limited availability are problems in many centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic predictors of these complications and optimize patient selection for their short-term follow-up by CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-four patients with a history of RVOT repair were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a clinical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography and CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QRS duration, indexed end-diastolic RV (EDRV) diameter and area on echocardiography were significantly associated with RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> on CMR (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal localization of Doppler PR flow was the strongest echocardiographic criterion associated with severe PR (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> history and high Tei index were significantly associated with low RV ejection fraction (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.017, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, grade of PR, QRS duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and valvulotomy were strongly associated with severe PR and RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> or systolic RV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these results, an approach based on a scaled scoring system for selecting patients who need short-term CMR evaluation and close follow-up was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method should avoid 31% of CMR examinations, with a sensitivity of 97.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic criteria can be used to accurately evaluate patients with RVOT repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of such features facilitates identification of patients who do or do not require close CMR evaluation </plain></SENT>
