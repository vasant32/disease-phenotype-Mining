<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the early outcomes, we analyzed our results to provide the intra- and postoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that multiple previous sternotomies do not influence the morbidity, mortality, or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent reoperative RVOT reconstruction at the University of Rochester Medical Center and SUNY Upstate Medical Center from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups based upon the number of previous sternotomies: Group 1 with one, Group 2 with two, and Group 3 with three or more previous sternotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 220 patients had reoperative RVOT reconstruction, 103 in Group 1, 71 in Group 2, and 46 in Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the percentage of inadvertent cardiotomy between groups (Group 1: 2%, Group 2: 1%, Group 3: 2%; P =.9) The number of previous sternotomies had no effect upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or the percentage of patients who received a red blood cell transfusion (Group 1: 56%, Group 2: 49% Group 3: 43%; P =.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perioperative mortality for the entire group was 3/220 (1.4%), with no difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 39 months, there was a survival of 98% for Groups 1 and 3 and 97% for Group 2 (P =.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reoperative RVOT reconstruction can safely be performed with limited morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of previous sternotomies does not influence the rate of cardiotomy, red blood cell transfusion, or early outcome </plain></SENT>
