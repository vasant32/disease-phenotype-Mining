<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The most efficacious surgical treatment for renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000843'>hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> is still subject of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering its low incidence rate of long-term relapse, "presumed" total parathyroidectomy without autotrasplantation (TP) may be indicated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000867'>secondary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> (2HPT) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD), not eligible for kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the TP long-term results in 2HPT haemodialysis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between January 2004 and October 2009, 25 2HPT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients, not eligible for kidney transplantation, underwent TP of at least four parathyroid glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels were assessed intraoperatively and during a 36-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TP improved the typical clinical symptoms and a significant reduction of iPTH serum levels was achieved in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aparathyroidism was never observed; in case of severe postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002199'>hypocalcemic seizures</z:hpo> were never reported and the long-term recurrence rate was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient received a kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cardiovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, peripheral artery disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, coronary or cerebrovascular disease) were observed in 32% of cases and mortality rate was 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considering its low long-term relapse rate and the absence of postoperative aparathyroidism, TP may still be considered the treatment of choice in patients with aggressive forms of 2HPT or of advanced dialytic vintage, with no access to renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In case of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000829'>hypoparathyroidism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcaemia</z:hpo> can be effectively managed by medical treatment </plain></SENT>
