<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although TNF-α mice have been studied extensively with a number of experimental methods, the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We created a mathematical model that reproduced experimentally observed changes in the action potential (AP) and Ca(2+) handling of isolated TNF-α mice ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the contribution of the differences in ion currents, AP, Ca(2+) handling, and intercellular coupling to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in TNF-α mice, we further created several multicellular model tissues with combinations of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT)/reduced gap junction conductance, WT/prolonged AP, and WT/decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Na)) amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> model tissues were examined for susceptibility to Ca(2+) alternans, AP propagation block, and reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our modeling results demonstrated that, similar to experimental data in TNF-α mice, Ca(2+) alternans in TNF-α tissues developed at longer basic cycle lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greater susceptibility to Ca(2+) alternans was attributed to the prolonged AP, resulting in larger inactivation of I(Na), and to the decreased SR Ca(2+) uptake and corresponding smaller SR Ca(2+) load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simulations demonstrated that AP prolongation induces an increased susceptibility to AP propagation block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Programmed stimulation of the model tissues with a premature impulse showed that reduced gap junction conduction increased the vulnerable window for initiation reentry, supporting the idea that reduced intercellular coupling is the major factor for reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in TNF-α mice </plain></SENT>
