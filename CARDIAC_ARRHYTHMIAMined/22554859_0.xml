<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to modulate atrial electrophysiology and confer protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SCS reduces the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) induced by tachypacing (TP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 21 canines, upper thoracic SCS systems and custom cardiac pacing systems were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right atrial and left atrial effective refractory periods were measured at baseline and after 15 minutes of SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following recovery in a subset of canines, pacemakers were turned on to induce AF by alternately delivering TP and searching for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Canines were randomized to no SCS therapy (CTL) or intermittent SCS therapy on the initiation of TP (EARLY) or after 8 weeks of TP (LATE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF burden (percent AF relative to total sense time) and AF inducibility (percentage of TP periods resulting in AF) were monitored weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 15 weeks, echocardiography and histology were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Effective refractory periods increased by 21 ± 14 ms (P = .001) in the left atrium and 29 ± 12 ms (P = .002) in the right atrium after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AF burden was reduced for 11 weeks in EARLY compared with CTL (P &lt;.05) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF inducibility remained lower by week 15 in EARLY compared with CTL animals (32% ± 10% vs 91% ± 6%; P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF burden and inducibility were not significantly different between LATE and CTL animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no structural differences among any groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SCS prolonged atrial effective refractory periods and reduced AF burden and inducibility in a canine AF model induced by TP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that SCS may represent a treatment option for AF </plain></SENT>
