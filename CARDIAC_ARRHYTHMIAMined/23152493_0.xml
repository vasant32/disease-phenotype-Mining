<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Most cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) are postulated to cause a distinctive form of Ca(2+) release dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering the spread distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mutations, we hypothesized that dysfunctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> also was feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which a novel RyR2-V2475F mutation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> in humans triggers Ca(2+)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in whole hearts and intact mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Recombinant channels harboring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-linked RyR2 mutations were functionally characterized using tritiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> binding and single-channel recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homologous recombination was used to generate a knock-in mouse bearing the RyR2-V2475F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular myocytes from mice heterozygous for the mutation (RyR2-V2475F(+/-)) and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates were Ca(2+)-imaged by confocal microscopy under conditions that mimic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The propensity of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice to have development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was tested at the whole heart level and in intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recombinant RyR2-V2475F channels displayed increased cytosolic Ca(2+) activation, abnormal protein kinase A phosphorylation, and increased activation by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RyR2-V2475F mutation appears embryonic-lethal in homozygous mice, but heterozygous mice have no alterations at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous Ca(2+) release events were more frequent and had shorter latency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-stimulated cardiomyocytes from RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts, but their threshold was unchanged with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adrenergically triggered tachyarrhythmias were more frequent in RyR2-V2475F(+/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mutation RyR2-V2475F is phenotypically strong among other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mutations and produces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> mechanisms of RyR2 dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In living mice, this mutation appears too severe to be harbored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> RyR2 channels but remains undetected under basal conditions if expressed at relatively low levels. Î²-adrenergic stimulation breaks the delicate Ca(2+) equilibrium of RyR2-V2475F(+/-) hearts and triggers life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
