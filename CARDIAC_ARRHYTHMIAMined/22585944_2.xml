<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> is associated with sympathovagal disbalance, AF, and postapneic BP rises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renal denervation (RDN) reduces renal efferent and possibly also afferent sympathetic activity and BP in resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of RDN compared with β-blockade by atenolol on atrial electrophysiological changes, AF inducibility, and BP during obstructive events and on shortening of atrial effective refractory period (AERP) induced by high-frequency stimulation of ganglionated plexi were investigated in 20 anesthetized pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tracheal occlusion with applied negative tracheal pressure (NTP; at -80 mbar) induced pronounced AERP shortening and increased AF inducibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RDN but not atenolol reduced NTP-induced AF-inducibility (20% versus 100% at baseline; P=0.0001) and attenuated NTP-induced AERP shortening more than atenolol (27±5 versus 43±3 ms after atenolol; P=0.0272) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> after RDN or atenolol completely inhibited NTP-induced AERP shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AERP shortening induced by high-frequency stimulation of ganglionated plexi was not influenced by RDN, suggesting that changes in sensitivity of ganglionated plexi do not play a role in the antiarrhythmic effect of RDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postapneic BP rise was inhibited by RDN and not modified by atenolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed that vagally mediated NTP-induced AERP shortening is modulated by RDN or atenolol, which emphasizes the importance of autonomic disbalance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo>-associated AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Renal denervation displays antiarrhythmic effects by reducing NTP-induced AERP shortening and inhibits postapneic BP rises associated with obstructive events </plain></SENT>
