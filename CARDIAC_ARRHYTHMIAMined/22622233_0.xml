<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This preclinical study was to investigate if cicletanine (CIC) could produce cardioprotective effects in conscious rabbits exhibiting the main symptoms of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NZW rabbits that had undergone an 8-week-long cholesterol-enriched diet (1.5%) were instrumented with a pacemaker electrode and randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the oral treatment of either CIC (50 mg·kg) or sotalol (25 mg·kg) and their placebo b.i.d. over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study groups were subjected to either "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> challenge" by programmed electrical stimulation in the "Arrhythmogenesis" study (N = 54) or global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> by rapid pacing in the "Ventricular Overdrive Pacing-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Myocardial Ischemia</z:e>" study (N = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic effect was evaluated by the establishment of the incidence of programmed electrical stimulation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proarrhythmia indicators (eg, QTc, Tpeak-Tend) were also measured to assess the cardiac safety profile of CIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the background of antiarrhythmic effect, cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> (cyclic 3',5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate [cGMP], cyclic 3',5'-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate [cAMP]) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> content were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The antiischemic effect was characterized by change of intracavital ST segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cicletanine treatment significantly decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, increased cardiac cGMP and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> content and reduced cardiac cAMP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cicletanine did not modify significantly QTc and Tpeak-Tend interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ST-segment change in response to rapid pacing was reduced significantly by CIC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cicletanine exerts beneficial cardiac effects in rabbits with symptoms of MS, which may be of influence with regard to the clinical application of the drug </plain></SENT>
