<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A comparison is made the end-tidal fractional concentration of carbon dioxide (FetCO2) and breathing frequency (f) obtained by capnography between 106 healthy persons (H-group) and 30 persons with a psychogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> (P-group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The structure of a respiratory cycle was estimated by parameter R(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was calculated by relation of time of an exhalation to time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respiratory cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degree of "breath <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>" was estimated by means of parameter CVR(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was the coefficient of variation (CV) for R(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) recorded during the 5-min capnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups was differed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters (p &lt; 0.01), except for R(CO)2 (structures of a respiratory cycle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FetCO2 at H-group was 5.24 +/- 0.36%, at P-group 4.07 +/- 0.47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The breathing frequency at H-group was 14.3 +/- 3.7 br/min, at P-group 17.9 +/- 4.5 and CVR(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>) at H-group was 8.9 +/- 2.7%, at P-group 12.7 +/- 3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the most informative indicator of a psychogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> is the complex of parameters taking into account <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three characteristics of a pattern of breath: decrease FetCO2, increase f, and rhythm of breath </plain></SENT>
