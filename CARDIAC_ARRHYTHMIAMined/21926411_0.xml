<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the identification of SND during AFL is difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether we could predict underlying SND in patients with persistent AFL using the flutter cycle length (FCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 211 successfully ablated patients with persistent cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent AFL and measured the FCL before the ablation and corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) after the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (11%) required a permanent pacemaker implantation (PMI) for significant SND after AFL termination and had a longer FCL (295 ± 37 vs. 236 ± 34 ms; P&lt; 0.0001) and greater CSNRT (1727 ± 1014 vs. 603 ± 733 ms; P&lt; 0.0001) than those not requiring a PMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A receiver-operating characteristic curve identified an FCL of &gt;273 ms as the optimal cut-off value for predicting SND requiring a PMI (area under the curve 0.91; sensitivity, 83% and specificity, 89%; P&lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (β = -0.2; P= 0.0016) and FCL (β = 0.46; P&lt; 0.0001) were independently associated with the CSNRT, and that females [odds ratio (OR), 2.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.32-4.62; P= 0.0046], an LVEF &lt; 50% (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.20-3.87; P= 0.012), and an FCL of &gt;273 ms (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 3.08-10.08; P&lt; 0.0001) were independent predictors of SND requiring a PMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although this study was based on a review of a database, the results suggest that assessing the FCL in patients with persistent CTI-dependent AFL could be helpful in the risk stratification of underlying SND </plain></SENT>
