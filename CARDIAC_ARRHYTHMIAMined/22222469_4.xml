<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Two preconditioning stimuli should induce a more consistent overall cell protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC, second preconditioning stimulus) applied during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> inhalation (first preconditioning stimulus) would provide more protection to the myocardium of patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this placebo-controlled randomized controlled study, patients in the RIPC group received four 5-min cycles of 300 mmHg cuff inflation/deflation of the leg before aortic cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia consisted of opioids and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> for induction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> for maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were plasma levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, S100 protein, and short- and long-term clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiles were obtained from atrial tissue using microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RIPC (n = 27) did not reduce high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T release when compared with placebo (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, a marker of myocardial dysfunction; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a marker of perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp>; and S100, a marker of cerebral injury, were not different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence for the perioperative composite endpoint combining new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> was higher in the RIPC group than the placebo group (14/27 vs. 6/28, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in the 6-month cardiovascular outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> release correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-induced transcriptional changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35366">fatty-acid</z:chebi> metabolism (P = 0.001) and DNA-damage signaling (P &lt; 0.001), but not with RIPC-induced changes in gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RIPC applied during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> inhalation provides no benefit to the myocardium of patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
