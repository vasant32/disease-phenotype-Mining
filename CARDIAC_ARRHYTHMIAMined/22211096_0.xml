<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo> associated with cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess ECG findings of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND MATERIALS: Sixty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> (34 male, mean age 58Â±11 years) and 60 age and gender-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the 12-lead surface ECG, P-wave and both conventional QT measurements and transmyocardial repolarization parameters (T(peak)-T(end) interval (T(p)-T(e)) and derivatives) were evaluated digitally by two experienced cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a novel parameter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> was calculated digitally as the standard deviation of the P-wave duration across the 12 ECG leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QT duration and corrected QT interval were significantly longer in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group compared to healthy controls (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The T(p)-T(e) was longer and the T(p)-T(e)/QT ratio was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P-wave analyses showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P-wave parameters including Pmax, Pmin, P dispersion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> were significantly prolonged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> patients compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase of both T(p)-T(e )and P max in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> group was independent of age, BMI, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, gender, systolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, hematocrit, left atrial dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and early deceleration time in a univariate analysis of co-variance model (F=11.097, p=0.001 and F=31.537, p=0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> may be associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities of both atrium and ventricle </plain></SENT>
