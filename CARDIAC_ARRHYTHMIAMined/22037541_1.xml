<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and mid-term outcome of transvenous CS lead reimplantation in a tertiary referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were referred to our hospital for CS lead removal from December 2000 through to May 2009 and were transvenously reimplanted with a CRT system before June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One-year follow-up was performed to evaluate the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, malfunctions, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 113 consecutive patients undergoing successful CS lead extraction; 90 patients (75 male, mean age 69.2, range 35-84) underwent CS lead reimplantation (success rate: 95.6%; right-sided approach: 64.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, cardiac device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the usual indication for extraction (74.4%) and the subsequent reimplantation was performed after a median time of 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coronary sinus lead was usually positioned in the left ventricular (LV) postero-lateral region (62.2%); two procedures were required in two cases (2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Balloon angioplasty was necessary for two patients (failure in one), whereas for the others we used a conventional implant technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, we observed four cases (4.4%) of local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and six cases (6.7%) of system malfunction, requiring reintervention (two cases during the same hospitalization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-year mortality was 5.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left ventricular lead reimplantation is in our experience an effective and safe procedure, also in the case of right-sided approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 1-year mortality was particularly low, whereas overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was higher than first implant procedures </plain></SENT>
