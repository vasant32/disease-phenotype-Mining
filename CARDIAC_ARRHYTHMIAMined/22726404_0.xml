<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective chart review of 69 consecutive patients over ten years assessed the clinical profile and surgical outcome of VH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age: 3 years; median weight: 15kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by echocardiography supplemented with blood smear (Howell Jolly bodies), Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) angiogram and/or surgical inspection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In right isomerism (RI) group (n=32), 12 patients did not undergo surgery, five had Blalock Taussig shunt, 14 had bidirectional Glenn and one had Fontan completion, with surgical mortality of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In left isomerism (LI) group (n=31), 11 patients underwent two ventricle repair (35%) and 15 (48%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> repair, with surgical mortality of 3.8%; five did not have surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow up (median period 1.5 years), 33% of un-operated patients and 25% of operated patients died, mortality being higher for RI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: VH can be diagnosed by imaging based criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VH tends to present late in the developing world with a significant percentage inoperable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LI had better surgical outcome and higher long term survival </plain></SENT>
