<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This includes using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35717">sedative drugs</z:chebi> that may be associated with side effects and complications that can lead to crisis situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study postulated that teaching medical crisis management to dental residents and assistants using human patient simulation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>) would improve their confidence in managing crisis situations in the real world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four medical crisis scenarios were designed and programmed into a pediatric simulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scenarios included <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngospasm</z:e> during procedural sedation, sedative medication overdose, and multiple drug interaction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The simulation room was outfitted with an authentic dental operatory and emergency equipment to enhance the realism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One first-or second-year pediatric dentistry resident and a staff dental assistant were assigned as a team to participate in each ten-minute scenario followed by a debriefing session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the sessions, the participants completed an anonymous survey regarding the simulation experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were a total of twenty-four participants, 91.7 percent of whom felt that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> was a good tool for learning medical crisis and that they will be more confident in managing a similar situation in the dental office after this experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A majority of the participants felt that using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> as a tool to teach crisis management is an acceptable and valuable technique to help improve their confidence in managing crisis situations that may occur in dental offices </plain></SENT>
