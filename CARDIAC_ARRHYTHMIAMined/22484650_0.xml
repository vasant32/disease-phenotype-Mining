<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether APC characteristics alter with progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the APC characteristics in terms of burden and relative coupling interval with progression of the AF disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with pAF, 50 consecutive patients with persistent AF (perAF), and 25 age-matched controls underwent clinical review, transthoracic echocardiography, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After excluding 29 patients who had AF for the entire recording (n = 24) or unreliable recordings (n = 5), we analyzed data from 49 patients with pAF, 24 patients with perAF, and 23 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> R-R intervals with a &gt;25% decrease in R-R coupling compared with the previous R-R interval (coupling interval index) were deemed APCs (n = 95,873) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median APC burden was higher in patients with pAF (2 [1-22] APCs/h; P = .004) and perAF (3 [1-6] APCs/h; P = .04) than in controls (1 [0-1] APCs/h) but was not different (P = .66) between the AF subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with pAF had a distinct increase in ectopy burden after 7 PM and elevation throughout the night (P = .002) in comparison with a blunted and complementary temporal response in the perAF cohort (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with pAF demonstrated a greater proportion of shortly coupled APCs (29% [13-45]; P = .04) compared with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (17% [5-29]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: "Real-life" atrial trigger statistics of APC burden, timing, and diurnal rhythms track the transition from a trigger-based, autonomically sensitive paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> to a more substrate-based persistent disease </plain></SENT>
