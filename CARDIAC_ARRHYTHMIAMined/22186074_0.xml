<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few is known about its use in our practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work aims to report its outcomes over a ten-year period in Abidjan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: One thousand, three hundred and ninety one charts of arrhythmic patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardioversion was attempted in 102 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and eighty one shocks were delivered with a mean energy of 262, 1 joules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success occurred in 84 patients (82,3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardioversion failed in 18 patients mostly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight serious complications (7,8%) occurred including 1 sinus node dysfunction, 1 pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100608'>metrorrhagia</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> died of end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and aftermath of a mitral valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direct current cardioversion is effective and safe in our practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications are predominantly due to the medical environment such as antiarrhythmic drugs use or clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
