<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The identification and analysis of several cationic ion channels and their associated genes have greatly improved our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective in this study was to examine the involvement of anionic ion channels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the human cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used RNase protection and in situ hybridization assays to determine the level of CFTR expression, and radiotelemetry and in vivo electrophysiological study in combination with pharmacological intervention to analyse the cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac CFTR overexpression leads to stress-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo intracardiac electrophysiological studies performed in anaesthetized mice showed no significant differences in baseline conduction parameters including atrial-His bundle (AH) or His bundle-ventricular (HV) conduction intervals, atrioventricular (AV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> or 2:1 <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> cycle length and AV nodal functional refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> administration, there was marked slowing of conduction parameters, including high-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in transgenic mice, with non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> easily inducible using programmed stimulation or burst pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> mouse model can be a valuable tool for investigation of the role of <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> channels in arrhythmogenesis and, potentially, for future evaluation of novel anti-arrhythmic therapeutic strategies and pharmacological agents </plain></SENT>
