<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is therefore critical to couple ion transport processes to the metabolic state of the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important player in this coupling appears to be the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This kinase becomes activated during conditions of cellular metabolic stress and is well-known for its role in promoting ATP-generating catabolic pathways while turning off ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade AMPK has also emerged as a key regulator of ion channel activity as an increasing number of ion channels are reported to be either directly or indirectly regulated by the kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AMPK therefore provides a necessary link between cellular energy levels and ion channel activity </plain></SENT>
