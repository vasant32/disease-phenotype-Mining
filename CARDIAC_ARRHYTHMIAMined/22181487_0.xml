<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Scroll waves are prominent patterns formed in three-dimensional excitable media, and they are frequently considered highly relevant for some types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimentally, scroll wave dynamics is often studied by optical tomography in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which produces <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> as an undesired product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Addition of small concentrations of a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35195">surfactant</z:chebi> to the reaction medium is a popular method to suppress or retard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> bubble formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that in closed reactors even these low concentrations of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="35195">surfactants</z:chebi> are sufficient to generate vertical gradients of excitability which are due to gradients in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In reactors open to the atmosphere such gradients can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gradients induce a twist on vertically oriented scroll waves, while a twist is absent in scroll waves in a gradient-free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> gradients are reproduced by a numerical study, where we extend the Oregonator model to account for the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> and for its advection against the direction of gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numerical simulations confirm the role of solubilized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> as the source of the vertical gradient of excitability in reactors closed to the atmosphere </plain></SENT>
