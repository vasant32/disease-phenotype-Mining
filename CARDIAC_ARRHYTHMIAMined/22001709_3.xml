<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the safety and the effect on the hospital length of stay of a new standardized protocol for perioperative management of OAC in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The new standardized protocol classified patients according to a renewed evaluation of their thromboembolic (TE) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Briefly, patients were considered at moderate-to-high TE risk if they had a mechanical valvular prostheses irrespective of type and location or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> associated with a CHADS(2)score of ≥2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and underwent device implantation without stopping OAC (OAC continued, n = 129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete interruption of OAC before surgery was performed in low-TE-risk patients (OAC interrupted, n = 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cohort of patients managed with a classic <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-bridging strategy served as a control group, with 62 patients considered at moderate-to-high TE risk according to previous guidelines (receiving pre- and postoperative low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) and 146 considered at low TE risk (receiving only low doses of postoperative low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TE events were comparable between the 2 strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients entering the new standardized protocol had significantly lower rates of pocket <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (2.3% for OAC continued vs 17.7% for moderate-to-high TE risk bridging controls, P = .0001, and 0% for OAC interrupted vs 13% for low-TE-risk bridging controls, P &lt;.0001) and shorter hospital stays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A mean of 3.34 hospitalization days per patient were saved with the new standardized protocol, with an estimated cost savings of €850.83 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the new standardized protocol resulted in a significant reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications and hospital stays, with adequate protection against TE events and significant cost savings </plain></SENT>
