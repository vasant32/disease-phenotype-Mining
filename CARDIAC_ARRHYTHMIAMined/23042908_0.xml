<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recessively inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein deficiency</z:e> and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, CASQ2 knockout (KO) mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls underwent echocardiography and heart rhythm telemetry before and after 6 wk of training by treadmill exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure gene and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular fractional shortening was impaired in KO (33 ± 5 vs. 51 ± 7% in controls, P &lt; 0.05) and improved after training (43 ± 12 and 51 ± 9% in KO and control mice, respectively, P = nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The exercise tolerance was low in KO mice (16 ± 1 vs. 29 ± 2 min in controls, P &lt; 0.01), but improved in trained animals (26 ± 2 vs. 30 ± 3 min, P = nonsignificant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hearts of KO mice had a higher basal expression of the brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After training, the expression of natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> genes markedly decreased, with no difference between KO and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exercise training was not associated with a change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> prevalence, but appeared to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> load, as manifested by a decrease in ventricular beats during stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in KO mice, which recapitulate the phenotype of human CPVT2, exercise training is well tolerated and could offer a strategy for heart conditioning against stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
