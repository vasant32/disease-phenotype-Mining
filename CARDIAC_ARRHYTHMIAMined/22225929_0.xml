<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially ventricular tachyarrhythmias are an important public health problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion (QTd), defined as the difference between maximal and minimal QT intervals, reflects the regional inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization dispersion and may mark the presence of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the effects of Pranayama (breathing exercise) on QTd in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and ejection fractions &lt;40% (mean = 28 ± 9%) who were on a stable medical regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: Standardized 12-lead surface ECGs were obtained at the beginning and end of the Pranayama session, and QT and JT intervals were measured manually and corrected for heart rate by using Bazett's formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QTd, heart rate-corrected QTd (QTc-d), JT dispersion (JTd), and heart ratecorrected JTd (JTc-d) were measured in at least eight ECG leads in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following the Pranayama session, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> had only slight improvements in exercise capacity (results were not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, these patients had marked improvements in QTd (71 ± 11 to 59 ± 17 ms; P &lt; .02), QTc-d (82 ± 28 to 63 ± 17 ms; P &lt; .01), JTd (76 ± 19 to 57 ± 18 ms; P &lt; .002), and JTc-d (84 ± 23 to 61 ± 18 ms; P &lt; .001) following the Pranayama session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate that Pranayama significantly reduces the indices of ventricular repolarization dispersion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate how effectively this reduction in ventricular repolarization dispersion decreases the risk of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
