<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human mutations in or variants of TBX20 are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> in patients with these conditions results from an embryonic or ongoing requirement for Tbx20 in myocardium, we ablated Tbx20 specifically in adult cardiomyocytes in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This ablation resulted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ensuing within 1 to 2 weeks of Tbx20 ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accounting for this dramatic phenotype, we identified molecular signatures that posit Tbx20 as a central integrator of a genetic program that maintains cardiomyocyte function in the adult heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of a number of genes encoding critical transcription factors, ion channels, and cytoskeletal/myofibrillar proteins was downregulated consequent to loss of Tbx20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide ChIP analysis of Tbx20-binding regions in the adult heart revealed that many of these genes were direct downstream targets of Tbx20 and uncovered a previously undescribed DNA-binding site for Tbx20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics and in vivo functional analyses revealed a cohort of transcription factors that, working with Tbx20, integrated multiple environmental signals to maintain ion channel gene expression in the adult heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data provide insight into the mechanisms by which mutations in TBX20 cause adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
