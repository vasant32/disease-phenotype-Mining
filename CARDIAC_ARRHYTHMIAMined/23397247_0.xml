<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Clinical trials have established that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) catheter ablation improves symptoms in appropriately selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of these results by long-term prospective observational studies is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This registry was created to describe the experience of 16 Italian centers with a large cohort of AF patients treated with catheter ablation guided by the NavX 3D mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 2006 to May 2008, 545 consecutive patients (age 60.4 ± 9.8, 67 % male) with paroxysmal (44 %), persistent (43 %), and long-standing persistent (13 %) AF referred for catheter ablation guided by the NavX system, were included in this registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this paper, follow-up was censored at 24 months; however, patients are being followed in the ongoing registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before the ablation, 80 % of patients failed to respond to at least one antiarrhythmic drug aimed at rhythm control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation guided by a circular mapping catheter was performed in 70��% of patients whereas non potential-guided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> encircling was performed in 30 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 67 % of patients, additional left atrial (LA) substrate modification was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Image integration was performed in 9.2 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering a 3-month blanking period, after a single-ablation procedure, the patients had 1- and 2-year freedom from AF recurrence of 67.4 and 57.0 % (36.1 % off antiarrhythmic drugs), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis showed that AF recurrences during blanking (HR 2.1), and previous AF ablation (HR 3.3) were independent predictors of AF recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major procedure-related complications occurred in 53 patients (9.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients (6.7 %), a repeat procedure was performed at a median of 5 months after the initial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multicenter clinical experience provides significant insights into current ablation care of patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite favorable outcomes, real-world complication rates appear higher than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
