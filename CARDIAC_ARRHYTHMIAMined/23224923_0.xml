<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicenter study based on a wide source of data incoming from 50 Intensive Care Units in Spain during 15 years, from April 1996 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, etiological and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables were collected before pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type of intervention, electrical measurement at implantation, model and serial number of devices and electrodes as well as early complications (before hospital discharge) were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During this period 31766 interventions have been reported: 24643 first implants (77.6%) and 7123 replacements (22.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of patients is lower than interventions because some of them were included as first implants and as replacements after years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In first implant the average age, clinical signs, ECG disorders and pacing modes were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data collected in device replacement interventions were average age, pacing modes and cause for replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>45% of implanted devices were endowed with rate control algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In last 3 years increased to 82.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From 1996 to 2010 we have seen a decline in VVI(R) pacing mode in favor to <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>(R) mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AAI(R) and VDD(R) modes have remained invariable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show data on early complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MAMI registration is a valid tool for recording the activity of pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It showed variations and trends of pacing modes and algorithms along the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Data is recorded separately for men and women so they can be compared </plain></SENT>
