<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics and mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) are well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known about the site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine if <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) have a predominant site of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> episodes of LQTS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> recorded in two university hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with LQTS and no structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, for whom simultaneous 6-12 leads ECG recording of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of TdP was available, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The site of origin of TDP was defined according to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the initiating ventricular complex based on validated criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple-lead recordings of 1025 LQTS-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including 151 episodes of TdP and 874 QT-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> (impending TdP) were available for 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The site of origin of TdP was not homogeneously distributed (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Instead, the majority of episodes of TdP (56%) and most QT-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> (70%) originated from the outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between site of origin and the aetiology of LQTS or the QT duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On a given patient, multiple episodes of TdP tended to originate from the same area and the site of origin of QT-related <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> correlated with the site of origin of TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most frequent site of origin of TdP is the outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to understand why this relatively small area of the ventricle is a predominant site of origin of diverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
