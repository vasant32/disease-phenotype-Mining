<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The unborn healthy foetus is looked upon as a blessing by one and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of thoughts arise in the brains of expectant parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But what goes on in the brain of the yet unborn still remains a mystery. 'Foetal mind' is a reflection of functions of its organs of sense, an instrument of knowledge that may even be reduced to machine to demonstrate the effect of sense organs and brain contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testimony to this fact are the various waveform patterns obtained non-invasively from the foetal Middle Cerebral Artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) by using Colour Doppler Ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study, conducted for evaluating the foetal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in a rural obstetric population in Maharashtra, India, explains how the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> - a major artery supplying foetal brain, can give abundant information about foetal heart and foetal stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When only the foetal heart is stressed by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or ectopic beats, these changes are manifest in the foetal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity waveform pattern as seen on Colour Doppler study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the entire foetus is under stress, as in cases of intra uterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> (IUGR), changes again manifest in the foetal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity waveform pattern and are designated as the foetal Brain Sparing Effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus scientific evaluation of foetal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> waveform can objectively demonstrate that the overtly non-communicating foetal brain indeed remains an internal organ of sense and a vital instrument of knowledge to clarify the various effects of sense organs and brain contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the brain parenchyma or cerebral metabolism has not been studied here, cerebral vessels serve as a window to cerebral metabolism, as auto regulatory function of brain leads to changes in haemodynamics of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, like other vessels, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mirrors <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015930" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">foetal distress</z:e> and IUGR; but unlike other vessels, e.g. the umbilical or uterine artery, which show these changes in the form of reduction or even reversal of diastolic flow, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> shows an increase in diastolic component due to brain sparing effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The unique connection between physical changes in the foetal heart, brain and mental operations are thus critically clarified to some extent, and this helps untangle and comprehend the lattice of mental operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although this preliminary study has its limitations, it still carries forward the present corpus of knowledge on the strength of its evidential and critical enquiry and helps unravel the concept of foetal consciousness </plain></SENT>
