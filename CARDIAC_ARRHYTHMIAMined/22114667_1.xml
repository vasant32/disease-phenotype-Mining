<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A standard protocol for spiral wave initiation is the application of a stimulus in the refractory tail of a propagating excitation wave, a region that we call the "classical vulnerable zone." Previous studies of vulnerability to spiral wave initiation did not take the influence of deformation into account, which has been shown to have a substantial effect on the excitation process of cardiomyocytes via the mechano-electrical feedback phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work we study the effect of deformation on the vulnerability of excitable media in a discrete reaction-diffusion-mechanics (dRDM) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dRDM model combines FitzHugh-Nagumo type equations for cardiac excitation with a discrete mechanical description of a finite-elastic isotropic material (Seth material) to model cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and stretch activated depolarizing current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that deformation alters the "classical," and forms a new vulnerable zone at longer coupling intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mechanically caused vulnerable zone results in a new mechanism of spiral wave initiation, where unidirectional conduction block and rotation directions of the consequently initiated spiral waves are opposite compared to the mechanism of spiral wave initiation due to the "classical vulnerable zone." We show that this new mechanism of spiral wave initiation can naturally occur in situations that involve wave fronts with curvature, and discuss its relation to supernormal excitability of cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The concept of mechanically induced vulnerability may lead to a better understanding about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of dangerous heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> via mechano-electrical feedback </plain></SENT>
