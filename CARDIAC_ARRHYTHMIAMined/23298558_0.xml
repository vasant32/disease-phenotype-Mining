<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neurohormones (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29341">NHs</z:chebi>) in the cascade of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system have drawn particular attention in the recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Copeptin, the C-terminal portion of provasopressin, is a novel NH of the AVP system, and is known to be co-released with AVP from hypothalamus (neurohypophysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a surrogate marker of the AVP system, copeptin has gradually replaced AVP in several clinical studies largely due to its structural and methodological advantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Copeptin has been regarded as a marker of non-specific stress response, and has also been suggested to have clinical implications in a variety of non-cardiovascular (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, etc.) and cardiovascular conditions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACSs, etc.)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, current data on relation of copeptin with other cardiovascular conditions ( <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, etc.) are still insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present review primarily focuses on general features of copeptin, its general clinical implications, and specifically aims to cover its potential clinical value in a variety of cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
