<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Baffle leaks and obstruction are present in 20% of Mustard survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical reintervention is associated with high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of percutaneous interventions performed at three adult congenital catheterization programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 26 catheterizations and 29 interventions were performed in 22 patients (mean age 32.4 ± 8.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous laser pacemaker lead extraction was successful in seven of seven procedures where the lead was at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stent placement was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 patients with systemic venous baffle (SVB) obstruction (mean gradient: 6.2 ± 3.4-0.6 ± 1.0 mm Hg; P &lt; 0.01, narrowest diameter 4.5 ± 4.5-17.1 ± 3.9 mm; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Balloon angioplasty was performed in two patients for pulmonary venous baffle (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53285">PVB</z:chebi>) obstruction with mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baffle leak interventions included device occlusion (n = 6), coil occlusion (n = 1), and covered stent occlusion (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postprocedural residual leaks were demonstrated in three of eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two of the three the residual leak was not appreciable at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced leak or obstruction related symptom recurrence (mean follow-up: 33.4 ± 29.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Complications included one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> 2 days after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53285">PVB</z:chebi> angioplasty and device related inferior SVB obstruction with resolution following stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent placement for SVB obstruction following Mustard repair is effective and likely safer than surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Baffle leak occlusion can be safely accomplished but residual leaks are common in the short term </plain></SENT>
