<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter is associated with significant morbidity, higher long-term mortality, and increased health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Novel preventive therapies are clearly needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiments and short-term trials, seafood-derived long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) influence several risk factors that might reduce risk of PoAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few small and generally underpowered trials have evaluated effects of ω-3-PUFAs supplementation on PoAF with mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The OPERA trial is an appropriately powered, investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial to determine whether perioperative oral ω-3-PUFAs reduces occurrence of PoAF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional aims include evaluation of resource use, biologic pathways and mechanisms, postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo>, and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Broad inclusion criteria encompass a "real-world" population of outpatients and inpatients scheduled for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment comprises a total preoperative loading dose of 8 to 10 g of ω-3-PUFAs or placebo divided over 2 to 5 days, followed by 2 g/d until hospital discharge or postoperative day 10, whichever comes first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on anticipated 30% event rate in controls, total enrollment of 1,516 patients (758 per treatment arm) will provide 90% power to detect 25% reduction in PoAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The OPERA trial will provide invaluable evidence to inform biologic pathways; proof of concept that ω-3-PUFAs influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>; and potential regulatory standards and clinical use of this simple, inexpensive, and low-risk intervention to prevent PoAF </plain></SENT>
