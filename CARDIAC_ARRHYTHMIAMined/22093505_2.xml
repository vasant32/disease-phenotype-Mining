<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> can manifest as either type 2 or type 3 pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter should be distinguished from incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>, present in 3% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with either type 2 or type 3 Brugada pattern that were referred for an antiarrhythmic drug challenge (AAD) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before AAD, 2 angles were measured from ECG leads V(1) and/or V(2) showing incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>: 1) α, the angle between a vertical line and the downslope of the r'-wave, and 2) β, the angle between the upslope of the S-wave and the downslope of the r'-wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline angle values, alone or combined with QRS duration, were compared between patients with negative and positive results on AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to identify optimal discriminative cutoff values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean β angle was significantly smaller in the 14 patients with negative results on AAD compared to the 24 patients with positive results on AAD (36 ± 20° vs. 62 ± 20°, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its optimal cutoff value was 58°, which yielded a positive predictive value of 73% and a negative predictive value of 87% for conversion to type 1 pattern on AAD; α was slightly less sensitive and specific compared with β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the angles were combined with QRS duration, it tended to improve discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, simple ECG criteria can enable discrimination between incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> and types 2 and 3 Brugada patterns </plain></SENT>
