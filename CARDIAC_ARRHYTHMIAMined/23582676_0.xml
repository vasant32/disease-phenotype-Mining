<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared conventional testing with prolonged monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (ILR) following the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> episode in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and negative workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> evaluation strategies-primary use of an ILR (Group 1) versus conventional testing (Group 2)-and to estimate the prevalence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the ILR patient subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2010, 78 patients admitted after one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> episode were randomized to ILR (n=41) or conventional follow-up (n=37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 27±12months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 76±8years and 30 patients were women (38.5%); 18 presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (23%) and 12 had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (15.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 56.5±11% and mean His-to-ventricle interval was 55±6ms based on negative electrophysiological study (EPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram abnormalities involved: 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch blocks</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBBs</z:chebi>); 11 right <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBBs</z:chebi>; and 33 bifascicular blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 21 patients (27%) developed significant arrhythmic events: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (n=1; 1.3%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (n=2; 2.6%); third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (n=14; 18%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (n=4; 5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 19 (24.4%) patients, relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected, with a significant difference between the ILR group (n=15/41; 36.6%) and the conventional follow-up group (n=4/37; 10.8%) (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were implanted with pacemakers; one received an implantable defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No predictors of <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> were identified in the ILR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized prospective study, the ILR strategy proved largely superior to conventional follow-up in detecting recurrent events, with a potential impact on therapeutic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This observation highlights the usefulness of early monitoring in patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> and negative EPS even after the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> episode but an empiric pacemaker strategy remains to be validated in this selected population </plain></SENT>
