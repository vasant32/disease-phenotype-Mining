<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a missense mutation in the DES gene coding for desmin, the intermediate filament protein expressed by cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, has been recently associated with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened 91 ARVC index cases (53 negative for mutations in desmosomal genes and an additional 38 carrying desmosomal gene mutations) for DES mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two rare missense variants were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous p.K241E substitution was detected in 1 patient affected with a severe form of ARVC who also carried the p.T816RfsX10 mutation in plakophilin-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This DES substitution, showing an allele frequency of &lt;0.01 in the control population, is predicted to cause an intolerant amino acid change in a highly conserved protein domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it can be considered a rare variant with a possible modifier effect on the phenotypic expression of the concomitant mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The previously known p.A213V substitution was identified in 1 patient with ARVC who was negative for mutations in the desmosomal genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because a greater prevalence of p.A213V has been reported in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004937'>heart dilation</z:mp> than in control subjects, the hypothesis that this rare variant could have an unfavorable effect on cardiac remodeling cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data help to establish that, in the absence of skeletal muscle involvement suggestive of a desminopathy, the probability of DES mutations in ARVC is very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings have important implications in the mutation screening strategy for patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
