<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Digitalis-like compounds (DLCs), or cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi>, are produced and sequestered by certain plants and animals as a protective mechanism against herbivores or predators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, the DLCs digoxin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi> are used in the treatment of cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and some types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, despite a very narrow therapeutic index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp; ABCB1) is the only known ATP-dependent efflux transporter that handles digoxin as a substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten alanine mutants of human P-gp drug-binding amino acids-Leu(65), Ile(306), Phe(336), Ile(340), Phe(343), Phe(728), Phe(942), Thr(945), Leu(975), and Val(982)-were generated and expressed in HEK293 cells with a mammalian baculovirus system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The uptake of [(3)H]-N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> (NMQ), the P-gp substrate in vesicular transport assays, was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutations I306A, F343A, F728A, T945A, and L975A abolished NMQ transport activity of P-gp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the other mutants, the apparent affinities for six DLCs (cymarin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi>, digoxin, peruvoside, proscillaridin A, and strophanthidol) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The affinities of digoxin, proscillaridin A, peruvoside, and cymarin for mutants F336A and I340A were decreased two- to fourfold compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>, whereas that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi> and strophanthidol did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of a <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> group at position 12β seems to reduce the apparent affinity when the side chain of Phe(336) and Phe(942) is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that a δ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52938">lactone ring</z:chebi> and a sugar moiety at 3β of the steroid body are favorable for DLC binding to P-gp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DLC inhibition is increased by <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> groups at positions 5β and 19, whereas inhibition is decreased by those at positions 1β, 11α, 12β, and 16β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The understanding of the P-gp-DLC interaction improves our insight into DLCs toxicity and might enhance the replacement of digoxin with other DLCs that have less adverse drug effects </plain></SENT>
