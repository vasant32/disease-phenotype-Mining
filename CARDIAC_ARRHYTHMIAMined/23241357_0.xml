<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the contribution of JNK to AF remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assessed the role of JNK in remodelling of gap junction connexin43 (Cx43) and development of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: AF induction, optical mapping, and biochemical assays were performed in young and aged New Zealand white rabbit left atria (LA) and cultured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 atrial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In aged rabbit LA, pacing-induced atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were dramatically increased and conduction velocity (CV) was significantly slower compared with young controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aged rabbit LA contained 120% more activated JNK and 54% less Cx43 than young LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Young rabbits treated with JNK activator anisomycin also exhibited increased pacing-induced atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reduced Cx43 (by 34%), similar to that found in aged LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cell cultures, anisomycin treatment for 16 h led to 42% reduction in Cx43, 24% reduction in CV, and an increased incidence of irregular rapid spontaneous activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were prevented by a specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a 63% reduction in Cx43 after anisomycin treatment for 24 h led to further slowed CV (by 41%) along with dramatically increased irregular rapid spontaneous activity and highly discontinuous conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These JNK-induced functional abnormalities were completely reversed by overexpressed exogenous <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Cx43, but not by inactive Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: JNK activation contributes to Cx43 reductions that promote development of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Modulation of JNK may be a potential novel therapeutic approach to prevent and treat AF </plain></SENT>
