<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation is increasingly used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study the natural history and long-term outcomes of ablated AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed 831 patients after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) performed in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We documented clinical outcomes using our prospective AF registry with most recent update on this group of patients in October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first year after ablation, 23.8% had early recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over long-term follow-up (55 months), only 8.9% had late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence defined as occurring beyond the first year after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeat ablations in patients with late recurrence revealed conduction recovery in at least 1 of the previously isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them and right-sided triggers with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> testing in 55.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, clinical improvement was 89.9% (79.4% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free off antiarrhythmic drugs and 10.5% with AF controlled with antiarrhythmic drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 4.6% continued to have drug-resistant AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was possible to safely discontinue anticoagulation in a substantial proportion of patients with no recurrence in the year after ablation (CHADS score â‰¤2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence of 0.06% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure-related complication rate was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein isolation is safe and efficacious for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm and control of symptoms in patients with drug-resistant AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It obviates the need for antiarrhythmic drugs, negative dromotropic agents, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> in a substantial proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
