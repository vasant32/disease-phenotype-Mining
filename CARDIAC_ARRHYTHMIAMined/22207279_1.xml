<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> study, evaluating the response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with a narrow QRS to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ESTEEM-CRT was a multi-center, single-arm, feasibility study that evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-indicated, medically-optimized patients with EF ≤ 35%, NYHA class III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, QRS duration &lt;120 ms, and MD as defined by the standard deviation of time to peak systolic velocity of 12 segments (Ts-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients received a CRT defibrillator, exercise testing, and echo exams, and 47 of these patients underwent invasive hemodynamic testing at implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average maximal improvement in LV dP/dt(max) was minor (2 ± 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NYHA and quality of life scores were substantially improved at 6 and 12 months (P &lt; 0.001), while exercise capacity and LV volumes were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The echo indices of MD were difficult to collect, discordant, and failed to predict clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ESTEEM-CRT patients with a narrow QRS and MD as defined in this study did not improve as measured by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise performance, or reverse remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These multi-center results support the notion that dyssynchrony indices are ineffective or at least require greater refinement for the selection of narrow QRS patients for CRT </plain></SENT>
