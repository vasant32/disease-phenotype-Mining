<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic complications resulting from radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) have an overall incidence of 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple intracardiac catheters are often necessary for electrophysiological study and RFCA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the placement of multiple venous sheaths in one femoral vein is always required for multiple intracardiac catheter insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety of the placement of multiple separate venous sheaths has been studied previously in a non-randomized study, but the placement of multiple sheaths via one venous line has not been fully studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted with a total of 200 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied the safety of placing multiple sheaths via one venous line, and the effect of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and on in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DVT was not seen in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant decrease in the rate of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients who received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure (28% vs 11%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The type of cannulation changed the in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate independently of the heparinization protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was higher when placing sheaths via one venous line regardless of the heparinization protocol used (16% vs 6%, p = 0.1 for the group on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, and 38% vs 18%, p = 0.04 for the other group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group cannulated with only one venous line (100 patients), heparinization significantly decreased the rate of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (16% vs 38%, p = 0.023), but there was an insignificant decrease in the separate cannulation group (6% vs 18%, p = 0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advanced age had no effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, there was a significantly greater rate of in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (not DVT) among women than among men (26% vs 11%, p = 0.01), regardless of the heparinization protocolor the type of cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the local venous complications and DVT after electrophysiological procedures, heparinization is not necessary for right-sided electrophysiological procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a minor complication that can be reduced by heparinization in patients undergoing one-line cannulation and in women during longer procedures </plain></SENT>
