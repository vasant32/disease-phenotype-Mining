<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 198 patients (age, 56 Â± 10 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to RFA (99 patients) or to AADs (99 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated efficacy of RFA or AADs in a comparable 48-month follow-up period according to intention-to-treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac rhythm was assessed with daily transtelephonic transmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 years, among the 99 patients first assigned to RFA, the procedure was repeated because of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in 27 patients (27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 99 patients randomly assigned to AADs, 87 (87.9%) crossed over to undergo RFA and 4 years after random assignment only 12 (12.1%) were in sinus rhythm with AAD alone without ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the high level of crossovers, at 4 years the intention-to-treat analysis showed that 72.7% of patients in the ablation arm and 56.5% of those initially randomly assigned to AADs were free of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 19.2% of AAD patients progressed to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> before switching to RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RFA significantly improved quality of life (P&lt;0.001), whereas before crossing over to RFA, patients receiving AADs showed poorer quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for new left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, there were no serious complications caused by RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With follow-up extended to 4 years after randomly assigned, ablation remains superior to antiarrhythmic drug in these patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
