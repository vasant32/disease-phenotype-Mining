<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Marek's disease</z:e> (MD) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> in chickens caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024793" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Marek's disease</z:e> virus (MDV) and characterized by T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and infiltration of lymphoid cells into various organs such as liver, spleen, peripheral nerves and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance to MD and disease risk have long been thought to be influenced both by genetic and environmental factors, the combination of which contributes to the observed outcome in an individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that after MDV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, genes related to MD-resistance or -susceptibility may exhibit different trends in transcriptional activity in chicken lines having a varying degree of resistance to MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In order to study the mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to MD, we performed genome-wide temporal expression analysis in spleen tissues from MD-resistant line 63, susceptible line 72 and recombinant congenic strain M (RCS-M) that has a phenotype intermediate between lines 63 and 72 after MDV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three time points of the MDV life cycle in chicken were selected for study: 5 days post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (dpi), 10dpi and 21dpi, representing the early cytolytic, latent and late cytolytic stages, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed similar gene expression profiles at the three time points in line 63 and RCS-M chickens that are both different from line 72 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>) showed that MDV can broadly influence the chickens irrespective of whether they are resistant or susceptible to MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, some pathways like <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were found to be affected only in line 72; while some networks related to cell-mediated immune response and antigen presentation were enriched only in line 63 and RCS-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 78 and 30 candidate genes associated with MD resistance, at 10 and 21dpi respectively, by considering genes having the same trend of expression change after MDV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in lines 63 and RCS-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, by considering genes with the same trend of expression change after MDV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in lines 72 and RCS-M, we identified 78 and 43 genes at 10 and 21dpi, respectively, which may be associated with MD-susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By testing temporal transcriptome changes using three representative chicken lines with different resistance to MD, we identified 108 candidate genes for MD-resistance and 121 candidate genes for MD-susceptibility over the three time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genes included in our resistance or susceptibility genes lists that are also involved in more than 5 biofunctions, such as CD8Î±, IL8, USP18, and CTLA4, are considered to be important genes involved in MD-resistance or -susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We were also able to identify several biofunctions related with immune response that we believe play an important role in MD-resistance </plain></SENT>
