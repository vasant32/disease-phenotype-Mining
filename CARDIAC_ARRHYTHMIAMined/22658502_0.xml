<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated long-term monitoring (LTM; 7 days or 1 year) in 203 patients off antiarrhythmic drugs who were clinically free of AF &gt;1 year after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 7-day monitor was done in 186 and 17 had pacemakers in whom the most recent year was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence was &gt;30 seconds of AF, flutter, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LTM was done 3.1 ± 1.3 years (range 1.1 to 7.3) after the last ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AF recurred in only 8 of 186 (4.3%) on 7-day monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One had persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the other 7, AF burden was 0.0075% to 3.34% with 3 of 7 having an AF burden ≤0.037% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AF recurred in 4 of 17 patients (23.5%) with pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients with pacemakers and AF had a 1-year AF burden of 0.0037% to 0.16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the longer duration of monitoring, pacemakers detected more AF than 7-day monitors (p &lt;0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF duration before ablation was the only predictor of AF recurrence on LTM (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with symptomatic AF who appeared free of AF on clinical grounds an average of 3 years after ablation, AF burden on LTM was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, monitoring by implanted devices detects more AF than 7-day monitors, most patients exceeding the failure definition of &gt;30 seconds have a small AF burden, and when using LTM for follow-up the definition of "ablation failure" may be better described by an AF burden &gt;0.5% rather than a single 30-second <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
