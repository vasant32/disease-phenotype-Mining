<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> are clinically challenging <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that can occur in the presence of atrial scar--often due to either cardiac surgery or prior ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated a catheter ablation approach employing rapid multielectrode activation mapping with targeted entrainment manoeuvrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role that AT isthmus location plays in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term success of ablation remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective multicenter analysis of 91 consecutive AT patients undergoing ablation using a systematic four-step approach: (i) high-density activation mapping; (ii) analysis of atrial activation to identify wavefronts of electrical propagation; (iii) targeted entrainment of putative channels; and (iv) irrigated radiofrequency ablation of constrained regions of the circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes, procedural details, and clinical profiles were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 171 ATs (1.9 Â± 1.0 per patient, 26% septal ATs) were targeted for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rates were 97 and 77% for patients with either non-septal ATs or septal ATs, respectively (P = 0.0023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the long-term success rates were 82 and 67% for patients with either no septal ATs or at least one septal AT, respectively (P = 0.1057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term success rates were 75, 88, and 57% for patients with ATs associated with prior catheter ablation, cardiac surgery or MAZE, and idiopathic atrial scar, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation of AT can be successfully performed employing a strategy of combined high-density activation and entrainment mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Septal ATs are associated with higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term recurrences </plain></SENT>
