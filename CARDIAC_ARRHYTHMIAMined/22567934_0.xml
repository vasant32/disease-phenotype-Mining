<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the work was to estimate dispersion of QT interval during Holler monitoring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (AH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study involved 28 patients with COPD (including 17 with COPD + AH), 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>bronchial asthma</z:hpo> (BA) (including16 with BA + AH), and 17 practically healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that a combination of COPD and AH is associated with high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (by Lown-Wolf classification) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dispersion of QT interval indicates that the risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in patients with COPD and AH is unrelated to ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp> and ventricular myocardium mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BA and AH exhibited electrical instability regardless of myocardial mass only in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with BA and AH the QTcd interval increased in the second half of day, in COPD patients from morning till evening, and in patients with COPD + AH during 24 hours </plain></SENT>
