<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limitations to existing clinical therapeutic management strategies prompted us to develop a novel human in vitro drug-evaluation system for LQTS type 2 (LQT2) that will complement the existing in vitro and in vivo models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Skin fibroblasts from a patient with a KCNH2 G1681A mutation (encodes I(Kr) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> channel) were reprogrammed to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which were subsequently differentiated to functional cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls (including the patient's mother), multi-electrode array and patch-clamp electrophysiology of LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes showed prolonged field/action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes were exposed to E4031 (an I(Kr) blocker), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> developed and these presented as early after depolarizations (EADs) in the action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to control cardiomyocytes, LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes also developed EADs when challenged with the clinically used stressor, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was reversed by Î²-blockers, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7444">nadolol</z:chebi>, the latter being used for the patient's therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cardiomyocytes with experimental <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel enhancers, nicorandil and PD118057, caused action potential shortening and in some cases could abolish EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (enhancers/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>) caused EADs, but this effect was reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7444">nadolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this paper demonstrate that patient LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes respond appropriately to clinically relevant pharmacology and will be a valuable human in vitro model for testing experimental drug combinations </plain></SENT>
