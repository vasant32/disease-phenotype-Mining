<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart rate reactivity, blood pressure reactivity, and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> reactivity while recounting a relational stressor (e.g., being left out) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants provided self-reports of relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> prior to age 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that cardiovascular reactivity was only associated with relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> among women with a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, whereas blunted reactivity was associated with proactive relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, exaggerated reactivity was associated with reactive relational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the importance of considering contextual moderators of the association between cardiovascular reactivity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>; moreover, results highlight distinct cardiovascular correlates of different functions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the findings underscore the need for additional research examining the physiological correlates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> among women </plain></SENT>
