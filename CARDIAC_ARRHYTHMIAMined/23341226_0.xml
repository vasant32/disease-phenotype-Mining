<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A novel duty-cycled bipolar/unipolar ablation catheter pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) has been developed to achieve pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation with PVAC was recently found to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> narrowing at 3 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The long-term effects of this catheter on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> dimensions are however unknown and were evaluated with this study.METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 62, 71% male, age 60 ± 7 years) with drug-refractory AF scheduled for a first ablation procedure were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) scan was performed before and 1 year after the initial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein dimensions and left atrial (LA) volume were measured on MSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To correct for reverse remodelling of the LA, the ostial area/LA volume ratio before and after PVAC was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As reverse remodelling may depend on procedural outcome, patients were divided in two groups depending on sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance or AF recurrence 1 year after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were comparable between the SR group (n = 41) and the AF recurrence group (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At one year follow-up, ostial area of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (n = 219) was significantly reduced from 236 ± 7.0 to 173 ± 7.4 mm(2) (27% narrowing, P &lt; 0.01), independent of ablation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein narrowing was mild in 37% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (25-50%), 9% was moderate (50-70%), and 3% severe (&gt;70%).Left atrial volumes were found to be significantly reduced after ablation (14 and 5% for the SR group and AF recurrence group, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for LA volume reduction, narrowing of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostial area remained significant in these patients (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSION: Ablation with PVAC results in a significant decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> dimensions after long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In line with previous literature, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> narrowing was mild and patients did not develop any clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
