<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing is a robust predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in at-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies have suggested that MTWA testing is not as good a predictor of "appropriate" implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy as it is a predictor of SCD in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of MTWA testing for SCD risk stratification in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient-level data were obtained from 5 prospective studies of MTWA testing in patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> or SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were implanted in only a minority of patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conducted a pooled analysis and examined the 2-year risk for SCD based on the MTWA test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pooled cohort included 2883 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MTWA testing was positive in 856 (30%), negative in 1627 (56%), and indeterminate in 400 (14%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤35%, annual SCD event rates were 4.0%, 0.9%, and 4.6% among groups with MTWA positive, negative, and indeterminate test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SCD rate was significantly lower among patients with a negative MTWA test result than in patients with either positive or indeterminate MTWA test results (P &lt;.001 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with an LVEF of &gt;35%, annual SCD event rates were 3.0%, 0.3%, and 0.3% among the groups with MTWA positive, negative, and indeterminate test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SCD rate associated with a positive MTWA test result was significantly higher than that associated with either negative (P &lt;.001) or indeterminate MTWA test results (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, MTWA testing is a powerful predictor of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among patients with an LVEF of ≤35%, a negative MTWA test result is associated with a low risk for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conversely, among patients with an LVEF of &gt;35%, a positive MTWA test result identifies patients at significantly heightened SCD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings may have important implications for refining primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment algorithms </plain></SENT>
