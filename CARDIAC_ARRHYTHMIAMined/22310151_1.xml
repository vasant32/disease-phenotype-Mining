<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 212 endocardial leads removed from 141 consecutive patients-due to IE (32), pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (37), and non-infective indications (72)-were analysed with a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> in the intracardiac part (IP) of the atrial (P &lt; 0.01) and ventricular (P &lt; 0.00002) leads, regardless of its advancement, was strongly associated with IE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> in the IP of the ventricular (P &lt; 0.00002) and atrial (P &lt; 0.005) leads and two or more implanted endocardial leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In atrial leads, there was an association between the presence of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> and passive fixation (P &lt; 0.05), dwell time (P &lt; 0.05), and number of procedures until removal (P &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third level of degradation was the most frequently observed in the IP of the leads </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an association between the presence of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> in the IP of the leads and the number of leads, and in the case of atrial leads between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> and fixation type, dwell time, and number of procedures until explantation </plain></SENT>
