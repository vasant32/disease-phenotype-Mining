<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Nkx2.5 is one of the most widely studied cardiac-specific transcription factors, conserved from flies to man, with multiple essential roles in both the developing and adult heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific dominant mutations in NKX2.5 have been identified in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> patients presenting with conduction system anomalies and recent genome-wide association studies implicate the NKX2.5 locus, as causative for lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>") that occur at a frequency in the population of 1 in 1000 per annum worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency for Nkx2.5 in the mouse phenocopies human conduction disease pathology yet the phenotypes, described in both mouse and man, are highly pleiotropic, implicit of unknown modifiers and/or factors acting in epistasis with Nkx2.5/NKX2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify bone fide upstream genetic modifier(s) of Nkx2.5/NKX2.5 function and to determine epistatic effects relevant to the manifestation of NKX2.5-dependent adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A study of cardiac function in prospero-related homeobox protein 1 (Prox1) heterozygous mice, using pressure-volume loop and micromannometry, revealed rescue of hemodynamic parameters in Nkx2.5(Cre/+); Prox1(loxP/+) animals versus Nkx2.5(Cre/+) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anatomic studies, on a Cx40(EGFP) background, revealed Cre-mediated knock-down of Prox1 restored the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje network both of which were severely hypoplastic in Nkx2.5(Cre/+) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Steady state surface electrocardiography recordings and high-speed multiphoton imaging, to assess Ca(2+) handling, revealed atrioventricular conduction and excitation-contraction were also normalized by Prox1 haploinsufficiency, as was expression of conduction genes thought to act downstream of Nkx2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation on adult hearts, in combination with both gain and loss-of-function reporter assays in vitro, revealed that Prox1 recruits the corepressor HDAC3 to directly repress Nkx2.5 via a proximal upstream enhancer as a mechanism for regulating Nkx2.5 function in adult cardiac conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Here we identify Prox1 as a direct upstream modifier of Nkx2.5 in the maintenance of the adult conduction system and rescue of Nkx2.5 conduction disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is the first example of rescue of Nkx2.5 function and establishes a model for ensuring electrophysiological function within the adult heart alongside insight into a novel Prox1-HDAC3-Nkx2.5 signaling pathway for therapeutic targeting in conduction disease </plain></SENT>
