<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> can contribute to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate whether catheter ablation of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> can improve LV dysfunction in patients with and without troublesome <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 80 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>, 24 (aged 60 ± 15 years) were found to have a reduced LV ejection fraction at baseline (&lt;48%) and included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No important procedure-related complications occurred in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 8 months, the <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> burden after ablation had decreased from 15 ± 6% to 1 ± 1% (p &lt;0.001), and the left ventricular ejection fraction had increased from 32 ± 15% to 43 ± 14% (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (42%) had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> before ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other 14 patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> were improved or entirely resolved after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the extent of LV ejection fraction improvement after ablation between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> (+11 ± 12% vs +11 ± 11%, p = 0.941) or between patients with different locations of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> might not necessarily be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> in many patients with LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation of frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> in these "asymptomatic" patients is associated with an improvement in LV function similar to that observed in "symptomatic" patients </plain></SENT>
