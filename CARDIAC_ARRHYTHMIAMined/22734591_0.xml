<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no studies of ablation in patients with severe pulmonary arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with severe <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> (systolic pulmonary artery pressure &gt;60 mmHg) and AFL referred for ablation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 14 AFL ablation procedures were undertaken in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 75% of patients were female; mean age 49 ± 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPAP prior to ablation was 99 ± 35 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline 6-minute walk distance was 295 ± 118 m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECG demonstrated a typical AFL pattern in only 42% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline AFL cycle length was longer in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> patients compared to controls (295 ± 53 ms vs 252 ± 35 ms, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cavotricuspid isthmus dependence was verified in 86% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was obtained in 86% of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SPAP decreased from 114 ± 44 mmHg to 82 ± 38 mmHg after ablation (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BNP levels were lower postablation (787 ± 832 pg/mL vs 522 ± 745 pg/mL, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complications were seen in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A total of 80% (8/10) of patients were free of AFL at 3 months; 75% (6/8) at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablation of AFL in severe <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> patients is feasible, with good short- and intermediate-term success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The ECG pattern is not a reliable marker of isthmus dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The SPAP and BNP levels may decrease postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>AFL may be a marker of poor outcomes in patients with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> with a 1-year mortality rate of 42% in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This rate is higher than expected in the general <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> population </plain></SENT>
