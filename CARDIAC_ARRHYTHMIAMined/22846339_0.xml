<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The calcium-dependent signaling molecules calcineurin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) both have been linked to decompensated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CaMKII is also believed to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> modulation of ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of calcineurin and CaMKII in a dog model of compensated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and a long QT phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> was created in dogs to induce ventricular remodeling, including enhanced susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> for 3 weeks, which reduced calcineurin activity, as determined by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of regulator of calcineurin 1 exon 4, but which was unable to prevent structural, contractile, or electrical remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were taken before and at 2 or 9 weeks after <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots were performed against phosphorylated and total CaMKII, phospholamban, Akt, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> showed an increase in Akt, CaMKII and phospholamban phosphorylation levels, but HDAC4 phosphorylation remained unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> in vivo and early afterdepolarizations in cardiomyocytes, and increased [Ca(2+)](i) and CaMKII autophosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both W-7 and KN-93 treatment counteracted this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The calcineurin pathway seems not to be involved in long-term cardiac remodeling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although CaMKII is chronically activated, this does not translate to HDAC4 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CaMKII overactivation is able to initiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> based on triggered activity </plain></SENT>
