<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The importance of heart rate in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with reduced LVEF has recently attracted attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, the findings of the Systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine Trial (SHIFT) have put special emphasis on heart rate reduction with ivabradine for improvement in clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of course, there is a much older drug that reduces heart rate, i.e. digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this short commentary, we retrospectively analyse the Digitalis Investigation Group (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIG</z:e>) Trial looking at the primary composite endpoint used in SHIFT (i.e. cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospital admission for worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) and compare the effect of digoxin on this endpoint with that of ivabradine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A remarkably similar risk reduction in the composite outcome and in its components appears evident among patients receiving the active treatment in both studies (although ivabradine was added to a beta-blocker, whereas digoxin was not) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This raises the question of whether the Cardiological community dismissed digoxin too readily and if we should reappraise its potential role in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
