<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Clinical Evaluation on Advanced Resynchronization (CLEAR) study aimed to assess the effects of CRT with automatically optimized atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays, based on a Peak Endocardial Acceleration (PEA) signal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicentre, single-blind study randomized patients in a 1 : 1 ratio to CRT optimized either automatically by the PEA-based system, or according to centres' usual practices, mostly by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;35%, QRS duration &gt;150 or &gt;120 ms with mechanical dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved their condition at 1 year, based on a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, HF hospitalizations, NYHA class, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 268 patients in sinus rhythm (63% men; mean age: 73.1 ± 9.9 years; mean NYHA: 3.0 ± 0.3; mean LVEF: 27.1 ± 8.1%; and mean QRS duration: 160.1 ± 22.0 ms) were included and 238 patients were randomized, 123 to PEA and 115 to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, 76% of patients assigned to PEA were classified as improved, vs. 62% in the control group (P= 0.0285) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with improved NYHA class was significantly (P= 0.0020) higher in the PEA group than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fatal and non-fatal adverse events were evenly distributed between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PEA-based optimization of CRT in HF patients significantly increased the proportion of patients who improved with therapy, mainly through improved NYHA class, after 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
