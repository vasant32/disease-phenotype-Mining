<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to International Conference on Harmonization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) E14, a thorough QT/QTc study is required for most new compounds to assess the potential to cause QT prolongation, because a delay in cardiac repolarization may create an electrophysiological environment that favors the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, most notably <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsade de Pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore a thorough QTc study was conducted to evaluate the effect of sugammadex on the individually corrected QTc interval (QTcI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following two baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) days (Day -2 and Day -1), in this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, healthy volunteers received a sequence of four treatments comprising single intravenous doses of placebo, moxifloxacin 400 mg (positive control, open label), sugammadex 4 mg/kg and sugammadex 32 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECGs were recorded in triplicate at 12 time points up to ~ 24 h after study drug administration, and the QT intervals were evaluated manually under blinded conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pre-specified primary endpoint was the largest time-matched mean QTcI difference compared with placebo across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 62 subjects received treatment, of which 58 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After intravenous moxifloxacin, QTcI prolongations compared with placebo exceeded the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> E14 safety margin of 10 msec and the one-sided 95% lower confidence limit exceeded 5 msec, confirming assay sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For both sugammadex doses, the one-sided 95% upper confidence limits for the largest time-matched mean QTcI differences compared with placebo were ≤ 5.3 msec at each timepoint and thus considerably below the 10 msec safety margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the two full-day baseline ECGs indicated systematically prolonged QTc values when comparing the first baseline with the second baseline day, reaching a maximum mean difference of 3.8 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single therapeutic (4 mg/kg) and supra-therapeutic (32 mg/kg) intravenous doses of sugammadex are not associated with clinically important QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
