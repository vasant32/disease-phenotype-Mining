<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to verify the relationship between inflammatory markers, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (12 women and 33 men, mean age 62.3 ± 9.4 years) underwent surgical myocardial revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was used in 30 patients, without ECC was 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 3 postoperative days was determining the incidence and duration of the AF, laboratory markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (CRP, leukocytes, TNFα), malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic data and associated disease were in this patients similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AF we documented in 30 patients (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with postoperative AF were significantly higher levels of inflammatory markers (leukocytes 13.6 ± 3.6 vs 11.3 ± 3.6; 14.7 ± 3.9 vs 12.5 ± 2.9; 13.7 ± 4.1 vs 11.4 ± 13.7; p 0.05; CRP 138.1 ± 41.1 vs 69.9 ± 25.8; p 0.001; TNFα 11.3 ± 14.3 vs 8.7 ± 3.6; 12.1 ± 14.5 vs 8.7 ± 3.1; p 0.05) compared with patients who were free from AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Values of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were higher levels of inflammatory markers compared with patients with sinus rhythm but no significant differences in the levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
