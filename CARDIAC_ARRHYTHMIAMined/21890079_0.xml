<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from adults undergoing cardiac surgery suggest an association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> and an increased risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> is an independent risk factor for tachyarrhythmias after congenital heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects undergoing congenital heart surgery at our institution were consecutively enrolled for 38 months, through September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were prospectively collected, including a review of full-disclosure telemetry and the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 38 months, 603 enrolled subjects underwent 724 operative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 5.5 months (range 0.0 to 426), the median weight was 6.0 kg (range 0.7 to 108), and the cohort was 45% female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence was 50%, most commonly monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 85, 12%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 69, 10%), accelerated junctional rhythm (n = 58, 8%), and atrial tachyarrhythmias (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and ectopic or chaotic atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, n = 58, 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that independent of age &lt;1 month, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, Risk Adjusted classification for Congenital Heart Surgery, version 1, score &gt;3, and the use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> use on admission to the cardiac intensive care unit remained independently associated with an increase in the odds of postoperative tachyarrhythmia resulting in an intervention (odds ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.0, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> use is an independent risk factor for clinically significant tachyarrhythmias in the early postoperative period after congenital heart surgery </plain></SENT>
