<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied low-dose human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (hANP) infusion therapy during cardiac surgery and reported the cardiac and renal protective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of a bolus injection of hANP (the "hANP shot") simultaneously with induction of cardioplegia has been proven in animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study the clinical effects of this "hANP shot" were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects were 67 patients undergoing Coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of inducing cardioplegia, 1 group received a simultaneous bolus injection of 100 Î¼g of hANP (hANP group) and the other group received an injection of physiological saline (placebo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were (1) operative mortality and complications, and (2) the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase isoenzyme MB (CPK-MB), troponin-I, and human heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints were (1) the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and levels of (2) atrial and B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and cyclic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cGMP), and (3) renin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CPK-MB, troponin-I, and H-FABP levels were significantly lower in the hANP group than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was significantly less frequent in the hANP group than in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to achieve cardioprotective effects based on the safety of the "hANP shot", as well as from biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and results related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The "hANP shot" should also be evaluated as a safer and new cardioprotective method for cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
