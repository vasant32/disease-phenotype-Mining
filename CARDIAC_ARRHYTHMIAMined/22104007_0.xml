<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the history of arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> since its discovery in the 1980s at autopsy of young subjects, who died suddenly during effort as a first manifestation of the disease and in whom the right ventricle was found as the source of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the contributions have come from the Padua as well as from the Paris and London schools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigations were then developed to arrive at the diagnosis, and these include electrocardiography, angiography, echocardiography, electroanatomic mapping, endomyocardial biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disqualification from sport activity and implantable cardioverter defibrillator proved to be life-saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic investigations have confirmed that arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a hereditary Mendelian disease, either dominant or recessive, with mutations of genes encoding intercellular proteins (desmosome disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease was recently reproduced in transgenic mice, with electrocardiographic and morphologic features overlapping the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurs with time as a genetically determined injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The challenge now is to find ways to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
