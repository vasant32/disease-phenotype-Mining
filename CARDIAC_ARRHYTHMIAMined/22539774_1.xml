<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a mechanism for drug-induced QT prolongation that involves changes in multiple ion currents caused by a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of canine cardiac myocytes with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or PI3Ks caused an increase in action potential duration that was reversed by intracellular infusion of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitors decreased the delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents I(Kr) and I(Ks), the L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> (Ca(2+)) current I(Ca,L), and the peak <z:chebi fb="33" ids="29101">sodium ion</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>) current I(Na) and increased the persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current I(NaP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer modeling of the canine ventricular action potential showed that the drug-induced change in any one current accounted for less than 50% of the increase in action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse hearts lacking the PI3K p110Î± catalytic subunit exhibited a prolonged action potential and QT interval that were at least partly a result of an increase in I(NaP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that down-regulation of PI3K signaling directly or indirectly via tyrosine kinase inhibition prolongs the QT interval by affecting multiple ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This mechanism may explain why some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> in clinical use are associated with increased risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
