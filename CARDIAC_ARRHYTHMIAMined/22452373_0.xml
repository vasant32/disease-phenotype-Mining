<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of development of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients with atrioventricular (AV) block and dual chamber (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>) pacemakers has not been separately investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether persistent AF influences clinical outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred-eight consecutive patients with second- or third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and implanted a <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker were followed for 36 ± 20 months and retrospectively divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients who developed persistent AF formed persistent AF group, and 278 patients who remained free of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and outcome data of the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred more often among the patients in the persistent AF group (6.8% per year) than among those in the control group (2.9% per year; P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was primarily because of higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the persistent AF group (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and paroxysmal AF episode ≥5 minutes, occurred also more often among the patients in the persistent AF group (P = 0.008 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively), although the risk of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was similar in both groups (P = 0.628) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with second- or third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker, the development of persistent AF is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
