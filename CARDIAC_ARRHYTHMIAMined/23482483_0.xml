<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the current study was to determine the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> 99m Tc-MIBI, for the prediction of perioperative cardiac events.Materials and methods:This study included 253 patients who were candidates for non-cardiac elective surgery and underwent scanning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> 99m Tc-MIBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal MPI, patients were divided into two groups and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preoperative cardiac events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking and age ≥70 years, were compared between patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal MPI and, also, in patients with or without cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 197 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 56 patients with abnormal MPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 14 patients had perioperative cardiac events, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; of the 14 patients with perioperative cardiac events, 12 had abnormal and two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were statistically meaningful differences between the two groups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we determined that MPI had a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 81.6%, an accuracy of 81.8%, a positive predictive value of 21.4 % and a negative predictive value of 98.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of perioperative cardiac events is higher in patients with abnormal MPI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">Dipyridamole</z:chebi> 99m Tc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging can accurately detect the preoperative cardiac risk of patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, the occurrence of perioperative cardiac events in patients with abnormal MPI should be considered, especially in the older age population (age ≥70) </plain></SENT>
