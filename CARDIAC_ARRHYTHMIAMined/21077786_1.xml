<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The main indication for ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> is symptomatic relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generic measures of quality of life are not suitable for direct evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms, and a specific tool is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire U22 quantifies symptoms associated with arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It uses discrete 0-10 scales for quantification of influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on well-being, intensity of discomfort, type of dominant symptom, and a time aspect that summarizes duration and frequency of spells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated U22 in a well defined group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004763'>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, undergoing an intervention with a distinct end-point and a high success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Symptoms in patients with accessory pathway and atrioventricular nodal re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> scheduled for ablation were measured with U22 and SF-36 on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The evaluation was repeated after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether 58 patients successfully ablated in 2006-2008 completed the four forms (U22 and SF-36 at base-line and follow-up, 210 ± 35 days after ablation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The score for well-being (0-10; 10 being best) increased from 5.9 ± 2.6 to 7.9 ± 1.9 (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as cause for impairment in well-being (0-10; 10 being highest) decreased from 7.5 ± 2.8 to 2.0 ± 3.1 (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time aspect score (0-10) decreased from 4.7 ± 1.5 to 1.4 ± 1.8 (P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The two SF-36 summary measures PCS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> increased from 46.9 ± 9.4 to 48.4 ± 10.7 and from 44.9 ± 12.5 to 49.1 ± 9.9 (P = 0.04 and 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After successful ablation of accessory pathway and atrioventricular nodal re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, the U22 protocol detected a relevant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Modest improvement in general well-being was detected by the SF-36 protocol </plain></SENT>
