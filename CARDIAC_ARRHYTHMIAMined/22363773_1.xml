<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Changes in FKBP12.6 binding to cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors (RyR2) are implicated in mediating disturbances in Ca(2+)-homeostasis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> but there is controversy over the functional effects of FKBP12.6 on RyR2 channel gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have therefore investigated the effects of FKBP12.6 and another structurally similar molecule, FKBP12, which is far more abundant in heart, on the gating of single sheep RyR2 channels incorporated into planar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> bilayers and on spontaneous waves of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release in rat isolated permeabilised cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that FKBP12 is a high affinity activator of RyR2, sensitising the channel to cytosolic Ca(2+), whereas FKBP12.6 has very low efficacy, but can antagonise the effects of FKBP12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modelling of the data shows the importance of the relative concentrations of FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 in determining RyR2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the single-channel results, physiological concentrations of FKBP12 (3 ÂµM) increased Ca(2+)-wave frequency and decreased the SR Ca(2+)-content in cardiac cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FKBP12.6, itself, had no effect on wave frequency but antagonised the effects of FKBP12.We provide a biophysical analysis of the mechanisms by which FK-binding proteins can regulate RyR2 single-channel gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that FKBP12, in addition to FKBP12.6, may be important in regulating RyR2 function in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, it is possible that an alteration in the dual regulation of RyR2 by FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This could contribute towards a higher RyR2 open probability, 'leaky' RyR2 channels and Ca(2+)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
