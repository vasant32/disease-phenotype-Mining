<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Together with KCNE1, it forms the slowly activating delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current IKs  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, where the subunits assemble and which of the subunits determines localization of the IKs -complex has not been unequivocally resolved yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed trafficking-deficient KV 7.1 and KCNE1 mutants to investigate IKs trafficking using the polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that the assembly happens early in the secretory pathway but provide three lines of evidence that it takes place in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that KV 7.1 targets the IKs -complex to the basolateral membrane, but that KCNE1 can redirect the complex to the apical membrane upon mutation of critical KV 7.1 basolateral targeting signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data provide a possible explanation to the fact that KV 7.1 can be localized apically or basolaterally in different epithelial tissues and offer a solution to divergent literature results regarding the effect of KCNE subunits on the subcellular localization of KV 7.1/KCNE complexes </plain></SENT>
