<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we analyze and criticize the results of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> classification methods presented in the literature in terms of how the samples are chosen for training/testing the classifier and the impact this choice has on their performance (i.e., accuracy/sensitivity/specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From our implementation, we also report new accuracies for these methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art method, in terms of results </plain></SENT>
