<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> requiring pacemaker placement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increase exponentially after the age of 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is important to distinguish between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, physiological consequences of aging on cardiac electrophysiology and the abnormal, pathological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age-related cardiac changes include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, cardiac valvular degenerative changes and annular calcification, fibrous infiltration of the conduction system, and loss of natural pacemaker cells and these changes could have a profound effect on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age-related cardiac electrophysiological changes include up- and down-regulation of specificÂ ion channel expression and intracellular Ca(2+) overload which promote the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As ion channels are the substrates of antiarrhythmic drugs, it follows that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs will also change with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aging alters the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of antiarrhythmic drugs, so liver and kidney function must be monitored to avoid potential adverse drug effects, and antiarrhythmic dosing may need to be adjusted for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients are also more susceptible to the side effects of many antiarrhythmics, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the choice of antiarrhythmic drugs in the elderly patient is frequently complicated by the presence of co-morbid conditions and by polypharmacy, and the astute physician must pay careful attention to potential drug-drug interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is important to remember that the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in elderly patients must be individualized and tailored to each patient's <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, disease processes, and medication regimen </plain></SENT>
