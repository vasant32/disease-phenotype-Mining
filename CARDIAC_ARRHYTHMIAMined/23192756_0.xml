<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Observational studies indicate that outpatient cardiac monitoring detects previously undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in 5% to 20% of patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unknown whether the yield of monitoring exceeds that of routine clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a pilot trial, we randomly assigned 40 patients with cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or high-risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> to wear a Cardionet mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry monitor for 21 days or to receive routine follow-up alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After thorough investigation, we excluded patients with documented AF or other apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We contacted patients and their physicians at 3 months and at 1 year to ascertain any diagnoses of AF or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of our cohort broadly matched those of previous observational studies of monitoring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the monitoring group, patients wore monitors for 64% of the assigned days, and 25% of patients were not compliant at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient in either study arm received a diagnosis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac monitoring revealed AF in zero patients (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-17%), brief episodes of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in 2 patients (10%; 95% confidence interval, 1%-32%), and nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 2 patients (10%; 95% confidence interval, 1%-32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the first reported randomized trial of cardiac monitoring after cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the rate of AF detection was lower than expected, incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were frequent, and compliance with monitoring was suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the challenges of prospectively identifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients at risk for harboring paroxysmal AF and ensuring adequate compliance with cardiac monitoring </plain></SENT>
