<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: Elucidation of the genetic substrates underlying heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes has unearthed new arrhythmogenic mechanisms and given rise to a number of clinically meaningful genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As such, genetic testing for these disorders now carries important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent large-scale systematic studies designed to explore the background genetic 'noise' rate associated with these genetic tests have provided important insights and enhanced how positive genetic testing results are interpreted for these potentially lethal, yet highly treatable, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Clinically available genetic tests for heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes allow the identification of potentially at-risk family members and contribute to the risk-stratification and selection of therapeutic interventions in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systematic evaluation of the 'signal-to-noise' ratio associated with these genetic tests has proven critical and essential to assessing the probability that a given variant represents a rare pathogenic mutation or an equally rare, yet innocuous, genetic bystander </plain></SENT>
