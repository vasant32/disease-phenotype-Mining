<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which represent a particularly lethal manifestation of IR injury, can result when ischemic tissue exhibits decreased excitability and/or changes of action potential duration (APD), conditions that precipitate unidirectional conduction block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of the cellular components that are involved with IR injury are modulated by pH and/or phosphometabolites such as ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which can be manipulated in vivo and potentially in the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a mathematical model of the cardiomyocyte that we previously developed to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, we performed a series of simulations with the aim of determining whether pH- or phosphometabolite-related processes play a more significant role in generating changes in excitability and action potential <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> that are associated with the development of reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our simulations, persistent shortening of APD, action potential amplitude (<z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi>), and depolarization of the resting membrane potential were more severe when ATP and PCr availability were suppressed during reperfusion than when extracellular pH recovery was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced phosphometabolite availability and pH recovery affected multiple ion channels and exchangers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of these effects were the result of direct modulation by phosphometabolites and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo>, while others resulted from elevated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium loads during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, increasing ATP and PCr availability during reperfusion was more beneficial in terms of increasing APD and <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53713">APA</z:chebi> than was increasing the amount of pH recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that therapies directed at increasing ATP and/or PCr availability during reperfusion may be more beneficial than perturbing pH recovery with regard to mitigating action potential changes that increase the likelihood of reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
