<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most common dysrhythmia observed in the emergency department (ED), yet there is little research describing long-term outcomes after ED management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to describe ED treatment approach, conversion success rates, ED adverse events, and 30-day and 1-year outcomes for a cohort of ED patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> underlying medical cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a database from 2 urban EDs to identify consecutive patients with an ED discharge diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> from April 1, 2006, to March 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities, rhythms, management, and immediate outcomes were obtained by manual chart review, and patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> underlying medical condition were excluded by predefined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into 5 groups according to ED management: electrocardioversion, chemical cardioversion, spontaneous cardioversion, rate control only, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and ED revisits within 1 year, each patient's unique provincial health number was linked to the provincial vital statistics registry and the regional ED database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the number of patients having either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause at 30 days, stratified by treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 927 consecutive eligible patients, 121 (13.1%) converted to sinus rhythm before ED intervention, 357 (38.5%) received ED rhythm control, and 449 (48.4%) did not receive rhythm control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 142 of 927 patients (15.3%) were admitted to the hospital at the index ED visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 30 days, 2 patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 5 died (combined outcome rate 0.8%; 95% confidence interval 0.3% to 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 of these patients were admitted at the index ED visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of ED patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> underlying medical cause, the 30-day rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was less than 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nearly 85% of patients-regardless of treatment approach or conversion to sinus rhythm-were discharged at the index ED visit, and none of these patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or died at 30 days </plain></SENT>
