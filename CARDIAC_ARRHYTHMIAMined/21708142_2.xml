<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growing studies demonstrate that genetic defects play pivotal roles in a subgroup of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is a genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder and the molecular basis of AF in a majority of cases remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The whole coding region of the GATA4 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for cardiogenesis, was analyzed in 130 unrelated probands with AF in contrast to 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available family members of the probands harboring the identified mutations were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of the mutant GATA4 was characterized using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous GATA4 mutations, p.S70T and p.S160T, were identified in 2 unrelated families with AF inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait, respectively, which co-segregated with AF in each family with complete penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis showed that the mutations of GATA4 were associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of AF, suggesting the potential implications in the genetic diagnosis and gene-specific therapy of this common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
