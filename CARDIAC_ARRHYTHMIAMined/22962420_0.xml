<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy is widely used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that electric separation during left ventricular pacing varies within the right ventricle (RV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that placement of the RV lead guided by maximal electric separation (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) would improve response to cardiac resynchronization therapy compared with standard apical placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy-D were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead placement was performed at the coronary sinus branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RV outflow tract, septum, and apex were mapped during left ventricular pacing and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive either apical placement or RV lead placement at the site mapping <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction, 6-minute walk distance, and New York Heart Association functional class were recorded at baseline and 3 months by blinded observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Response was defined as at least one of the following: 5% absolute increase in ejection fraction, 50 m increase in 6-minute walk distance, or an increase by &gt;1 functional class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary end point was improvement in ejection fraction at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients were randomized (25 MES-guided and 25 apical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Electric separation was lower in the apex (143 ± 23 versus 168 ± 25 ms in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> group; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was most commonly septal and rarely apical (4/50 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Responders in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-guided versus apical group are as follows: Echo 21 versus 13 patients (P=0.032), 6-minute walk distance 19 versus 12 patients (P=0.079), and functional class 22 versus 15 patients (P=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No dislodgment or reposition for suboptimal defibrillation tests was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>-guided placement of the RV lead improves cardiac resynchronization therapy responders compared with standard apical placement </plain></SENT>
