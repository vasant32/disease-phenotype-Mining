<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to estimate whether prehospital <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> also increases the risk of ALI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: Adult patients admitted to 22 centers with at least 1 risk factor for developing ALI were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a secondary analysis of this cohort, the prehospital use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was documented on admission, and the patients followed for the primary outcome of ALI and secondary outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>, the need for invasive ventilation, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dose/duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy was not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Propensity matching was performed to account for imbalances in being assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted risk for ALI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> was then estimated from a conditional logistic regression model of this propensity-matched set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty of 5584 patients were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> at the time of hospitalization; of those, 6 developed ALI, with 5 progressing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 371 patients not on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> developed ALI, with 224 having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After propensity score matching, the prehospital use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was not statistically associated with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ALI (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-5.0; P = .25), invasive ventilation (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6; P = .059), or in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-2.9; P = .75); but its use appeared to significantly increase the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1-13.1; P = .036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> may independently increase the risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> in patients who have at least 1 predisposing condition for ALI </plain></SENT>
