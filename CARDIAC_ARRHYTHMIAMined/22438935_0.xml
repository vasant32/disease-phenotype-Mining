<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is known to be an important risk factor for increased cardiac mortality in other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interaction of cardio-respiratory function and respiratory <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> has never been investigated in the disease although it might be closely related to the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that increased breathing rates and reduced cardio-respiratory coupling in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> would be associated with low vagal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed variability of breathing rates and depth, HRV and cardio-respiratory coupling in patients, their first-degree relatives and controls at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control subjects were investigated a second time by means of a stress task to identify stress-related changes of cardio-respiratory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 subjects were investigated, consisting of 23 unmedicated patients, 20 healthy, first-degree relatives and 30 control subjects matched for age, gender, smoking and physical fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LifeShirtÂ®, a multi-function ambulatory device, was used for data recording (30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients breathe significantly faster (p&lt;.001) and shallower (p&lt;.001) than controls most pronouncedly during exhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients' breathing is characterized by a significantly increased amount of middle- (p&lt;.001), high- (p&lt;.001), and very high frequency fluctuations (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These measures correlated positively with positive symptoms as assessed by the PANSS scale (e.g., middle frequency: r = 521; p&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardio-respiratory coupling was reduced in patients only, while HRV was decreased in patients and healthy relatives in comparison to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Respiratory alterations might reflect arousal in acutely ill patients, which is supported by comparable physiological changes in healthy subjects during stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future research needs to further investigate these findings with respect to their physiological consequences for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results are invaluable for researchers studying changes of biological signals prone to the influence of breathing rate and rhythm (e.g., functional imaging) </plain></SENT>
