<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To test whether a functional growth law leads to asymmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and associated changes in global and regional cardiac function when integrated with a computational model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In recent studies, we proposed that cardiac myocytes grow longer when a threshold of maximum fibre strain is exceeded and grow thicker when the smallest maximum principal strain in the cellular cross-sectional plane exceeds a threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A non-linear cardiovascular model of the beating canine ventricles was combined with the cellular growth law </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After inducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>, the ventricles were allowed to adapt in shape over time in response to mechanical stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When subjected to electrical dyssynchrony, the combined model of ventricular electromechanics, haemodynamics, and growth led to asymmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> with a faster increase of wall mass in the left ventricular (LV) free wall (FW) than the septum, increased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and decreased LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic LV pressure decreased during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> and increased at later stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative changes of these parameters were similar to those obtained experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the dilation was due to radial and axial fibre growth, and hence altered shape of the LVFW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our previously proposed growth law reproduced measured dyssynchronously induced asymmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and the associated functional changes, when combined with a computational model of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> leads to a step increase in LV mechanical discoordination that continues to increase as the heart remodels despite the constant electrical dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
