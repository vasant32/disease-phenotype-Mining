<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized to either general anesthesia plus epidural (GAE) (n = 109) or general anesthesia only (GA) (n = 117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was length of postoperative hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, inotropic support, intubation time, perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, neurologic events, intensive care stay, pain scores, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient died in the GAE group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median postoperative stay was significantly reduced in the GAE, compared with the GA, group (5 days, interquartile range [5-6] vs. 6 days, interquartile range [5-7], hazard ratio = 1.39, 95% CI [1.06-1.82]; P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the median intubation time were both significantly lower in the GAE, compared with the GA, group (odds ratio = 0.41, 95% CI [0.22-0.78], P = 0.006 and hazard ratio = 1.73, 95% CI [1.31-2.27], P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the GAE group were more likely to need vasoconstrictors intraoperatively than in the GA group (odds ratio = 2.50, 95% CI [1.22-5.12]; P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The GAE, compared with GA, group reported significantly lower levels of impairment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pain domains and reduced <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> usage (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% CI [0.03-0.17]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery, the addition of thoracic epidural to general anesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and improves pain control and overall quality of recovery, allowing earlier extubation and hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
