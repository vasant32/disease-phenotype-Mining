<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of these antibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> and their clinical and histopathological significance has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sera from 212 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> were screened for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and histopathological features of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibody-positive patients were analysed and statistically compared with those of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibody-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients positive for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies (seven patients with and 17 patients without primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>) were identified (11.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had a clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease course of &gt;12 months before their diagnosis at hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of these 13 patients (four asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003236'>increased creatine kinase</z:hpo> levels and two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) had not been aware of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As complications, eight patients had cardiac involvement including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>; two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>; and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>), six patients had moderately decreased ejection fraction and six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002792'>decreased vital capacity</z:hpo>, two of whom required respiratory support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding muscle histopathological findings, in addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> and six had granulomatous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that the clinical features of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease course, cardiac involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo>, and the histopathological features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathic changes</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002500'>granulomatous inflammation</z:mp>, were significantly more frequently observed in patients with anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibody-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo> than in patients who were negative for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Except for cardiac involvement, which is more frequently observed in patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo>, no significant differences in clinical or histopathological features were found between patients with or without primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> associated with anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies were frequently found in patients with the clinical features of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease course, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle atrophy</z:hpo> and cardiopulmonary involvement, and the characteristic histopathological feature of <z:mp ids='MP_0002500'>granulomatous inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathies</z:hpo> associated with anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> antibodies form a characteristic subgroup </plain></SENT>
