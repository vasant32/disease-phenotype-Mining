<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We describe two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who were referred for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients possessed factors causing the conventional transvenous approach to be undesirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore devised a technique which circumvented both intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> lead placement, as well as placement of leads across the tricuspid valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For both patients, a bipolar pace-sense lead was successfully placed in a branch of the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A shocking coil was then tunneled from the posterolateral margin of the device pocket, being positioned posterior and inferior to the cardiac silhouette </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defibrillation testing was carried out with goal of a 10-J safety margin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We were able to successfully achieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in both patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> without requirement for surgical thoracotomy or a lead across the AV valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R waves in excess of 5 mV were obtained and acceptable defibrillation characteristics were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients are doing well after mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A new implant approach is presented, which involves minimal intravascular hardware and eliminates passage across the atrioventricular valve for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> in whom conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant techniques may be undesirable or not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This procedure is technically straightforward with proper technique and knowledge of the patient specific <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
