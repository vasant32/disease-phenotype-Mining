<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stepwise ablation is an effective treatment for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), although it often requires multiple procedures to eliminate recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated single- and multiple-procedure long-term success rates and potential predictors of a favorable single-procedure outcome of stepwise ablation for persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study comprised 395 patients with persistent AF (duration 16 months) undergoing de novo catheter ablation using the stepwise approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was defined as the absence of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics and electrophysiological parameters were analyzed with respect to single- and multiple-procedure outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a follow-up of 27 ± 7 months, 108 (27%) patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences with a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2.3 ± 0.6 procedures, 312 (79%) patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with concomitant antiarrhythmic treatment in 38% (23% on β-blocker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female gender, duration of persistent AF, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> were predictive for the outcome after first ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the strongest predictors for single-procedure success were longer baseline AF cycle length (CL) and procedural AF termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, procedural AF termination during the index procedure also predicted a favorable outcome after the last procedure, while the existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk for eventual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Single-procedure long-term success is anticipated in approximately a quarter of patients undergoing de novo ablation of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline AFCL emerged as the strongest predictor of single-procedure success, while AF termination during index ablation predicts the overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, an overall success rate of 79% is achievable with multiple procedures </plain></SENT>
