<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 31 patients with local advanced upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> underwent lobectomy and radical complete dissection of bilateral superior mediastinal lymph node through a median sternotomy (the sternotomy group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sternotomy group consisted of 8 females and 23 males, from 35 to 75 years old (average 57 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent superior vena caval replacement or partial excision, 21 underwent upper sleeve lobectomy, and 6 patients combined with right pulmonary artery sleeve angioplasty or partial resection and reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the 30 patients who were operated through posterolateral incision, the surgery time, complications, and prognosis during the same period (the posterolateral incision group) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average operation time in the sternotomy group was (170±30)min, while that in the posterolateral incision group was (140±30) min(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications comprised <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the sternotomy group it was 6.5%(2/31), 16.1%(5/31), and 6.5% (2/31),and that in the posterolateral incision group 3.3%(1/30), 20%(6/30), 10.0%(3/30),respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative pathological findings demonstrated the rate for pN3 disease in the sternotomy group was 29%(9/31), 2 patients died of brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> respectively 10 or 11 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 3 year survival rate of 9 patients with pN3 diagnosed as cN2 preoperatively was 33.3%(3/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total survival rate of 1,3 years in the sternotomy group was 90.3%(28/31) and 41.9%(13/31), in the posterolateral incision group 86.6%(26/30) and 40.0%(12/30),respectively(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Median sternotomy helps to resect local advanced upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> completely and to dissect bilateral mediastinal lymph node, and it can also provide more complete postoperative lymph node staging with no significant increase in complications </plain></SENT>
