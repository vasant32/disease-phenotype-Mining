<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We assessed the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vagal (vagus_stim) and sympathetic stimulation (symp_stim) on atrial conduction, atrial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> refractoriness and inducibility of AF in an in vivo rabbit model with preserved autonomic innervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open-epicardial approach was used in 17 anesthetized and artificially ventilated New Zealand white rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ECG was recorded with bipolar subcutaneous electrodes placed in the four limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrograms were obtained with four monopolar electrodes placed epicardially along the atria, and a circular electrode adapted to the proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cervical vagus nerve and thoracic sympathetic trunk were stimulated with bipolar electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epicardial activation was recorded in sinus rhythm, and effective refractory periods (ERPs) and conduction times from the high-lateral right atrium (RA) to the high-lateral left atrium (LA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> were quantified at baseline and during vagus_stim, symp_stim, or combined vagal and sympathetic stimulation (dual_stim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Burst pacing (50 Hz, 10 s), alone or combined with vagus_stim, symp_stim or dual_stim, was performed in the right (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> to test for AF inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, ERPs were higher in the LAA and there was a delay in the conduction time from RA to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, compared to the mean activation time from RA to LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During vagus_stim or dual_stim, ERP decreased significantly at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites, and baseline interatrial activation times changed from 20 +/- 4 ms to 30 +/- 10 ms and 31 +/- 11 ms, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symp_stim resulted in a significant decrease in ERPs only in the LAA, and a reduction of the interatrial interval to 16 +/- 11 ms (p &lt; 0.05 vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF inducibility ranged from 35% to 53% with baseline 50 Hz pacing, 65% to 76% during vagus_stim or symp_stim, and 75% to 100% with dual_stim (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AF duration increased significantly during ANS stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In two-thirds of the animals with longer inducible AF, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ceased immediately after cessation of vagus_stim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the fully innervated rabbit heart in vivo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ANS stimulation shortens atrial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> refractoriness, and significantly changes atrial conduction times, promoting AF induction and prolonging the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This underscores the importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> variations in ANS tone and its interactions in the pathophysiology of AF </plain></SENT>
