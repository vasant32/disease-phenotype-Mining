<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously performed a trial of intravenous landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> during and after cardiac surgery (the PASCAL trial) and demonstrated a preventive effect on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of increasing the dose and administration period of landiolol for prevention of postoperative AF, as well as the effect of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to 3 groups: a group receiving intravenous landiolol perioperatively at 5 Î¼g/kg/min for 3 days (group L), a group receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> postoperatively together with landiolol (group LB), and a control group without beta-blocker therapy (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the presence/absence of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were (1) the early clinical outcome, (2) hemodynamics, (3) cardiac enzymes (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase isoenzyme MB, troponin-I, and human heart fatty acid-binding protein), (4) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and pentraxin-3, (5) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and (6) brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative AF occurred in 14.5% of group L, 9.1% of group LB, and 35.3% of group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was observed between groups LB and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher levels of troponin-I, human heart fatty acid-binding protein, hs-CRP, pentraxin-3, and ADMA were noted in group C than in groups L and LB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Landiolol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> prevented postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects of these beta-blockers presumably inhibited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AF </plain></SENT>
