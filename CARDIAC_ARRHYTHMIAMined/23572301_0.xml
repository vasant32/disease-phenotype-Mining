<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure is used in a variety of ailments, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyse the incidence of plasmapheresis-related complications in patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The analysis involved 370 plasmapheresis procedures in 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were collected from patients` medical records, including procedure protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common diseases treated with plasmapheresis included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis (33.3%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</z:e> (14%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014518" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TEN">Lyell's syndrome</z:e> (9.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (7.4%), and thrombotic thromcytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adverse side effects observed most frequently during plasma filtration were decreases in arterial blood pressure (8.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (3.5%), sensations of cold with temporarily elevated temperature and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> (1.1%, each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the symptoms were mild and transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe and life-threatening episodes, i.e. shock, drops in arterial blood pressure requiring <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> administration, persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and haemolysis, developed in 2.16% of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasmapheresis can be considered a relatively safe method of treatment of ICU patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous observation and proper monitoring of patients provided by highly trained medical personnel are essential for its safety </plain></SENT>
