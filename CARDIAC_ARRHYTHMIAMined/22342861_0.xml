<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>), a spatial displacement of the ventricles and the target ablation site with respect to the sinus rhythm (SR) position is observed during mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze this displacement and its relevance for image integration and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The electroanatomical activation maps (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAMs</z:e>) of 55 consecutive patients who underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> ablation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial displacement between each point position during <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and SR was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 6923 points from 71 EAMs were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the median distance between the point position during SR and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the points was 9.42 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 6.19-12.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> points from the right ventricle showed more displacement than did those from the left ventricle: 10.35 mm (IQR: 7.16-13.95) vs 7.62 mm (IQR: 5.20-10.81); P &lt;.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ventricular end-diastolic volume of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> during SR was greater than that during <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> (median difference: 9.75 [IQR: 0.37-19.67] mL; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shorter coupling interval of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> was associated with greater spatial displacement (r = -.521; P &lt;.001), higher end-diastolic volume reduction with respect to the SR beat (r = -.718; P = .001), and worse image integration (mean point-to-surface distance between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> and 3-dimensional computed tomography-derived structure; r = -.642; P = .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant spatial displacement between the point position in SR and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>, mainly in the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This displacement increases with the shortening of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> coupling interval and can result in poorer image fusion and difficult catheter navigation/positioning for ablation </plain></SENT>
