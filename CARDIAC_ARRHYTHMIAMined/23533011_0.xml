<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> is hindered by the frequent occurrence of metabolic and cardiovascular side effects, resulting in worsened quality of life and greater mortality as a result of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> patients than the comparable general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo>, impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with variable frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> appear to have several advantages over first-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, including a claimed better action on cognitive function and the negative symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, and lower frequency of extrapyramidal side effects; however, their use is associated with a greater frequency of metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of these important side effects are not well understood, and generic approaches (psychoeducational programmes and symptomatic therapies) have been proposed to limit their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive data from the literature indicate that autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunction-intrinsic to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and strongly exacerbated by antipsychotic treatment-is the cause of the pervasive metabolic and vascular dysfunctions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article, we marshal further literature data to argue that the metabolic and cardiovascular side effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> are primarily mediated by their ability to block peripheral <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> receptors, which physiologically modulate sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also propose that these effects might be overcome by providing peripheral dopaminergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
