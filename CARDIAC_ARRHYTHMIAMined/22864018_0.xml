<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although landiolol is useful in the emergency management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, as well as in perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> control, the influence of hemodynamic changes on the pharmacokinetics of landiolol is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the influence of hemodynamic variation and the following hepatocirculatory changes after systemic heparinization on the pharmacokinetics of landiolol in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output and cardiac index (CI) were continuously monitored in 19 patients using an arterial pressure-based cardiac output monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle and right hepatic venous blood flow indexes (mHVBFI and rHVBFI) were measured by transesophageal echocardiography, and hemodynamic data were collected at points (T1-T3) as follows: T1, before administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and after sternotomy; T2, just before systemic heparinization (300 U/kg); T3, 10 min after T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of landiolol was measured by HPLC at the same point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, mean arterial blood pressure, CI, mHVBFI, and rHVBFI were significantly decreased (&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was not significantly changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After systemic heparinization, the landiolol concentration was significantly decreased from 0.407±0.251 µg·mL(-1) to 0.232±0.207 µg·mL(-1) (&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between T1 and T2 (=0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the plasma concentration of landiolol was decreased by diminished CI due to systemic heparinization, but not affected by the change of hepatic blood flow </plain></SENT>
