<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Background: The endpoint of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if sinus rhythm (SR) as endpoint of persistent AF ablation has a better long-term outcome compared to atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) or AF at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2011, 191 consecutive patients undergoing de novo catheter ablation for symptomatic persistent and long-standing persistent AF using a sequential ablation approach (including pulmonary vein isolation, ablation of complex fractionated electrograms and linear lesions) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the result at the end of ablation procedure, patients were classified into 3 groups: patients with termination of AF into SR (Group 1, n = 62), patients with AT undergoing cardioversion (CV) (Group 2, n = 47), or patients with AF undergoing CV (Group 3, n = 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drugs at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, estimated proportions of patients free from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence were 42% for Group 1, 13% for Group 2, and 25% for Group 3 (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a Cox regression analysis only termination into SR was associated with a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence (HR: 0.62; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: If SR is achieved as endpoint of persistent and long-standing persistent AF ablation using a sequential ablation approach it is associated with the highest long-term single procedure success rate compared to AT or AF at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
