<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study was conducted on 20 pts (6 women, 51,4±13,6 years of age) with paroxysmal AF underwent index RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pts were divided into two age-sex-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> history duration-antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD)-matched groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first group consisted of 10 pts (3 women, mean age - 51,1±11,9, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> - 3,2±1,2 years) in whom ablation strategy consisted of PVI using LASSO technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second group concluded of 10 pts (3 women, mean age - 51,1±12,9, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>- 3,1±1,1 years) in whom ablation strategy consisted of wide-area circumferential lines application around pulmonary veins, combined to roof line and mitral isthmus RFA using three-dimensional mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mathematical phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the first step numeric reconstruction of the autowave process in excitable tissues of the left atrium and the simulation of AF was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation was used for simulation to enabled us to take into account the electrical inhomogeneity of the atria (pulmonary vein ostia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A special scanning method was used for calculating characteristics of autowave processes in a two-dimensional mathematical model of the atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As the second step simulation of circular (corresponding to LASSO approach) and linear ablation (corresponding to 3D approach) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no complications associated with RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>7 pts of the first group vs 4 pts of the second subgroup had early recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AAD free sinus rhythm incidence in the first/second groups was 80%/20% at 12 months respectively (p=0,003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mathematical phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>While circular LASSO-like ablation pattern was used, there was no elimination of 4-waves re-entry turning around the pulmonary veins ostia and vortex waves caused by them in a distributed two-dimensional atrial medium after time period equal to the re-entry period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, the circular ablation formatting does not affect peripulmonary veins re-entry and, therefore, does not suppress AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, linear ablation patterns suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> caused by 4-waves re-entry in two-dimensional mathematical modeling of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mathematical approach using linear ablation to simulate suppressed 4-waves re-entry more effectively comparing to PVI only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Clinical results are consistent with ablation formatting data obtained by means of 4-waves re-entry simulation in a two-dimensional mathematical modeling of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
