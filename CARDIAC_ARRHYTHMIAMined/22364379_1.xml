<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) is a free radical scavenger, and may attenuate this pathophysiologic response and reduce the incidence of postoperative AF (POAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether NAC could effectively prevent POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of NAC supplementation on the prevention of POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medline and Embase were systematically reviewed for studies published up to November 2011, in which NAC was compared with controls for adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures comprised the incidence of POAF and hospital length of stay (LOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis was performed with the fixed-effect model or random-effect model according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight randomized trials incorporating 578 patients provided the best evidence and were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NAC supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of POAF (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93; P = 0.021) compared with controls, but had no effect on LOS (WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.28; P = 0.703) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prophylactic NAC supplementation may effectively reduce the incidence of POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the overall quality of current studies is poor and further research should focus on adequately powered randomized controlled trials with POAF incidence as a primary outcome measure </plain></SENT>
