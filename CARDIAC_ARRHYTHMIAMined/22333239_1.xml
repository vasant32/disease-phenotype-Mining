<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 260 WCTs from 204 patients with proven diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SN, SP, ACC, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were determined for the five methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 260 tracings, there were 159 VTs and 101 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five methods were found to have a similar ACC although the RWPT had a lower ACC than the Brugada algorithm (68.8 vs. 77.5%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RWPT had lower (60%) SN than the Brugada (89.0%), Griffith (94.2%), and Bayesian (89%) algorithms (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Griffith algorithm showed lower (39.8%) SP than the RWPT (82.7%), Brugada (59.2%), and Bayesian (52.0%) algorithms (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive LRs for a VT diagnosis for the RWPT criterion and the Brugada, Bayesian, aVR, and Griffith algorithms were 3.46, 2.18, 1.86, 1.67, and 1.56, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study is the first independent 'head-to-head' comparison of several WCT differentiation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five algorithms/criteria had rather moderate ACC, and that the newer methods were not more accurate than the classic Brugada algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the algorithms/criteria differed significantly in terms of SN, SP, and LR, suggesting that the value of a diagnosis may differ depending on the method used </plain></SENT>
