<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement in systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (SSc) is a frequent visceral complication that considerably affects the prognosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic hallmark is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> which can progress leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, right and/or left heart dysfunction and failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms range from unusual to prominent and from mild to dramatic, but clinically overt disease is a poor prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary myocardial involvement is related to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e>, and the available data supports that microvascular functional and structural abnormalities rather than macrovascular coronary involvement represent the main underlying mechanism of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the existence and prevalence of atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in SSc remains to be determined, as several studies have generated conflicting reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the lack of effective targeted therapy for SSc itself, sensitive and quantitative techniques have demonstrated the ability of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> to improve myocardial function and perfusion and to prevent the evolution of subclinical heart involvement to decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further research will provide a better understanding of the disease by detecting the potent contribution of coronary artery involvement, explaining differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> between SSc and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, and opening directions for the development of novel treatment strategies for this life-threatening complication of SSc </plain></SENT>
