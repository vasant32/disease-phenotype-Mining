<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, limited information is available about the role of preoperative echocardiographic left atrial evaluation to predict AF occurrence after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we prospectively compared the ability of echocardiographic measurements of left atrial volume to predict AF in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January to December 2009, 220 patients (75% males, 66.8 ± 10.0 years) met the inclusion criteria of our study (isolated and elective CABG, no valve surgery, no permanent AF, or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The day before CABG a complete echocardiographic evaluation was performed with left atrial volume measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the study was postoperative AF (POAF) lasting &gt;30 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: POAF was observed in 61 patients (27.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>POAF patients showed increased left atrial M-mode anteroposterior dimension (41.2 ± 6.4 mm vs. 43.6 ± 7.3 mm; p = 0.020) and increased left atrial volume (59.0 ± 18.3 mL vs. 70.6 ± 28.1 mL; p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left atrial volume was an independent risk factor for POAF (OR 10.03; 95% CI 10.01 to 10.05; p = 0.01), along with postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels below 8 g/dL (OR 20.84; 95% CI 10.12 to 70.19; p = 0.03) and preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% (OR 10.08; 95% CI 10.01 to 10.15; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy exerted a protective role (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.74; p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of patients with isolated CABG demonstrated that left atrium volume measurements were independently correlated to the occurrence of POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations should focus on the opportunity to target prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatments to patients with large left atrial volumes </plain></SENT>
