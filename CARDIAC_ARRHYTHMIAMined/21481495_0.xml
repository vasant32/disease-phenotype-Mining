<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 69 consecutive patients treated with (131)I for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNG</z:chebi> during the year 2008 observed for six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a single fixed dose of 16 mCi (592 MBq) weighted by the gland size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were categorized into two groups: subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> or clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the success rate and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The thyroid dysfunction was corrected in 82.09% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success rate was 100% in the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> group and 78.13% in the subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> group (P=0.105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> was 16.42%; 25.00% of patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and 14.55% with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> developed this secondary effect (P=0.400) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found in the success rate in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> when the results were analyzed according to the thyrotropin decrease in patients with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> was significantly higher in them (57.14% vs 11.67%; P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were four times more frequent in patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Previous treatment with thiamazol positively affected the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single fixed weighted dose of (131)I is highly effective and safe for the control of clinical and subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with anti-TPO antibodies may have a high risk of developing post-<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
