<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the prevalence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) malfunction among patients with a previously implanted pacemaker admitted to the hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients with a previously implanted pacemaker admitted to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our hospital admission database for patients who had both keywords "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>" and "pacemaker" as their diagnoses from January 1, 1995 until June 1, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-two patients who were admitted to the hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and had a PPM implanted prior to the index syncopal episode were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had pacemakers interrogated during the admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent physicians examined the discharge summary of each patient and determined the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 162 patients studied, eight (4.9%) were found to have pacemaker system malfunction as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 96 patients (59.2%), the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> could not be determined prior to hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the identifiable causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> was most prevalent (16%) followed by vasovagal (6%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (4.3%), atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (3.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (3.1%), and other less prevalent causes (3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, PPM system malfunction was rarely a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients admitted to the hospital with a previously implanted device </plain></SENT>
