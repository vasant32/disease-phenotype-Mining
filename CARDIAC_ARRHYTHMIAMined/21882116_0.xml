<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different disorders will require different treatment strategies and there is often an important ontogenetic aspect on how and when treatment can be implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the limited availability there is a general lack of knowledge on how pharmacotherapy can be provided in the most efficient way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Until recently most knowledge about how different drugs are transferred and metabolized in the human fetus is based on very limited observational studies on concentrations of drugs in fetal blood and other fetal compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It might be that the rapid development of other non-invasive methods for fetal diagnostics such as isolation of fetal DNA and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in maternal serum, NMR imaging and other techniques could in the future be explored in fetal pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Introduction of new treatment strategies are often based on extrapolation from experience in neonates and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However some fetal conditions are very specific for this time period in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This especially entails disturbances in development as malformations, early growth restriction and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here it might be required to introduce new treatment strategies without any previous experience in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Example of this ethical dilemma is gene therapy for lung growth in severe cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo> and early growth restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk-benefit issues need to be discussed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it is likely that the concept of the human fetus as a potential patient is still in its infancy and with an improved understanding about fetal patho-<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> there will be a continued need for better knowledge of pharmacotherapy during this crucial time period in life </plain></SENT>
