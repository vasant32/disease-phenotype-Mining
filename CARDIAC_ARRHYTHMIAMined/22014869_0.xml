<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to describe a case report and discuss a possible anatomical explanation of the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thoracic outlet syndrome</z:e> (TOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 60-year-old man experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> when he turned his head to the left and had these symptoms for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient attributed his symptoms to TOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was triggered while performing an Adson test during the clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The Grostic procedure as a measure of analysis of the biomechanical relationship of C1 to C0 and the lower cervical spine was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to this analysis, the patient had a right laterality <z:mpath ids='MPATH_79'>malposition</z:mpath> of the atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-velocity, low-amplitude manipulations (adjustments) were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient's symptoms improved after one visit and demonstrated resolution upon evaluation at the third visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the year following the initial presentation, he has had minor recurrent short-lived episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that abated with the atlas manipulation/adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of published reports describing the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through manipulative methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This appears to be the first case that describes the successful amelioration of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with TOS using chiropractic adjustment of the atlas vertebra as the sole intervention </plain></SENT>
