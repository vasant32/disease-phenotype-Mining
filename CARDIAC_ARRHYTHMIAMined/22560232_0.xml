<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Strict <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting has been shown to decrease infectious complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine if strict <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control reduced morbidity after lower extremity bypass (LEB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective pilot study at a single institution within the Vascular Study Group of New England was conducted from January 2009 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and without undergoing LEB were placed on an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion for 3 days after surgery with titration of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> from 80 to 150 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IV insulin study group (n = 104) was compared to a historic control group (n = 189) that received standard insulin treatment from the preceding 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Fisher exact test, t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Ï‡(2), and logistic regression analyses were used to compare in-hospital morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses were conducted to determine if findings differed based on the presence or absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in postoperative complications between the two groups with regard to graft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, dysrhythmia, primary patency at discharge, or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the IV insulin group had significantly fewer in-hospital wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (4% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.96; P = .047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association strengthened after adjusting for potentially confounding baseline differences in gender, body mass index, and smoking status (adjusted OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.84; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When stratified by presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were decreased in the IV insulin group (0/44 [0%] vs 9/90 [10%]; P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with IV insulin, there was no significant difference in wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (7% vs 12%; P = .42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Strict <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control with a postoperative insulin infusion protocol significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative in-hospital wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the diabetic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These previously unreported findings from this single-institution prospective study warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
