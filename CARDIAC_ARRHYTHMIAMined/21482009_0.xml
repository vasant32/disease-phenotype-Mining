<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment (32-34°C) in survivors after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (CA) is clearly recommended by the current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of cooling procedure towards QT interval have not been evaluated so far outside of case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study 34 consecutive survivors after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> were continuously monitored with Holter ECG over the first 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 34 patients were analysed and received mild therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment (MTH) according to the current guidelines and irrespective of the initial rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At admission to hospital and in the field in case of OHCA, a 12-lead ECG was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During cooling the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was low (8.8%) and in none of the patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsade de pointes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QTc interval was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at first patient contact with EMS in the field (440.00 ms; IQR 424.25-476.75; n=17) but during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment the QTc interval was significantly prolonged at 33°C after 24h of cooling (564.47 ms; IQR 512.41-590.00; p=0.0001; n=34) and decreased after end of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> to baseline levels (476.74 ms; 448.71-494.97; p=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The QTc interval was found to be significantly prolonged during MTH treatment, and some severe prolongations &gt;670 ms were observed, without a higher incidence of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsade des pointes</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, routine and frequent ECG recording with respect to the QTc interval should become part of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> standard operation protocol and should be recommended by official guidelines </plain></SENT>
