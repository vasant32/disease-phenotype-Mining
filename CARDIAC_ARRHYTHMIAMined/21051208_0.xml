<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their electrocardiograms may show several alterations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns, many of them related to the QT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various diastolic and systolic abnormalities are frequently reported in diabetic patients, and the severity of the abnormalities depend on the patients' age and the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this experimental study has been to clarify the progressive effects on heart rhythm in neonatal alloxan (ALX) (induced at 5 days of age) diabetic male rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac biopotential data were acquired in vivo with a biotelemetry system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After an overnight fast blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in diabetic rats, compared to age-matched controls, was elevated before and at 60, 120 and 180min after a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> challenge at 2 and 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and heart rate variability were modestly reduced and QT interval modestly prolonged in diabetic rats, compared to controls, at 2, 6 and 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also an age-dependent decline in heart rate and prolongation in QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 8 months heart rate was 296±8bpm in diabetic compared to 311±10bpm in controls and heart rate variability was 27±3bpm in diabetic rats compared to 32±4bpm in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physical activity was significantly reduced in diabetic rats, compared to controls, at 6 and 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was modestly reduced in diabetic rats, compared to controls, at 2, 6 and 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the neonatal ALX-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was associated with disturbances in heart rate, heart rate variability, QT interval which in turn may be associated with changes in physical activity and body temperature </plain></SENT>
