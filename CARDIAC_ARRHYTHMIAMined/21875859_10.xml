<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to evaluate whether heart rate (HR) reduction with ivabradine can translate into increased HQoL in parallel to a reduction of primary outcomes in SHIFT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In symptomatic patients with systolic HF treated with recommended background therapy, HQoL was assessed by Kansas City <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> Questionnaire (KCCQ) containing the following dimensions: overall summary score (OSS) and clinical summary score (CSS), analysed at baseline, and 4, 12, and 24 months, and last post-baseline visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 1944 patients (968 ivabradine, 976 placebo) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, incidence of clinical events (cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospital admission for HF) was inversely associated with KCCQ scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine reduced HR by 10.1 bpm (placebo-corrected, P &lt; 0.001) and improved KCCQ by 1.8 for CSS and 2.4 for OSS (placebo-corrected, P = 0.02 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively); these changes were associated with the change in HR for both CSS (P &lt; 0.001) and OSS (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship was found in both allocation groups though the changes were more pronounced in the ivabradine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life at follow-up was better preserved in the ivabradine group compared with placebo; poorest outcomes were seen in the placebo group with lowest KCCQ scores (&lt;50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with systolic HF, low HQoL is associated with an increased rate of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospital admission for HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction in HR with ivabradine is associated with improved HQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of HR reduction is related to the extent of improvement in HQoL </plain></SENT>
