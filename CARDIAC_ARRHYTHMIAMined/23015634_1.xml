<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at exploring the complication rate and corresponding risk factors in a high-volume centre with routine use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In total 1192 consecutive AF ablation procedures (100% ICE-guided; 96.4% 3D-navigated; point-by-point radiofrequency ablation with open-irrigated tip catheter; 22.4% robotic navigation; 25.4% repeated ablation) were performed in 959 patients (aged 58 Â± 9 years; 70.8% males; 35.9% persistent AF) between March 2006 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablation endpoint in paroxysmal AF was complete electrical pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex ablation was defined as PVI plus stepwise strategy for left atrial substrate ablation (43.5%) in persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty major complications (3.3%) during the procedure or within the 3 month follow-up were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or atrioesophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (0.25%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011851'>hemopericardium</z:hpo> and five patients (0.42%) had cerebrovascular embolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular injury was the most frequent (2.3%) complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>Low body weight</z:hpo> was the only significant risk factor with 0.8% increase of complication rate per 10 kg of body weight decrease (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A trend for increase in complication rate was also observed for advanced age, female gender, and complex procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation procedures guided by ICE in a high-volume centre are associated with low rate of serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The composite risk score consisting of body weight, age, gender, and complexity of procedure predicted complications </plain></SENT>
