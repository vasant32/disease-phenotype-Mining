<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sedation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> combined with traditional sedative agents (PTSA) for gastrointestinal endoscopy, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PTSA with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-alone sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: RCTs comparing the effects of PTSA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> alone during gastrointestinal endoscopy were found on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary complications (i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>), total dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> used and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine original RCTs investigating a total of 1,505 patients, of whom, 805 received PTSA sedation and 700 received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-alone sedation, met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-alone sedation, the pooled relative risk with the use of PTSA sedation for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the procedures combined was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.30-2.92), 1.32 (95% CI, 0.38-4.64), 2.61 (95% CI, 0.23-29.29) and 2.81 (95% CI, 0.27-29.07), with no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pooled mean difference in total dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> used was -40.01 (95% CI, -78.96 to -1.05), which showed a significant reduction with use of PTSA sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.88-1.07), suggesting no significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTSA sedation during gastrointestinal endoscopy could significantly reduce the total dose of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, but without benefits of lower risk of cardiopulmonary complications compared with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-alone sedation </plain></SENT>
