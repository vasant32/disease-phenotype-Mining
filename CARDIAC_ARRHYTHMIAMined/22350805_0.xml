<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To achieve linear delivery of a highly water-soluble oral drug, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, with a nanofibrous sheet-based system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The nanofibrous sheets made of poly (lactic-co-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17497">glycolic acid</z:chebi>) were used as a diffusion barrier to cap a tablet containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For controlled drug delivery, we varied the sheet thickness to 20 μm, 50 μm and 80 μm to give the capped drug tablets, 20CT, 50CT and 80CT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Drug release was more sustained as the sheet thickness increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the periods for almost complete drug release could be extended up to 14 h with the 80 μm-thick sheets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As we assessed the linear least square fits to the in vitro drug release data from the capped tablets, 20CT and 50CT showed a fairly good correlation with linear release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The periods of linear release were 6 h and 8 h for 20CT and 50CT, respectively, both releasing more than 85% drug during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that a drug tablet capped with nanofibrous sheets is a promising system for linear delivery of a highly water-soluble oral drug </plain></SENT>
