<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in dogs with refractory supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to document the side effects in treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of 28 dogs were retrospectively searched to document indication for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> administration, heart rate, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone values before and after starting treatment and during follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen dogs with supraventricular and 12 dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced the heart rate (P&lt;0.001) and resulted in improvement in the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and clinical signs in 26 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in alkaline phosphatase (P=0.596), alanine aminotransferase (P=0.842), T4 (P=0.789) and thyroid stimulating hormone (P=0.064) before and after starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On maintenance therapy, median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> blood levels were within the accepted reference range (0.5 to 2.0 mg/L) at 0.8 mg/L (range 0.2 to 11.6 mg/L), but the majority of the desethylamiodarone levels were below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at 0.1 mg/L (range 0.1 to 0.9 mg/L), based on human reference intervals (0.5 to 2.0 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> may be an effective and safe alternative to treat supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in dogs, when common anti-arrhythmic drugs are not effective or contraindicated </plain></SENT>
