<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical decision making regarding the appropriateness of mitral-valve surgery vs. CRT is a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the prevalence and prognosis of various degrees of functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in CRT candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we sought to identify functional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients who either can be adequately managed by CRT only or will need surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients (n= 794) were followed-up for 26 ± 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> severity was quantified on scale 0-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy responders were identified based on improvement in the New York Heart Association class and left-ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and LV reverse remodelling were assessed at 3 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predictors of long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> change and CRT response were explored with multivariable models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> was present in 86%, with 35% prevalence of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (grade 3-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> ≥ 1° after 12 months occurred in 46% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was relatively more frequent in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> at baseline (63%, P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> severity and change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> at 3-month follow-up predicted response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with ≥ 1° <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> improvement at 12 months had more reverse remodelling compared with those with no change or worsening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> improvement at 3 months predicts CRT response and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> improvement at 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This finding could have implications for subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> surgical therapies </plain></SENT>
