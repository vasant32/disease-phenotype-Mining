<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total atrial conduction time (PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration) has been identified as an independent predictor of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess whether PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration is a predictor of AF after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 128 patients who had undergone CABG, preoperative clinical and echocardiographic data were compared between patients with and without POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration was assessed by measuring the time interval between the beginning of the P wave on the surface ECG and point of the peak A wave on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> from left atrium (LA) lateral wall just over the mitral annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with POAF (38/128, 29.6 %) were older (68.1 ± 11.1 vs. 59.3 ± 10.2 years; p &lt; 0.001), had higher LA maximum volume, had prolonged PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration, and had lower ejection fraction compared with patients without POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration was found to be significantly increased in POAF group (134.3 ± 19.7 vs. 112.5 ± 17.7 ms; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, age (95 % CI = 1.03-1.09; p = 0.003), LA maximum volume (95 % CI = 1.01-1.06; p = 0.03), and prolonged PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration (95 % CI, 1.02-1.05; p = 0.001) were found to be the independent risk factors of POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, LA maximum volume and PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration were found to be the independent predictors of the development of POAF after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic predictors of left atrial electromechanical dysfunction may be useful in risk stratifying of patients in terms of POAF development after CABG </plain></SENT>
