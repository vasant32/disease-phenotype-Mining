<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> has a genetic component, the underlying genetic factors are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since heart rate and ECG intervals of conduction and repolarization during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> differ between patients who do and patients who do not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, we investigated whether SNPs known to modulate these ECG indices in the general population also impact on the respective ECG indices during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of participants of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Genetics in the NEtherlandS (AGNES) study, which enrols patients with a first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> that develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (cases) and patients that do not develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNPs known to impact on RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration or QTc interval in the general population were tested for effects on the respective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> ECG indices (stage 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only those showing a (suggestive) significant association were tested for association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (stage 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On average, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> cases had a shorter RR and a longer QTc interval compared to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight SNPs showed a trend for association with the respective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> ECG indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, three were also suggestively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RR interval and ECG indices of conduction and repolarization during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> differ between patients who develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and patients who do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the effects of the SNPs on ECG indices during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> seem to be similar in magnitude and direction as those found in the general population, the effects, at least in isolation, are too small to explain the differences in ECGs between cases and controls and to determine risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
