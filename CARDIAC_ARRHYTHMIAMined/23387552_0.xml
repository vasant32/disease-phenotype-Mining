<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (AA) in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) patients is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to define the mechanisms of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to evaluate the role of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with OHT referred for ablation of AA from 1999 to 2011 were included (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Entrainment and anatomic 3-D mapping were utilized to identify AA mechanism and guide ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time from OHT to ablation was 8 years (range: 1 month-16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AA types included 1 (7%) AVNRT, 5 (33%) cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) dependent donor <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFl), 3 (20%) non-CTI-dependent donor AFL (n = 3), focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) (n = 2) and in 4 (27%) recipient to donor atria conduction (RDC) that involved the right atrial anastomosis in 3 and left atrial anastamosis in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In RDC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, ablation was performed at the site of earliest donor atrial activation on the suture line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AA in the recipient atria were not targeted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most patients 12/15 (80%) only right atrial ablation was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regardless of surgical technique (bicaval vs biatrial) right-sided AA was most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success occurred in 14/15 (93%) patients and 3/15 (20%) required repeat Abl for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AA after OHT are most commonly due to atrial macroreentry, but focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and RDC atrial conduction also occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation of organized AA is usually successful with low risk, warranting early consideration in preference to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
