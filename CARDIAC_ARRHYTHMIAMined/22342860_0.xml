<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genetic factors affecting the TPE interval are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify common genetic variants that affect the duration of the TPE interval in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study on 1870 individuals of Finnish origin participating in the Health 2000 Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TPE interval was measured from T-peak to T-wave end in leads II, V(2), and V(5) on resting electrocardiograms, and the mean of these TPE intervals was adjusted for age, sex, and Cornell voltage-duration product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We sought replication for a genome-wide significant result in the 3745 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a locus on 17q24 that was associated with the TPE interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The minor allele of the common variant rs7219669 was associated with a 1.8-ms shortening of the TPE interval (P = 1.1 × 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (-1.5 ms; P = 1.3 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall effect estimate of rs7219669 in the 2 studies was -1.7 ms (P = 5.7 × 10(-14)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The common variant rs7219669 maps downstream of the KCNJ2 gene, in which rare mutations cause congenital long and short QT syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The common variant rs7219669 is associated with the TPE interval and is thus a candidate to modify repolarization-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility in individuals carrying the major allele of this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
