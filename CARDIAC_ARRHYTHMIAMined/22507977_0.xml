<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of patients presenting with HF, 30-55% have a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) rather than a reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine discriminating clinical features in new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> HFPEF vs. HFREF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 712 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e>) hospitalized for new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> HF between 1981 and 2008 (median age 81 years, 53% female), 46% had HFPEF (EF &gt;45%) and 54% had HFREF (EF â‰¤45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariable logistic regression, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), higher heart rate, higher <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> increased the odds of HFREF; female sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> increased the odds of HFPEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In aggregate, these clinical features predicted HF subtype with good discrimination (c-statistic 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictors were examined in the Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment (EFFECT) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 4436 HF patients (median age 75 years, 47% female), 32% had HFPEF and 68% had HFREF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing clinical features were consistent between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHS</z:e> and EFFECT, with comparable discrimination in EFFECT (c-statistic 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In exploratory analyses examining the traits of the intermediate EF group (EF 35-55%), CHD predisposed to a decrease in EF, whereas other clinical traits showed an overlapping spectrum between HFPEF and HFREF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple clinical characteristics at the time of initial HF presentation differed in participants with HFPEF vs. HFREF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While CHD was clearly associated with a lower EF, overlapping characteristics were observed in the middle of the left ventricular EF range spectrum </plain></SENT>
