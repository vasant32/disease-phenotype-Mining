<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct inhibition of signal transduction as a therapeutic approach presents several challenges, and a better understanding of KSHV-induced mechanisms regulating MAPK activation may facilitate the development of new treatment or prevention strategies for KS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAPK phosphatases, including dual-specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1), negatively regulate signal transduction and cytokine activation through MAPK dephosphorylation or interference with effector molecule binding to MAPKs, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that ERK-dependent latent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> gene expression, the induction of promigratory factors, and cell invasiveness following de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of primary human endothelial cells are in part dependent on KSHV suppression of DUSP1 expression during de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KSHV-encoded miR-K12-11 upregulates the expression of xCT (an amino acid transporter and KSHV fusion/entry receptor), and existing data indicate a role for xCT in the regulation of 14-3-3β, a transcriptional repressor of DUSP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that miR-K12-11 induces endothelial cell secretion of promigratory factors and cell invasiveness through upregulation of xCT-dependent, 14-3-3β-mediated suppression of DUSP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, proof-of-principle experiments revealed that pharmacologic upregulation of DUSP1 inhibits the induction of promigratory factors and cell invasiveness during de novo KSHV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data reveal an indirect role for miR-K12-11 in the regulation of DUSP1 and downstream pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
