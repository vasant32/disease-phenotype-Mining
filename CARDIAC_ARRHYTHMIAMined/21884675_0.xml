<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Wenxin Keli is a Chinese herb extract reported to be of benefit in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001853'>cardiac inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the electrophysiologic effects of Wenxin Keli in isolated canine arterially perfused right atrial preparations with a rim of right ventricular tissue (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transmembrane action potentials and a pseudoelectrocardiogram were simultaneously recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">Acetylcholine</z:chebi> (1 Î¼M) was used to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and to test the anti-AF potential of Wenxin Keli (5 g/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli produced preferential abbreviation of action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (APD(90)) in atria, but caused atrial-selective prolongation of the effective refractory period, due to the development of postrepolarization refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum rate of rise of the action potential upstroke was preferentially reduced in atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diastolic threshold of excitation increased in both atria and ventricles, but much more in atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of the "P wave" (index of atrial conduction time) was prolonged to a much greater extent than the duration of the "QRS complex" (index of ventricular conduction time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli significantly reduced I(Na) and shifted steady-state inactivation to more negative potentials in HEK293 cells stably expressing SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli prevented the induction of persistent AF in 100% atria (6/6) and, in another experimental series, was found to terminate persistent <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-mediated AF in 100% of atria (3/3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Wenxin Keli produces atrial-selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of I(Na)-dependent parameters in canine isolated coronary-perfused preparations via a unique mechanism and is effective in suppressing AF and preventing its induction, with minimal effects on the ventricular electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
