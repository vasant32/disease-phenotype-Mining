<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the commonest sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In developing countries, AF is a growing public health problem with the epidemiologic transition from communicable to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, relatively little is known about AF in the developing world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to examine in developing countries the prevalence, associated medical conditions and management of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search was conducted via MEDLINE and EMBASE (1990-2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy studies were included in the review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AF in the general population ranged from 0.03% to 1.25%, while the prevalence of AF in hospital-based studies varied from 0.7% to 55.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of AF in Africa was lower than in other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common conditions associated with AF were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (10.3%-71.9%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (5.6%-66.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with AF ranged from 6.7% to 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The utilization of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> was highly variable (2.7%-72.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the patients with AF using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> had therapeutic International Normalized Ratios (INR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a high prevalence of use of rate control therapies (55.3%-87.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The limited studies available suggest that in the developing world there is a significant prevalence of AF, which is predominantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, and carries a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Highly variable use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> may be related to different health care and socioeconomic settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>More studies are needed to improve understanding of the epidemiology and management of AF in developing countries </plain></SENT>
