<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-chain 'fish-type' <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi>, eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA), have cardioprotective anti-arrhythmic effects in animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Raising the cardiac level of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA in chickens may protect against <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, fish oil as a source of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA in poultry feed is costly and introduces undesirable properties to the meat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whilst omega-3 vegetable oils, such as canola oil, are cheaper and do not have a strong odour, they contain the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26666">short-chain fatty acid</z:chebi> α-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi>, which requires conversion to <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA after ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the capacity for dietary canola oil to elevate cardiac <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and DHA in broilers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Broilers were fed with diets containing either 3% canola oil or tallow, which is currently used in some commercial feeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upon completion of a 42 day feeding trial, canola oil significantly increased <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA in heart <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> relative to tallow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The elevation in cardiac <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA may provide anti-arrhythmic effects and protect against <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> in poultry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This proof-of-concept biochemical study suggests that a larger study to assess the clinical outcome of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> may be warranted </plain></SENT>
