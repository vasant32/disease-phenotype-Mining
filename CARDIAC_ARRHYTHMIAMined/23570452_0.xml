<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) has been extensively investigated for many years, but its pathogenesis remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ACTC1 gene was the first sarcomeric gene whose mutation was shown to cause <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>; recent studies have indicated that the HSPB7 and ZBTB17 genes are also associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the potential role of these three genes in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, we examined 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ZBTB17, HSPB7 and ACTC1 genes: namely, rs10927875 in ZBTB17; rs1739843, rs7523558, and rs6660685 in HSPB7; rs533021, rs589759, rs1370154, rs2070664, rs3759834, rs525720 and rs670957 in ACTC1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 97 DCM patients and 189 controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SNPs were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype of SNP rs10927875 in ZBTB17 (OR=5.19, 95% CI =1.00 to 27.03, P=0.05) was associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in genotype or allele frequencies in ACTC1 or HSPB7 between <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ZBTB17 polymorphism rs10927875 appears to play a role in the susceptibility of the Han Chinese population to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
