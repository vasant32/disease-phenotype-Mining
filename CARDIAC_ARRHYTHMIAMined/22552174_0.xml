<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare the predictive role of serum inflammatory markers (serum amyloid A [SAA], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) an indice of atrial strain in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> arrhythmic recurrence rate in patients with persistent AF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 57 patients with a mean LVEF of 58.7 Â± 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP, SAA and CRP levels were determined few hours before electrical cardioversion and 3 weeks after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>Subacute</z:hpo> AF recurrences were documented in 19 (33 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas NT-proBNP levels did not predict arrhythmic outcome, higher SAA (&gt; 6.16-6.19 mg/L) and CRP levels (&gt; 2.99-3.10 mg/L) were significantly associated with AF recurrences (odds ratio [OR], 5.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-18.26; P = 0.007 and OR, 14.93; 95% CI, 3.90-57.19; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both SAA (OR, 18.29; 95% CI, 2.07-161.46; P = 0.009) and high sensitivity CRP (OR, 42.03; 95% CI, 4.83-365.45; P = 0.001) through the multivariate logistic regression analysis show an independent role in predicting the AF recurrence with a sensitivity of 100% (38/38) and a specificity of 52.6% (10/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that in patients with persistent AF and preserved LVEF, SAA and CRP levels are independent predictors of AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> recurrence rate, whereas NT-proBNP, not associated with arrhythmic outcome, reflects the hemodynamic alterations secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous determination of SAA and high sensitivity CRP has a very high sensitivity (100%) in predicting the AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
