<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested whether 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi> (2-APB) induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in perfused rat hearts and whether this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> might result from the activation of voltage-independent calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rat hearts were Langendorff perfused and beat under sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An isovolumic balloon inserted into the left ventricle was used to record mechanical function while bipolar electrograms were recorded from electrodes sutured to the base and the apex of hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western and immunofluorescence analyses were performed on rat left ventricular protein extracts and left ventricular frozen sections, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat ventricular myocytes express Orai 1 and Orai 3, and ventricle also contains the Orai regulator Stim1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rat hearts (n=5) perfused with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) alone maintained sinus rhythm at 4.8 ± 0.1 Hz and stable mechanical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, perfusing hearts (n=5) with (KH+22 μM 2-APB) provoked a period of tachycardic ectopy at rates of up to 10.8 ± 0.2 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As perfusion with (KH+22 μM 2-APB) continued, the rate of spontaneous ventricular depolarization increased to 21.8 ± 1.2 Hz and became disorganized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heart mechanical function collapsed as developed pressure decreased from 87 ± 8.8 to 3.5 ± 1.9 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow rate did not change between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (16.6 ± 0.9 ml/min) and fibrillating (17.4 ± 0.8 ml/min) hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of 20 μM 1-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46881">propoxy</z:chebi>]ethyl-1H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="14434,16069">imidazole</z:chebi> (SKF-96365) to (KH+22 μM 2-APB) perfusates (n=4) restored sinus rhythm and heart mechanical output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that activating myocardial voltage-independent calcium channels, possibly the Orais, may be a novel cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
