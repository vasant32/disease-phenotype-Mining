<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although not approved for use in the pediatric population, an increasing number of reports describe its use in pediatric patients during the intraoperative period and in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">Dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> can potentially have an adverse impact on the cardiovascular system secondary to its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is these cardiac effects that are currently being explored as a therapeutic option for the treatment of perioperative tachyarrhythmias in pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (JET), which developed following cardiopulmonary bypass for surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>Tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> in a 6-week-old infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 15 min of increasing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> infusion from 0.5 to 3 μg/kg/h, JET converted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case report provides additional anecdotal evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of perioperative tachyarrhythmias in pediatric patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specific effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> on the cardiac conduction system are reviewed followed by a summary of previous reports describing its use as a therapeutic agent to treat perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
