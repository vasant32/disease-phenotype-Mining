<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Systemic cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is a serious complication, especially in patients with pacemaker (PM) dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In those patients after infectious device removal temporary pacing is necessary, to obtain adequate haemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a new therapy option with temporary pacing by ipsilateral implantation of a new active-fixation right ventricular (RV)-lead was evaluated.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between September 2009 and November 2011, infectious lead removal was performed in 17 patients with systemic CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporary pacing was achieved by simultaneous implantation of a new active-fixation RV-lead, which then was connected extracorporally to the old CIED device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic therapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laboratory infection</z:e> parameters were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and blood culture samples showed negative results, new CIED was implanted on contralateral side and temporary RV-lead was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean patients' age was 71.3 ± 9.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean C-reactive protein values were 79.3 mg/dL, and mean leucocytes counts were 12.6 × 10(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After lead extraction, temporary pacing was necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of temporary pacing was 12.7 (6-24) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major procedure-related peri- or post-operative adverse events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean time of hospitalization was 20.8 (10-48) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 21.1 months (12-36), showing survival rate of 100% and freedom from reinfection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients.CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral implantation of a temporary active-fixation RV-lead connected to an externalized PM and pursued antibiotic therapy seems to be a good option for patients with CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and PM dependency, showing no temporary pacing-related complications and no reinfection after mean follow-up time of 21.1 months </plain></SENT>
