<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data regarding the attendances and clinical diagnoses at rapid access clinics is lacking and may provide insight into their efficiency and role in providing a comprehensive referral service for primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data regarding total number of attendances and diagnoses were retrospectively analysed from databases collated by nurse specialists and physicians undertaking rapid access clinics at Charing Cross Hospital between April 2002 and March 2011 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Referrals have increased to our service which suggests that demand for a rapid access cardiology service remains high and the proportion of patients diagnosed with significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> has remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite considerable motivation towards providing primary based care this has not occurred in our local area and we believe this shows that our model, based in secondary care to be both efficient and accessible to local GPs and patients </plain></SENT>
