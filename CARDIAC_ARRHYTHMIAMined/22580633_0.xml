<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Infected device explantation is increasingly necessary given the rapid growth in cardiac rhythm management device (CRMD) implantation in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some patients with CRMD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are unlikely to be capable of paying for a new device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reassuringly, evidence suggests that reuse of cardiac devices can be safe and feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated whether explanted cardiac devices, due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, can be reimplanted safely within the same individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with CRMD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> between 2007 and 2010 were entered into a computer database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these, patients that had need for CRMD implantation and reimplantation of their infected device were analyzed for safety and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients had CRMD implantation after the infected device removal, and 44 (73.3 %) patients underwent procedures for reimplantation of their infected device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 64.8 ± 16.5 years, and 32 (72.7 %) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indications for device explantation were: pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (86.6 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (11.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 20.4 ± 9.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>Endocarditis</z:hpo> recurred in one (2.3 %) patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> at 17 months after reimplantation of a refurbished implantable cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the follow-up period secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accident</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No early battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or device malfunction was identified during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data emphasize that reimplantation of explanted CRMDs, due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, within the same individual is feasible, safe, and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reuse of explanted CRMDs is an alternative choice for people in developing countries </plain></SENT>
