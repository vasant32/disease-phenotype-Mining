<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify changes in emergency room (ER) and hospital inpatient use and in Medicare payments per beneficiary/year after pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes for pacemaker recipients after and before implantation and between pacemaker recipients and controls were compared using propensity score matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data came from Health and Retirement Study interviews merged with Medicare claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sample subjects were aged â‰¥68 years with diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e> or cardiac dysrhythmias in the previous 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were (1) ER visits, inpatient admissions and days, and Medicare payments for ER and inpatient care in the after period for the pacemaker versus control groups, defined per beneficiary/year, (2) difference in differences in the same 5 outcome variables, and (3) binary variables for whether or not utilization or payments were lower in the after versus before periods for the pacemaker versus control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, most pacemaker recipients improved, as measured by reductions in use and payments in the after versus before period, and there were reductions in ER visits and hospital admissions for conditions commonly leading to pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
