<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) on cardiac autonomic function with the parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) and investigated the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-six patients (27 women, 49 men; mean age 50.6±10.7 years; range 33 to 75 years) with an initial diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> underwent polysomnography and simultaneous Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> was based on an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) of ≥5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated with time-and frequency-based parameters of HRV, and turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) parameters of HRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were also assessed on Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (69.7%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, being mild in 25 (47.2%), moderate in 23 (43.4%), and severe in five (9.4%) patients based on the AHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups as those having an AHI of &lt;5 (n=23) and ≥5 (n=53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in HRV parameters between the two groups, but patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> exhibited a significantly higher TO (p=0.02) and a significantly lower TS (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In bivariate correlation analysis, AHI showed a significant negative correlation with TS (r=-0.37, p=0.009) and a significant positive correlation with TO (r=0.36, p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of short-sequence premature atrial and ventricular contractions were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that blunting of HRT is more prominent than changes in HRV parameters in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, accompanied by increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
