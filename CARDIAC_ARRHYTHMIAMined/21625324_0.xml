<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF has been associated with profound changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) homeostasis, which might contribute to both reduced contractile function and increased arrhythmogenesis in atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in human tissue samples and various animal models of AF have revealed changes in both expression levels and posttranslational modifications of key Ca(2+) handling proteins, which may contribute to arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we will focus on the molecular basis of alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) handling in AF and their potential therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
