<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To define the maximum tolerated dose, clinical toxicities, and pharmacodynamics of bevacizumab, everolimus, and panobinostat (LBH-589) when administered in combination to patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENT DESIGN: Subjects received 10 mg of panobinostat three times weekly, 5 or 10 mg everolimus daily, and bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed in cycle 1; toxicity evaluation was closely monitored throughout treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment continued until disease progression or undesirable toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein acetylation was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) both at baseline and on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve subjects were evaluable for toxicity and nine subjects for response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DLTs in cohort 1 included grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> and grade 3 oral mucositis; DLTs in cohort -1 were grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and grade 2 intolerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (50 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (33 %), mucositis/<z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (25 %), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (25 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (25 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 partial response; an additional 2 subjects had stable disease as best response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No consistent changes in protein acetylation in PBMC were observed in samples available from eight patients on treatment compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab, everolimus, and panobinostat in combination at the lowest proposed doses did not have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and did not consistently inhibit HDAC activity; therefore, we do not recommend further evaluation </plain></SENT>
