<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency point-by-point ablation is the gold-standard technique; however, in the last two decades, many new technologies have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic ablation system makes direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostium visualization possible, despite the large <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> variation thanks to its compliant balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The laser generator delivers precise lesions that in the first clinical studies seem to be durable, with a safety and efficacy profile similar to the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If these early results are confirmed by larger clinical studies, the endoscopic ablation system will offer a new paradigm in ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> by directly visualizing the target substrate </plain></SENT>
