<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of an expanded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (ePTFE) sheet wrapping device for patients with pacemaker contact <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the occurrence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergies</z:e> and other complications after implantation of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) wrapped with an ePTFE sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,497 procedures of CIED implantation were performed at our institution between January 1993 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 19 patients who underwent implantation of an electronic cardiac device wrapped with an ePTFE sheet, device implantation was performed in 11 patients for secondary prevention of device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011616" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">contact sensitivity</z:e>, in 7 patients for primary prevention of device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011616" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">contact sensitivity</z:e>, and in 1 patient for avoiding over-sensing of myopotentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up periods (mean 46 ± 34 months), there were no allergic or inflammatory reactions to components of the device or ePTFE itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 11 patients with a device wrapped with an ePTFE sheet for secondary prevention, 5 patients completed device replacement due to battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and 3 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> from the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Wrapping implantable devices with an ePTFE sheet is an effective way of preventing device sensitivity in patients who require CIED therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> from the device should be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
