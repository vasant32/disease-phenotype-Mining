<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) are useful biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little data are available regarding the prognostic value of hs-CRP and BNP serum levels and future ventricular arrhythmic events triggering implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 100 patients eligible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation were enrolled in a prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP were obtained the day before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and at scheduled follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For risk analysis, the study cohort was dichotomized based on serum level of hs-CRP using a cut-off value of 3 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during a follow-up of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy was delivered in 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median baseline serum level of hs-CRP was significantly higher in patients with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy than in those without appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (5.33 mg/L vs 2.19 mg/L; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same was true for median serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP during follow-up (5.43 mg/L vs 2.61 mg/L, P = 0.001 and 261.0 pg/mL vs 80.1 pg/mL, P = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that baseline hs-CRP level &gt; 3 mg/L was independently associated with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (odds ratio 4.0, 95% 1.1-14.2; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated preimplantation hs-CRP serum level is independently associated with increased risk for appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monitoring for elevated BNP levels during follow-up adds to the assessment of risk for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
