<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have examined the relation between RSA and defensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e>, a process contingent on physiological flexibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three independent samples, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> was defined as the time course of 9 startle responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Sample one and two, startle was recorded 1) while shock electrodes were attached to participants' and 2) before a threat-of-shock task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Sample three, startle was recorded without these two components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first two samples, startle magnitude significantly decreased over time but in Sample three, startle only decreased at a trend level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, low RSA was associated with less of a reduction in startle magnitude over time within the first two samples, but was unrelated to startle reduction in the third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that low RSA is associated with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> to contextual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, which may reflect difficulties regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
