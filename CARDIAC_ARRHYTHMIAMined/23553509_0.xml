<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although initially investigated as a once-daily agent, a lower than expected improvement in trough forced expiratory volume over 1 s prompted re-evaluation as a twice-daily (b.i.d.) regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose approved for use in Europe, 400 μg b.i.d., achieved statistically significant improvements in lung function, reductions in breathlessness, and improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for up to 24 weeks of treatment in the pivotal phase 3 trials (AClidinium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Respiratory Disease</z:e> I [ACCORD COPD I] [12 weeks] and Aclidinium To Treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Airway obstruction</z:e> In COPD patieNts [ATTAIN] [24 weeks]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These improvements were sustained during maintenance therapy of up to 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled data from the ATTAIN and ACCORD studies (both included a placebo arm) showed that exacerbation frequency was significantly reduced, although neither study was prospectively designed to evaluate this endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological and preclinical studies demonstrated the low systemic bioavailability of aclidinium and the low propensity to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The good tolerability of aclidinium was confirmed in the phase 3 program up to 52 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adverse event (AE) profile of the approved dose, 400 μg b.i.d., was similar to that of placebo, with a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aclidinium is delivered via the Genuair® multidose dry powder inhaler (Almirall Sofotec GmBH, Bad Homburg, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The device is simple to use with multiple feedback mechanisms ensuring consistent dose delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, aclidinium 400 μg b.i.d. is effective for the treatment of patients with COPD, offering improvements in lung function, breathlessness, and HRQoL, with a good safety profile and a low incidence of anticholinergic and cardiac AEs </plain></SENT>
