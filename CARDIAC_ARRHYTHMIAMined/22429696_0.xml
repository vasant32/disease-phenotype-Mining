<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has been proved to be effective and to prevent progressive left atrial (LA) remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryoballoon catheter ablation (CCA), using a different energy source, was developed to simplify the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that successful CCA can also prevent progressive LA remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 36 patients selected for their first CCA because of nonvalvular paroxysmal AF had echocardiography before and 3, 6 and 12 months after CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA diameters, volumes (LAV) and LA volume index (LAVI) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LA function was assessed by: early diastolic velocities of the mitral annulus (Aa(sept), Aa(lat)), LA filling fraction (LAFF), LA emptying fraction (LAEF) and the systolic fraction of pulmonary venous flow (PVSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed left ventricular diastolic function assessment was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excluding recurrences in the first 3-month blanking period, the clinical success rate was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During one-year of follow-up, recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was found in 21 patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the recurrent group at 12 months after ablation, minimal LAV (38 ± 19 to 44 ± 20 ml; p &lt; 0.05), maximal LAV (73 ± 23 to 81 ± 24 ml; p &lt; 0.05), LAVI (35 ± 10 to 39 ± 11 ml/m2; p = 0.01) and the maximal LA longitudinal diameter (55 ± 5 to 59 ± 6 mm; p &lt; 0.01) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PVSF (58 ± 9 to 50 ± 10%; p = 0.01) and LAFF (36 ± 7 to 33 ± 8%; p = 0.03) had decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after successful cryoballoon ablation LA size had not increased and LA function had not declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the recurrent group LAEF was significantly lower at baseline and at follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurred within one year after cryoballoon catheter ablation left atrial size had increased and left atrial function had declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, successful cryoballoon catheter ablation prevented progressive left atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
