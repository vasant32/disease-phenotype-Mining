<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OHCA survival from shockable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) improved in several communities after implementation of American Heart Association resuscitation guidelines that eliminated "stacked" shocks and emphasized chest compressions. "Nonshockable" rhythms are now the predominant presentation of OHCA; the benefit of such treatments on nonshockable rhythms is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 3960 patients with nontraumatic OHCA from nonshockable initial rhythms treated by prehospital providers in King County, Washington, over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes during a 5-year intervention period after adoption of new resuscitation guidelines were compared with the previous 5-year historical control period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was 1-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics and resuscitation characteristics were similar between the control (n=1774) and intervention (n=2186) groups, among whom 471 of 1774 patients (27%) versus 742 of 2186 patients (34%), respectively, achieved return of spontaneous circulation; 82 (4.6%) versus 149 (6.8%) were discharged from hospital, 60 (3.4%) versus 112 (5.1%) with favorable neurological outcome; 73 (4.1%) versus 135 (6.2%) survived 1 month; and 48 (2.7%) versus 106 patients (4.9%) survived 1 year (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Pâ‰¤0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, the intervention period was associated with an improved odds of 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.74) for return of spontaneous circulation, 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.05) for hospital survival, 1.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.18) for favorable neurological status, 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.10) for 1-month survival, and 1.85 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.66) for 1-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcomes from OHCA resulting from nonshockable rhythms, although poor by comparison with shockable rhythm presentations, improved significantly after implementation of resuscitation guideline changes, suggesting their potential to benefit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presentations of OHCA </plain></SENT>
