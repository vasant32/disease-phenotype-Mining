<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Appropriate adjustment of cardiac preload is essential to maintain cardiac output (CO), especially in patients after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was intended to determine whether index of right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDVI), corrected RVEDVI using ejection fraction (cRVEDVI), index of initial distribution volume of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IDVGI), or cardiac filling pressures are correlated with cardiac index (CI) following cardiac surgery in the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-six consecutive cardiac surgical patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (NA) group (n = 72) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (A) group (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three sets of measurements were performed: on admission to the ICU and daily on the first 2 postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between each cardiac preload variable and cardiac index (CI) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A p value less than 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each studied variable was not different between the two groups immediately after admission to the ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>cRVEDVI had a linear correlation with CI in both group (NA group: r = 0.67, n = 216, p &lt; 0.001; A group: r = 0.77, n = 42, p &lt; 0.001), but RVEDVI had a poor correlation with CI (NA group: r = 0.27, n = 216, p &lt; 0.001; A group: r = 0.19, n = 42, p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IDVGI had a linear correlation with CI (NA group: r = 0.49, n = 216, p &lt; 0.001; A group: r = 0.61, n = 42, p &lt; 0.001), Cardiac filling pressures had no correlation with CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that cRVEDVI and IDVGI were correlated with CI in the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>cRVEDVI and IDVGI have potential as indirect cardiac preload markers following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
