<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics and mortality of hemodialysis patients with AF, which are not completely elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of AF in patients undergoing hemodialysis in our institutions was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF (AF group) and without AF (control group) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group were matched for several important clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For further analysis, AF patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the type of AF (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF (CAF) and paroxysmal AF (PAF) groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients were evaluated for their clinical characteristics, laboratory data and echocardiographic parameters and prospectively followed up for 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 328 study patients, 30 had AF (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left atrial diameter (LAD) and the left ventricular mass index were significantly greater in the AF group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events were significantly higher in the AF group than in the control group, and tended to be higher in the CAF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that the prevalence of AF as 9.1% in hemodialysis patients, and that AF, especially CAF, were associated with high mortality </plain></SENT>
