<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This form of LQTS can manifest before birth or during neonatal life, and no previous report has demonstrated LQTS complicated by impaired AV conduction in elderly patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report describes an elderly patient with an acquired form of LQTS who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> that was successfully defibrillated during admission to the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic study demonstrated that HV interval was 38 milliseconds and QT interval was 635 milliseconds during sinus rhythm cycle length of 1167 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1:1 AV conduction was maintained to a pacing cycle length of 545 milliseconds with an AH interval of 144 milliseconds, HV interval of 44 milliseconds, and right ventricular monophasic action potential duration of 360 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 2:1 HV block developed at a pacing cycle length of 500 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of mexiletine decreased the cycle length of developing HV block to 360 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
