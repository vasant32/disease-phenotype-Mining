<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> for asymptomatic mutation carriers is ill defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on the natural history of these diseases, therefore, are essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The family tree mortality ratio method offers the unique possibility to study the natural history at a time when the disease was not known and patients received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 6 inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes caused by specific mutations, we analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality with the family tree mortality ratio method (main outcome measure, standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) type 1, severely increased mortality risk during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> years of childhood was observed (1-19 years), in particular during the first 10 years of life (SMR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In LQTS type 2, we observed increasing SMRs starting from age 15 years, which just reached significance between age 30 and 39 (SMR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.1-10.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In LQTS type 3, the SMR was increased between age 15 and 19 years (SMR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.2-16.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the SCN5A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">overlap syndrome</z:e>, excess mortality was observed between age 10 and 59 years, with a peak between 20 and 39 years (SMR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.5-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, excess mortality was restricted to ages 20 to 39 years (SMR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, excess mortality was observed between age 40 and 59 (SMR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4), particularly in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified age ranges during which the mortality risk manifests in an unselected and untreated population, which can guide screening in these families </plain></SENT>
