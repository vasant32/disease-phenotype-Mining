<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the occurrence of bubble formation seen on intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and the microembolic signals (MESs) detected by transcranial Doppler on the use of different ablation techniques and anticoagulation strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -This prospective study included 35 procedures in 34 consecutive patients (age: 52, SD: 12.8 years; female:male 9:25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PVI was performed with a cryoballoon and the conventional anticoagulation protocol (ACT&gt;250 s) in 10 procedures (Group 1), with a multipolar duty-cycled radiofrequency pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) and the conventional anticoagulation protocol in 12 procedures (Group 2), and with a PVAC with an aggressive anticoagulation regime (ACT&gt;320 s) in 13 procedures (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean total numbers of MESs detected during the procedures were 833.7 (SD: 727.4) in Group 1, 3142.6 (SD: 1736.4) in Group 2 and 2204.6 (SD: 1078.1) in Group 3 (p=0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MESs were detected mostly during energy delivery in the PVAC groups, while a relatively even distribution of emboli formation was seen during cryoballoon ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups between the degree of bubble formation on ICE and the number of MESs (p=0.0000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Duty-cycled RF ablation is associated with significantly more MESs, even when more aggressive anticoagulation is applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With both techniques most of these microemboli are gaseous in nature </plain></SENT>
