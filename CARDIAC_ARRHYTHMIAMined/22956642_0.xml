<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search of PubMed-Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to November 2010 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our search was restricted to cohort or case-control studies in adults diagnosed with OSA by screening questionnaire, oximetry, or polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies without controls, involving upper airway surgery, and with OSA diagnosed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes alone were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary postoperative outcomes were desaturation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (ARF), reintubation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the final analysis (n=3942) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OSA was associated with significantly higher odds of any postoperative cardiac events [45/1195 (3.76%) vs 24/1420 (1.69%); odds ratio (OR) 2.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.50, P=0.007] and ARF [33/1680 (1.96%) vs 24/3421 (0.70%); OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.34-4.39, P=0.003] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects were not <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> for these outcomes (I(2)=0-15%, P&gt;0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OSA was also significantly associated with higher odds of desaturation [189/1764 (10.71%) vs 105/1881 (5.58%); OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.26, P=0.01] and ICU transfer [105/2062 (5.09%) vs 58/3681 (1.57%), respectively; OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.46-5.43, P=0.002] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both outcomes showed a significant degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the effect among studies (I(2)=57-68%, P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses had similar conclusions as main analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative desaturation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, postoperative cardiac events, and ICU transfers was higher in patients with OSA </plain></SENT>
