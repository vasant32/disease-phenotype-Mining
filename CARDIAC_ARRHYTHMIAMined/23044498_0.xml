<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 6% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> ethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> solution with 4% gelatin and Ringer's solutions on the haemodynamic stability of patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and immediately after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial of 92 patients who were candidates for on-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of CPB, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and divided randomly into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group received Ringer's solution, the second group 4% gelatin, and the third 6% <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> ethyl <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> (HES) solution (Voluven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume needed for maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure and central venous pressure in the range of 10-14 mmHg was less in the HES group than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume was similar however in the gelatin and Ringer's groups in the first 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Urinary output in the first four and 24 hours after surgery were significantly higher in the HES group than in the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in the HES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HES (6%) had a better volume-expanding effect than gelatin (4%) and Ringer's solutions, and its short-term effects on renal function were also better than gelatin and Ringer's solutions </plain></SENT>
