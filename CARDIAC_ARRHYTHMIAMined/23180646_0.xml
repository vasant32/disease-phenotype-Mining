<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lead extraction of chronically implanted leads is a highly specialized procedure and the Heart Rhythm Society published a consensus document outlining best practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to ascertain the current practice and perception of lead extraction in the UK.METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective e-mail survey consisting of 21 questions was sent to members of Heart Rhythm UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Key areas for exploration included case volume, settings for extraction procedures, levels of surgical support, preferred techniques, and the perceptions of difficulty, risk, morbidity, and mortality associated with lead extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty responses were received giving a response rate of 9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three per cent of responders performed extractions regularly and of these 92% were electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median number of cases performed per year was 13 (interquartile range 6-26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six per cent performed &lt;20 procedures per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty per cent of procedures were performed in the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory and of these 50% had no identifiable surgeon or operating theatre on standby </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mechanical dissection sheaths were the most widely used method of extraction after failure of manual traction (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of minor complications was perceived to be 4% or less by the majority of respondents across the device range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same measure for major complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 2 and 1%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Increased operator caseload and closer links between EP extractors and surgeons should be seen as achievable goals </plain></SENT>
