<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate is high in psychiatric patients versus general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important cause of this increased mortality is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) as a major side-effect of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These SCDs generally result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring when the posology is high and may attain a toxic threshold but also at dosages within therapeutic range, in the presence of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are three kinds of risk factors: physiological (e.g., low cardiac rate of sportsmen), physiopathological (e.g., hepatic insufficiency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>) and "therapeutic" (due to interactions between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> and other medicines) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Association of pharmacological agents may increase the likelihood of SCDs either by (i) a pharmacokinetic mechanism (e.g., increased torsadogenic potential of a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drug</z:chebi> when its destruction and/or elimination are compromised) or (ii) a pharmacodynamical mechanism (e.g., mutual potentiation of proarrhythmic properties of two drugs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, some <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in cases of pre-existing congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathies</z:e> such as (i) congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> that eventually cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(ii) A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, that may directly cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> due to reduced <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current through Nav1.5 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> may be a direct cause of cardiac lesions also leading to SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the case, for example, of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> responsible for ischemic coronaropathies and of <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> that is involved in the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The aims of this work are to delineate: (i) the risk of SCD related to the use of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi>; (ii) mechanisms involved in the occurrence of such SCD; (iii) preventive actions of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> side effects, on the basis of the knowledge of patient-specific risk factors, documented from clinical history, ionic balance, and ECG investigation by the psychiatrist </plain></SENT>
