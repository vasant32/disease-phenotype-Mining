<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is caused by mutations in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor gene (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that RyR2 mutations respond to sympathetic activation with an abnormal diastolic Ca(2+) leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum; however the pathways that mediate the response to adrenergic stimulation have not been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our RyR2(R4496C+/-) knock-in mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) counteracts the effects of adrenergic stimulation resulting in an antiarrhythmic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition with KN-93 completely prevented <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice, while the inactive congener KN-92 had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ventricular myocytes isolated from the hearts of RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice, CaMKII inhibition with an autocamtide-2 related inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> or with KN-93 blunted triggered activity and transient inward currents induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> also enhanced the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), increased spontaneous Ca(2+) release and spark frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition blunted each of these parameters without having an effect on the SR Ca(2+) content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data therefore indicate that CaMKII inhibition is an effective intervention to prevent arrhythmogenesis (both in vivo and in vitro) in the RyR2(R4496C+/-) knock-in mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, CAMKII inhibition acts on several elements of the EC coupling cascade, including an attenuation of SR Ca(2+) leak and blunting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-mediated SERCA activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition may therefore represent a novel therapeutic target for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
