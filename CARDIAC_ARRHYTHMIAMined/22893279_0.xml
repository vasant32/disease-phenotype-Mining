<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the impact of comprehensive treatment, including hemodynamic interventions such as surgery, catheter-based intervention and pacemaker implantation (PMI), on tachyarrhythmia in repaired TOF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 66 repaired TOF patients with tachyarrhythmia (age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 23Â±11 years), 29 patients had sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, 21 had sustained or non-sustained VT, and 16 had both (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>+VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment with catheter-directed ablation and/or anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) alone was achieved in 31 (69%) and partially achieved in 6 (13%) of 45 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery, catheter-based intervention, and/or PMI were performed in 21 (32%) of 66 patients and resulted in complete control of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 8 (38%) and partial control in 7 (33%) of these 21 patients, 20 (95%) of whom were receiving AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with successfully controlled tachyarrhythmia in response to catheter ablation and/or AADs without hemodynamic intervention had a significantly higher probability of absence of sinus node dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 23.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-845.2; P=0.02) and lone intra-atrial reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (OR, 12.4; 95% CI: 1.3-278.7; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic interventions resulted in an improvement in outcomes in repaired TOF patients with tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To effectively manage intractable tachyarrhythmia with hemodynamic abnormalities, it is essential to understand hemodynamics and consider hemodynamic intervention </plain></SENT>
