<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism that leads to the development of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is still uncertain, though increasing evidence suggests that it is mainly due to autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> sympathetic predominance and parasympathetic withdrawal during the first 72h are associated with the occurrence of severe secondary complications in the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right insular cortex lesions are also related with sympathetic overactivation and with a higher incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities, mostly QT prolongation, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, female sex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> are independent risk factors for severe prolongation of the QT interval which subsequently results in malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of repolarization changes commonly seen after aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, such as ST segment, T wave, and U wave abnormalities, still remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with traumatic brain injury both intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> correlate with low heart rate variability and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given that there are no firm guidelines for the prevention or treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that appear after cerebral incidents this review aims to highlight important issues on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selected patients with the aforementioned risk factors could benefit from electrocardiographic monitoring, reassessment of the medications that prolong QTc interval, and administration of antiadrenergic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is required in order to validate these assumptions and to establish specific therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
