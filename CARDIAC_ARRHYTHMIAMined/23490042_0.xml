<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, it has become possible to record, from a large number of extracellular electrodes, the electrical activities of smooth muscle organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These recordings, after proper processing and analysis, may reveal origin and propagation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal electrical activities in these organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several publications have appeared in the past 5 years describing origin and propagation of slow waves in the stomach of experimental animals and in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, publications are now starting to appear that describe pathophysiological patterns of propagation and these studies provide us with novel concepts regarding potential mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the gut, crucial information if we are ever going to successfully treat patients suffering from such <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this issue of Neurogastroenterology &amp; Motility, Angeli et al. have mapped the slow wave propagation in the porcine small intestine and discovered two types of reentry; functional reentry and circumferential reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next to the descriptions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the stomach, the fact that reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> may also occur in the small intestine further extends this new emerging field of gastrointestinal (GI) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this viewpoint, the relevance of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is further discussed and a few ideas for future research in this field, not necessarily constrained to the GI system, proposed </plain></SENT>
