<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether patients with an elevated left ventricular mass index undergoing cardiac surgery were more likely to experience postoperative atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A single tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One thousand consecutive patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of adult cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: With institutional review board approval, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic images were reviewed by a single reviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular mass index was calculated using the American Society of Echocardiography-recommended formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medical charts were reviewed for the occurrence and type of clinically significant postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the patients who had an elevated left ventricular mass index, 47.6% (225/473) developed clinically significant postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared with 38.3% (142/371) of patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.93; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, this finding remained statistically significant, controlling for the effects of age, weight, sex, surgery type, left ventricular function, functional status, left atrial dimensions, and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90 per 100-g/m(2) increase in the left ventricular mass index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increased left ventricular mass index was also an independent predictor of the separate or combined occurrence of atrial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An elevated left ventricular mass index was a strong independent predictor of clinically significant postoperative atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> after adult cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although prospective validation is required, targeting patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prophylaxis therapy may be justified in patients with a left ventricular mass index &gt;188 g/m(2) </plain></SENT>
