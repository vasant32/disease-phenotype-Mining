<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) have been recalled due to increased risk of insulation failure leading to externalized cables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As this mechanical failure does not necessarily correlate with electrical failure, it can be difficult to diagnose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopic screening can identify insulation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies have suggested that insulation failure is predominantly seen in 8-Fr, single-coil models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patients have exclusively dual-coil leads and a high proportion of 7-Fr leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fluoroscopic screening was performed in 48 patients with recalled Riata leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had 8-Fr Riata leads and 25 patients had 7-Fr Riata ST leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Images were recorded in at least three projections and studies were reviewed by seven attending electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Externalized cables were seen in ten patients (21 %), and another five patients (10 %) had abnormal cable spacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> device interrogations showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal leads had more leads in situ (2.5 ± 0.7 vs. 1.6 ± 0.8 leads; P = 0.002) and a higher rate of nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (80 vs. 24 %; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the groups with regards to patient age, body mass index, lead age, lead parameters, or vascular access site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no difference with regard to lead size (P = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Riata family of leads has a high incidence of mechanical failure, as demonstrated on fluoroscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this study, the 7-Fr models were just as likely to mechanically fail as the 8-Fr models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Increasing lead burden and a diagnosis of nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> correlated with insulation failure </plain></SENT>
