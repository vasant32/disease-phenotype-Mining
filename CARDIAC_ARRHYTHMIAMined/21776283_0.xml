<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct implantation of isolated myoblasts, cardiomyocytes, and bone-marrow-derived cells has shown prospect for improved cardiac performance in several animal models and patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, direct implantation of cultured cells can lead to major cell loss by leakage and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, inappropriate integration and proliferation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To resolve these problems an approach using 3-dimensional tissue-engineered cell constructs has been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell engineering technology has enabled scaffold-free sheet development including generation of communication between cell graft and host tissue, creation of organized microvascular network, and relatively long-term survival after in vivo transplantation </plain></SENT>
