<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of 9 piperazine derivatives of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37647">xanthone</z:chebi> were synthesized and evaluated for cardiovascular activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following pharmacological experiments were conducted: the binding affinity for adrenoceptors, the influence on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electrocardiogram, the effect on the arterial blood pressure and prophylactic antiarrhythmic activity in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> induced model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (rats, iv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three compounds revealed nanomolar affinity for Î±(1)-adrenoceptor which was correlated with the strongest cardiovascular (antiarrhythmic and hypotensive) activity in animals' models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most promising compound was 4-(3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi>-1-yl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46881">propoxy</z:chebi>)-9H-xanthen-9-one <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (12) which revealed antiarrhythmic activity with ED(50) value of 0.69 mg/kg in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (rats, iv) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other synthesized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37647">xanthone</z:chebi> derivatives, that is, (R,S)-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi>-1-yl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46881">propoxy</z:chebi>)-9H-xanthen-9-one <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (10) and (R,S)-4-(2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28568">piperazine</z:chebi>-1-yl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46881">propoxy</z:chebi>)-9H-xanthen-9-one <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (11) also acted as potential antiarrhythmics in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> induced model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in rats after intravenous injection (ED(50) = 0.88 mg/kg and 0.89 mg/kg, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values were lower than values obtained for reference drugs such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and urapidil, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were quite promising and suggested that in the group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37647">xanthone</z:chebi> derivatives new potential antiarrhythmics and hypotensives might be found </plain></SENT>
