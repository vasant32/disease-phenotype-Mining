<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to compare the electrocardiographic findings in adult sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> patients with CAN with those of patients without this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross sectional study was done using 62 consecutively recruited sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> was determined based on abnormal values in at least two of five non-invasive tests: Valsalva manoeuver, heart rate variation during deep breathing, heart rate response to standing, blood pressure response to sustained hand grip, and blood pressure response to standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were subsequently evaluated with electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> patients with CAN had statistically significantly increased P-wave duration (p &lt; 0.001), PR-interval (p &lt; 0.05) and QTc dispersion (p &lt; 0.05) compared with patients without CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased frequencies of Q waves and first degree atrio-ventricular block were found in patients with CAN than in those without CAN (p = 0.026, p = 0.014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were noted between the severity of CAN [number of abnormal autonomic function tests (AFT)] and (1) P-wave duration (p = 0.008), (2) PR- interval (p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant association was found between the number of abnormal AFT and (1) presence of Q-waves, and (2) degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (haematocrit class) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic features consistent with atrio-ventricular and ventricular repolarization abnormalities are associated with CAN in sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate the prognostic implications of these findings in sickle cell patients with cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
