<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation with fish oils can reverse atrial mechanical stunning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing reversion of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) to sinus rhythm were randomized to a control group (n = 26) or an omega-3 group (n = 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter were prescribed 6 g/day of fish oil for â‰¥1 month prior to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters of left atrial appendage function were compared immediately before and immediately after reversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After fish oil intake for a mean of 70 days, the following were noted favoring the omega-3 group among both AF and AFL patients: (1) 2-fold higher serum omega-3 levels (P &lt; .001), (2) less mean decrease in emptying velocity (e.g., AF: 8% vs. 32%, P = .02), (3) less mean decrease in appendage emptying fraction (e.g., AFL: 7% vs. 60%, P = .002), (4) lower incidence of new or increased spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (e.g., AF: 11% vs. 62.5%, P = .003), and (5) lower incidence of atrial mechanical stunning (e.g., AFL: 20% vs. 100%, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Omega-3 intake conferred protection against stunning in a multivariable analysis (odds ratio 0.18, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> fish oil ingestion in humans attenuates atrial mechanical stunning after reversion of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that fish oils may target or even reverse underlying cellular and/or structural remodeling that occurs in response to persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
