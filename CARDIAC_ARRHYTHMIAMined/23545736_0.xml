<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In failing hearts, abnormalities of neurohormonal mechanisms, which were included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> activation of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or of the renin-angiotensin system result in structural and functional changes in the calcium (Ca(2 +) ) regulatory proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes include the decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) load, which could be caused by reduced SR Ca(2 +) -ATPase (SERCA2A) function and increased SR Ca(2 +) leak via cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) , a functional defect in L-type Ca(2 +) channel and activation of the reversal mode of Na (+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abnormal regulation of intracellular Ca(2 +) affects troponin C binding and actin-myosin cross bridging and modulates post signaling pathway, which in turn contributes to the contractile dysfunction of hearts and hence to the progression of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, diastolic Ca(2 +) leak may develop delayed after depolarization and triggered activity as a substrate for lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we focus on the underlying mechanism of defective Ca(2 +) regulation in HF and on the possibility of proceeding to clinical application as a new treatment for HF by targeting Ca(2 +) regulatory proteins </plain></SENT>
