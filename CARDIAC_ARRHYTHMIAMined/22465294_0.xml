<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Islets of myocytes within fibrofatty scars represent the substrate for reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomic mapping can reliably identify such areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively test the association between late and fragmented electrograms within scar and arrhythmic events in patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-density right ventricle electroanatomic mapping was performed in 32 patients with ARVC without history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard definitions of electroanatomic scars and fragmented, isolated, and very late potentials were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for the primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 25 ± 7 months, 12 (38%) patients received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock for sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a higher rate of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (P = .053), patients with arrhythmic events at follow-up did not differ from those who remained free from arrhythmic events in terms of other clinical variables, including cardiac magnetic resonance findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomic scars were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The distribution and extent of electroanatomic scars were similar in the 2 groups (38 ± 25 cm(2) vs 33 ± 20 cm(2); P = .51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock had a higher prevalence of fragmented electrograms (92% vs 20%; P &lt;.001), of isolated late potentials (75% vs 20%; P = .004), and of very late potentials (67% vs 25%; P = .030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fragmented electrograms were the only variable independently associated with arrhythmic events at follow-up (hazard ratio 21; P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of fragmented and delayed electrograms within the scar predicts arrhythmic events in ARVC </plain></SENT>
