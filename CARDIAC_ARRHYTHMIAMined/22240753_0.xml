<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF has a slightly lower incidence and prevalence in Asian populations than in Western populations, but the associated relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality is similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF in Asia have similar disease profiles and CHADS2 score distributions compared to those in the West, with the exception of a slightly higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart diseases</z:hpo> in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ventricular rate control should be the initial consideration in patients with AF and rapid ventricular rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-arrhythmic drugs have only a modest long-term effect on maintenance of sinus rhythm, and clinical trials in both the West and the East show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> rhythm control is not superior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> rate control in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, most likely because the benefit of anti-arrhythmic drugs in these trials was often offset by proarrhythmic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECG-driven trials for AF should be replaced by outcome-driven ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATHENA is the largest outcome trial to confirm the superiority of a new anti-arrhythmic drug in improving cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The choice of anti-arrhythmic drugs for AF should be based on both safety and efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For long-term rate control, a lenient strategy with a ventricular rate of less than 110bpm may be adequate, but more strict rate control may be required if patients continue to complain of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation should be reserved for patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
