<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visceral involvement, including cardiac manifestations, can lead to severe clinical complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional echocardiography parameters have limited sensitivity to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction in patients with SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess, using novel speckle-tracking strain analysis, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with SSc, and to investigate its relationship to functional capacity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 104 patients with SSc (mean ± SD age 54 ± 12 years, 77% female) were included and underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 24-hour electrocardiography (EKG) Holter monitoring, and transthoracic echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 37 matched healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total patient population consisted of 51 patients with limited cutaneous SSc and 53 with diffuse cutaneous SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak VO(2) was a mean ± SD 91 ± 20% predicted, and 28 patients had abnormal findings (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or ventricular ectopics &gt;100/day) on EKG Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with SSc, as compared with controls, had impaired global longitudinal and circumferential strains (mean ± SD -18.2 ± 1.8% versus -21.3 ± 1.7% and -18.2 ± 2.3% versus -21.3 ± 2.1%, respectively; each P &lt; 0.01), but there was no difference in the left ventricular ejection fraction between patients and controls (mean ± SD 63.5 ± 7.2% versus 64.6 ± 4.4%; P = 0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with SSc, global longitudinal and circumferential strains each correlated with the peak VO(2) (r = -0.46 and r = -0.41, respectively; both P &lt; 0.01), and multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association of each strain measure with the peak VO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to SSc patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results on EKG Holter monitoring, SSc patients with abnormal results showed impaired global longitudinal strains (-18.5 ± 1.5% versus -17.1 ± 2.1%; P &lt; 0.01) and circumferential strains (-18.7 ± 2.0% versus -17.3 ± 2.5%; P = 0.01), and each strain measure was independently associated with abnormal Holter findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Speckle-tracking strain analysis can detect subtle myocardial dysfunction in patients with SSc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Importantly, decreased global longitudinal and circumferential strains are associated with lower functional capacity and rhythm disturbances in patients with SSc </plain></SENT>
