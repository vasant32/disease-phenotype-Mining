<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this EP Wire is to survey clinical practice in this rapidly evolving field as the variety of surgical techniques and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of treated patients make the comparison of results and outcomes challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four European centres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the EHRA EP research network, responded to this survey and completed the questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the participating centres, 11 (46%) performed (irrespective of the technique) stand-alone surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven hospitals (64%) performed totally thoracoscopic AF ablation procedures off-pump (in 20-100% of their cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used lesion set was only pulmonary vein isolation in five hospitals (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight centres (73%) performed validation of the surgical lesion set at the time of intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most important indication for performing stand-alone, totally thoracoscopic surgical AF ablation in seven participating hospitals was failed catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to their definition of success, participating centres reported their success rate to be 10-100% for paroxysmal AF and 0-95% for (longstanding) persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered complications during stand-alone, surgical AF ablation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and haemothorax in up to 10% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This EP Wire survey shows a wide variation not only in indications for stand-alone, surgical AF ablation, but also in surgical techniques, lesion sets, follow-up, and outcome </plain></SENT>
