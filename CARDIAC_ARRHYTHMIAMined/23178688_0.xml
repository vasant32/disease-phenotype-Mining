<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A recent clinical study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> reported that autoantibodies to β-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) could act as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> to induce atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that activating autoantibodies to the β2AR in the rabbit atrium are arrhythmogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with a β2AR second extracellular loop <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> to raise β2AR antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A catheter-based electrophysiologic study was performed on anesthetized rabbits before and after immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence was determined in response to burst pacing before and after the infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> in incremental concentrations of 10 μM, 100 μM, and 1 mM at 1 mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the preimmune studies when β2AR antibody titers were undetectable, of a total of 20 events, only 3 episodes of nonsustained (&lt;10 seconds) atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the postimmune studies when β2AR antibody titers ranged from 1:160,000 to 1:1.28 million, burst pacing induced 10 episodes of nonsustained or sustained (≥10 seconds) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 20 events (P = .04 vs preimmune; χ(2) and Fisher exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taking into account only the sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, there were 6 episodes in 20 events in the postimmune studies compared with 0 episodes in 20 events in the preimmune studies (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunized rabbits demonstrated immunoglobulin G deposition in the atria, and their sera induced significant activation of β2AR in transfected cells in vitro compared to the preimmune sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced autoantibody activation of β2AR in the rabbit atrium leads to atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> mainly in the form of sustained atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
