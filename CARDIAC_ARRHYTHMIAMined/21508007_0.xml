<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Techniques to confirm roof line block may be time consuming and challenging and have not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether local activation times (LAT) during left atrial appendage (LAA) pacing help in the assessment of roof line block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five patients underwent ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) including circumferential pulmonary vein isolation, roof, and mitral isthmus lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local activation times were measured at pre-defined points on the posterior wall and high anterior wall during LAA pacing at the following stages: (i) baseline; (ii) incomplete roof line; (iii) roof block; and (iv) roof and mitral isthmus block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time from pacing at high posterior wall to LAA was also recorded at each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operator curve analyses were performed on different parameters to assess if they could confirm roof line block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a stepwise increase in mean high posterior wall LAT: 83 ± 16 ms (baseline); 105 ± 20 ms (incomplete roof block); 133 ± 26 ms (roof block), and 152 ± 35 ms (roof and MI block; one way analysis of variance, P&lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased LA diameter, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> use, and adjunctive complex fractionated atrial electrogram ablation were associated with longer LATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For patients with persistent AF, LAA to high posterior wall times of &gt;133 ms, high posterior wall to LAA times of &gt;125 ms and double potential &gt;77 ms predict roof line block with high specificity and sensitivity especially if there was also mitral isthmus block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Parameters derived from the measurement of LAT of the high posterior and anterior LA wall help guide the assessment of roof line block </plain></SENT>
