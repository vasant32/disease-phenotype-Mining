<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children's baseline RSA was assessed in the laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sleep was monitored for seven consecutive nights at the child's home via actigraphy and the following sleep parameters were derived: sleep minutes, sleep activity index and sleep efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses showed that after controlling for potential confounds, higher RSA was a predictor of lower sleep activity and higher sleep efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results highlight the importance of physiological regulation for the sleep of healthy preschool children </plain></SENT>
