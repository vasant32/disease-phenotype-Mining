<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that an aerosolized β₂-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi>, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury (ALI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 282 patients with ALI receiving mechanical ventilation were randomized to receive aerosolized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> (5 mg) or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome variable for the trial was ventilator-free days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ventilator-free days were not significantly different between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> and placebo groups (means of 14.4 and 16.6 d, respectively; 95% confidence interval for the difference, -4.7 to 0.3 d; P = 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before hospital discharge were not significantly different between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> and placebo groups (23.0 and 17.7%, respectively; 95%confidence interval for the difference,-4.0 to 14.7%;P = 0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients with shock before randomization, the number of ventilator-free days was lower with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi>, although mortality was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, heart rates were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> group by approximately 4 beats/minute in the first 2 days after randomization, but rates of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (10% in both groups) and other cardiac dysrhythmias were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that aerosolized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with ALI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Routine use of β₂-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ALI cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00434993) </plain></SENT>
