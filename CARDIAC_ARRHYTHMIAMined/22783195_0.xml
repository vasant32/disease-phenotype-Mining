<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this phenomenon has been identified as a potential precursor to dangerous reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, significant uncertainty remains regarding its mechanism and no clinically practical means of halting its occurrence or progression currently exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac alternans has well-characterized tissue, cellular, and subcellular manifestations, the mechanisms and interplay of which are an active area of research </plain></SENT>
