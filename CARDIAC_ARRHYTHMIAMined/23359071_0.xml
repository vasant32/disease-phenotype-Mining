<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) maintain the cellular reducing environment by scavenging intracellular <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been recently noted that physical exercise has a positive effect on the PRX system, exerting a protective effect against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, other compounds, such as sestrins (SESNs), a stress-inducible protein family with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties, should also be considered in the function of PRXs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SESNs are clearly involved in the regeneration process of PRXs and therefore may also be modulated by physical exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, SESNs are clearly involved in TOR, AMPK, p53, FoxO, and PRXs signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aforementioned pathways are implicated in aging processes by inducing an increased resistance to subsequent stress, thus delaying age-related changes, such as sarcopenia and frailty, and consequently promoting longevity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, exercise also modulates these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, exercise is one of the most important recommended strategies to prevent sarcopenia and frailty, increase longevity, and improve health in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Loss of SESNs can cause several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pathologies, such as fat accumulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0000749'>muscle degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, physical inactivity leads to accumulation of visceral fat and consequently the activation of a network of inflammatory pathways, which promote development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To date, the SESNs-exercise relationship has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this emerging family of stress proteins may be part of the redox-based adaptive response to exercise </plain></SENT>
