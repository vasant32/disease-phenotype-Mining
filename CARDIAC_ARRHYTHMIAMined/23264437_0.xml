<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The pivot is critical to rotors postulated to maintain <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that wavefronts <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp> the pivot should broaden the amplitude distribution of bipolar electrograms because of directional information encoded in these signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether Shannon entropy (ShEn), a measure of signal amplitude distribution, could differentiate the pivot from surrounding peripheral regions and thereby assist clinical rotor mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Bipolar electrogram recordings were studied in 4 systems: (1) computer simulations of rotors in a 2-dimensional atrial sheet; (2) isolated rat atria recorded with a multi-electrode array (n=12); (3) epicardial plaque recordings of induced AF in hypertensive sheep (n=11); and (4) persistent AF patients (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the model systems, rotation episodes were identified, and ShEn calculated as an index of amplitude distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In humans, ShEn distribution was analyzed at AF termination sites and with respect to complex fractionated electrogram mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed rotation episodes in simulations (4 cycles) and animals (rats: 14 rotors, duration 80±81 cycles; sheep: 13 rotors, 4.2±1.5 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximum ShEn bipole was consistently colocated with the pivot zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ShEn was negatively associated with distance from the pivot zone in simulated spiral waves, rats, and sheep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ShEn was modestly inversely associated with complex fractionated electrogram; however, there was no relationship at the sites of highest ShEn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ShEn is a mechanistically based tool that may assist AF rotor mapping </plain></SENT>
