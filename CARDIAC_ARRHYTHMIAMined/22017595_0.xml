<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> has been extensively studied, little is known about predictors of response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify clinical parameters associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> success in a large cohort of patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/RESULTS: A total of 287 patients with AF started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> between 2001 and 2008 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> was deemed "completely effective" if the patient remained on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> at follow-up and had no recurrences of AF clinically or by electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> efficacy was analyzed in relation to clinical variables relevant to AF and AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 10.2 Â± 7.7 months, 54.7% of the patients remained on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> and it was completely effective in 26.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discontinuation rate during initial hospitalization was 13.3% from excessive QT prolongation and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (successfully treated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A history of CAD was the only univariate predictor of efficacy (odds ratio [OR] 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.01, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAD remained the only significant factor associated with efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> in a multivariate regression model (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.11-3.70, P &lt; 0.05, n = 270) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> in patients with CAD was 41.1%, compared to 23.5% in those without CAD (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients with AF, underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> was significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding may have utility for clinical decisions regarding initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
