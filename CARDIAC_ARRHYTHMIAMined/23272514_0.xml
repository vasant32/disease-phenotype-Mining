<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Often, this condition may be accentuated by medication (digitalis, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, antiarrhythmics), so that they become more sensitive to electrolyte disturbances, reacting sometimes violently with severe and life threatening rhythm troubles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: the evaluation of the incidence of electrolyte disturbances in patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in order to establish a correlation with the evolution, prognosis and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 100 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> NYHA II-IV classes, admitted in Cardiology Clinic during 2009-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed electrolytic disturbances occurred during different strategies of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were admitted in Cardiology Clinic during 2009-2011, 75 males and 25 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was established by classical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation was very complex and included: complete clinical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, chest ray examination and biochemical analyses especially hepatic, renal function and electrolyte status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data showed that electrolyte disturbances are frequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, irrespectively of NYHA class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hyperkalaemia, hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia are associated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> therapy and may play a very important role in subsequent development of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
