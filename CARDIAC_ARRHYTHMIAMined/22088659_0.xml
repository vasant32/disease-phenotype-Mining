<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety of outpatient endovascular treatment in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrospinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> (CCSVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to assess complications occurring within 30 days of endovascular treatment of CCSVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 240 patients; 257 procedures were performed over 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The indication for treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was symptomatic MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the procedures, 49.0% (126 of 257) were performed in a hospital, and 51.0% (131 of 257) were performed in the office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary procedures accounted for 93.0% (239 of 257) of procedures, and repeat interventions accounted for 7% (18 of 257) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients treated primarily, 87% (208 of 239) had angioplasty, and 11% (26 of 239) had stent placement; 5 patients were not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of patients with restenosis, 50% (9 of 18) had angioplasty, and 50% (9 of 18) had stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three patients were discharged within 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> after the procedure was reported in 8.2% (21 of 257) of patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> persisted &gt; 30 days in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neck pain was reported in 15.6% (40 of 257); 52.5% (21 of 40) of these patients underwent stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> requiring retreatment within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sustained intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in three patients, and two required hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of these patients, who was being retreated for stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, was hospitalized because of a stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of CCSVI is a safe procedure; there is a 1.6% risk of major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cardiac monitoring is essential to detect intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography after the procedure is recommended to confirm venous patency and to identify patients experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
