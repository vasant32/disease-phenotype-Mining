<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate left atrial (LA) mechanical functions, atrial electromechanical coupling and P wave dispersion in patients with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty patients with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> and forty controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> were reached with increased or decreased serum TSH and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> free T4 (fT4) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA volumes were measured using the biplane area length method and LA active and passive emptying volumes and fraction were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interatrial electromechanical delay were measured by tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups had similar demographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA mechanical functions significantly impaired in subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intra- and Interatrial delay, were measured significantly higher in patients with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PA lateral and interatrial delay were positively correlated with TSH (r = 0.507, p = 0.006 and r = 0.455, p = 0.015, respectively) in subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothyroid</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was negative correlation between TSH and interatrial delay (r = -0.492, p = 0.006) in subclinical hyperthyroid patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Linear multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that, TSH was the only an independent factor of interatrial delay in patients with subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that impaired LA mechanical and electromechanical function in subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128,C0162044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TSH was an independent determinant of interatrial delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prolonged atrial electromechanical coupling time and impaired mechanical atrial functions may be related to the increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
