<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This review focuses on developments after 2008, when the topic was last reviewed by the author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pertinent publications were found by medline searches and in the author's personal data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was investigated in a number of trials, sparked by one positive report on the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA), considerations of upstream therapy, data from electrophysiologic laboratories and animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA prevent postoperative AF, the effect is probably smaller than initially expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same is probably true for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and for new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Larger trials are currently ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was studied in carriers of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, with no clear results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This might have been due to a broad definition of the primary endpoint, including any <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and any action of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies support the contention that high levels of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, since SCD is a rare occurrence, it is difficult to conduct an adequately powered trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA reduced total mortality and rehospitalizations, but not SCD or presumed arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of three trials in patients after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, two were inadequately powered, and in one, the dose might have been too low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, while epidemiologic studies support an inverse relation between <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA and occurrence of SCD or arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, demonstrating this effect in intervention trials remained elusive so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A pro-arrhythmic effect of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA has not been seen in intervention studies, and results of epidemiologic and animal studies also rather argue against such an effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A different, and probably more productive, perspective is provided by a standardized analytical assessment of a person's status in <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA by use of the omega-3 index, <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA in red cell fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In populations with a high omega-3 index, SCD is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Intervention trials can become more effective by including a low omega-3 index into the inclusion criteria, thus creating a study population more likely to demonstrate an effect of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> + DHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This is especially relevant in case of rare endpoints, like new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF or SCD </plain></SENT>
