<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application enlargement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethynylestradiol</z:chebi> in clinics and abuse in livestock farming and fishing make it important to explore <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethynylestradiol</z:chebi> toxicological action on vertebrate embryonic development and to establish an in vivo method for EE toxicity detection efficiently and conveniently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using a model animal zebrafish and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">17alpha-ethynylestradiol</z:chebi> as a representative compound, we have investigated EE2 teratogenicity, target tissues and target genes on zebrafish embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that median teratogenesis concentration (TC50) of EE2 is 0.8 microg x mL(-1), and median lethal dose (LD50) is 3.3 microg x mL(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Targets of EE2 action were implicated in brain, eyes, heart, muscle, skeleton, pigment and viscera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embryonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> caused by EE2 is probably resulted from heart abnormal structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The embryonic stage sensitive to EE2 mainly started at cleavage and last up to the organogenesis with time-accumulating effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR results indicate that EE2 treatment disturbed gene expression pattern at the early period of zebrafish embryonic development by suppressing transcription of gene boz that promotes brain development, upregulating genes for trunk and tail, such as ntl, spt, shh, and perturbing Nodal signal expression of TGFbeta superfamily, for example, cyc, sqt and oep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using zebrafish, an efficient in vivo method for quick evaluation of EE toxicity on embryonic development has been developed </plain></SENT>
