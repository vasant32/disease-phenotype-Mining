<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most electrical equipment in the modern operating room (OR) radiates electrical noise (EN) that can interfere with patient monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have described the EN that an intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) system emits and have shown that this high-energy EN diminishes the quality of the ECG waveform during iMRI scans in our neurosurgical OR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that the ECG signal filters in our iMRI-compatible patient monitor reduce this interference but, in the process, disturb the true <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the displayed waveform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This simulation study evaluates how iMRI-generated EN affects the ability of the anesthetist to detect and identify ECG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and whether the patient monitor's ECG signal filters can improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using an ECG simulator, we generated Lead II and V5 ECG signal segments that contained either no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or one of four common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We filtered the ECG segments with four filters available on our iMRI-compatible monitor (Veris <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, MEDRAD Inc., Indianola, PA USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then digitized the segments and mixed simulated iMRI EN into the resultant tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With institutional approval and written informed consent, board-certified anesthesiologists reviewed the tracings, determined if an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was present and identified the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conducted the study anonymously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We reported the data as percent correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection and correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one anesthesiologists completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the participants correctly detected 79.5% (95% CI: 77.2, 81.7%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and correctly identified 62.5% (95% CI: 59.8, 65.3%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, regardless of EN presence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the proportions among monitor noise filters studied were not significant, the manufacturer-designated MR5 Veris <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> filter optimized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> identification for our participants, regardless if EN was present in the ECG tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the neurosurgical OR, the anesthetist must be able to effectively monitor a patient in the presence of iMRI-generated EN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Depending on the OR design, the patient may be out of the anesthetist's direct view during a scan procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The anesthetist must rely on monitored physiologic parameters to assess patient status during this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>He/she should be familiar with his/her monitor's filtering capabilities and routinely adjust the ECG filters to achieve the best compromise between minimized EN effects and maximized displayed ECG signal quality </plain></SENT>
