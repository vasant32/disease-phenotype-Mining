<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current trial was to assess the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy withdrawal on the measures of cardiac repolarization in patients with OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one OSA patients established on CPAP treatment were randomized to either CPAP withdrawal (subtherapeutic CPAP) or continue therapeutic CPAP for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polysomnography was performed, and indices of cardiac repolarization (QT(c), TpTe(c) intervals) and dispersion of repolarization (TpTe/QT ratio) were derived from 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) at baseline and 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuous positive airway pressure withdrawal led to a recurrence of OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with therapeutic CPAP, subtherapeutic CPAP for 2 weeks was associated with a significant increase in the length of the QT(c) and TpTe(c) intervals (mean difference between groups 21.4 ms, 95% CI 11.3-1.6 ms, P &lt; 0.001 and 14.4 ms, 95% CI 7.2-21.5 ms, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) and in the TpTe/QT ratio (mean difference between groups 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.03, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant correlation between the change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo>/hypopnoea index (AHI) from baseline, and both the change in the QT(c) interval and the TpTe(c) interval (r = 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-0.77, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.45, 95% CI 0.17-0.67, P = 0.003, n = 41, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous positive airway pressure withdrawal is associated with the prolongation of the QT(c) and TpTe(c) intervals and TpTe/QT ratio, which may provide a possible mechanistic link between OSA, cardiac dysrhythmias, and thus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
