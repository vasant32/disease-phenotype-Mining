<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current ion channel blockade therapies and catheter ablation have significant limitations in treatment of AF, mainly because they do not address the underlying pathophysiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> has been implicated as a major underlying pathology that promotes AF; however, conventional <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> have not shown impressive therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A more careful design of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapies and better selection of patients likely are required to treat effectively AF with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current evidence suggest inhibition of prominent cardiac sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase and targeting subcellular compartments with the highest levels of ROS may prove to be effective therapies for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased serum markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be an important guide in selecting the AF patients who will most likely respond to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
