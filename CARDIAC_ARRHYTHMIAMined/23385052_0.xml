<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to define CRT-related benefits in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement in two subgroups of patients (&lt;75 and ≥75 years old) and test possible differences between these two groups.METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-centre prospective observational study including 65 patients with optimally treated, advanced HF and indication to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were investigated with clinical evaluation, Minnesota Living with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Questionnaire (MLHFQ), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and full echocardiographical study before CRT implant and 3 and 12 months after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction showed a time-related improvement in the whole population (+10.6% over 12 months) as well as in each subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of LVEF improvement was similar in elderly and non-elderly patients (+13.6 vs. +7.9%; P = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular diameters, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, New York Heart Association class, MLHFQ score, and QRS width <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed a time-related improvement in the whole population as well as in each subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>End-diastolic left ventricular diameter remodelling and QRS width reduction were significantly more pronounced in the elderly, whereas other clinical and instrumental secondary endpoints showed a similar improvement between ≥75 and &lt;75 years old patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference regarding mortality between elderly and non-elderly patients.CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy is as effective in improving LVEF in elderly as in non-elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age alone should not be a determinant to restrict resynchronization therapy in HF patients </plain></SENT>
