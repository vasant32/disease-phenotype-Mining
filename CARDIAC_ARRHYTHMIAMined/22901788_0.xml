<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected in two ways: retrospectively using a standardized questionnaire, and prospectively from a central database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each participating center selected its own preferred method of data collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-six Spanish centers voluntarily contributed data to the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some 9662 ablation procedures were analyzed, averaging 146 (104) per center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three main conditions treated were atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n=2537; 26%), typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (n=2205; 23%) and accessory pathways (n=1813; 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was the fourth most common substrate treated (n=1535; 16%) and showed a slight increase over figures for 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation has increased considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate was 94%; major complications occurred in 2.2% and overall mortality was 0.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from the 2011 registry show a continued increase in the number of ablations performed with a generally high success rate and few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of complex substrate ablation continues to grow </plain></SENT>
