<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study sought to assess cognitive and emotional functions among children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011688'>atrioventricular reentry tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT) and atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>113 patients (62 girls and 51 boys ages, 9-18 years) scheduled for radiofrequency ablation due to AVRT or AVNRT underwent neuropsychologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study excluded patients who had experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e>, or other diseases affecting cognitive or emotional development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized tests for examining verbal and visual memory as well as visual-spatial functioning were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For patients exhibiting deficits in two or more tests, a diagnosis of "<z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>" was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were tested using the State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were found in 47.8 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age at first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> attack was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at which the first symptoms occurred was significantly lower for patients with deficits (8.3 years) than for patients who had no deficit (10.2 years) (t = 2.15; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Boys exhibited a significantly higher level of trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than girls (t = 3.42; p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant negative correlation was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and the age at appearance of the first symptoms (r = -0.26; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings led us to conclude that cognitive and emotional developments can be negatively affected by AVNRT and AVRT, particularly if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> appears early in life </plain></SENT>
