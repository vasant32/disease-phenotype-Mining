<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left-ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction(LVHT) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology, frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases LVHT is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> (NMDs) or other rare non-neuromuscular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, LVHT occurs familiarly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Invited for a cardiologic investigation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> first-degree relatives of index patients with LVHT who attended the cardiologic department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether 25 relatives of 15 index patients from 15 families were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three members each were investigated in 3 families, 2 patients each in 4 families and 1 member each in 8 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 relatives from the 15 families, LVHT was found in 4 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, familial LVHT was detected in 4 of the 15 investigated families (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 4 relatives with LVHT, extension and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were similar to the appropriate index patient in 2 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A NMD was diagnosed in three of the four relatives (75%) with familial LVHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One relative without LVHT presented with a history of Fallot's tetralogy, and two relatives each presented with thickening of the left-ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LVHT is familial in at least 27% of the patients with LVHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LVHT may differ between relatives in some of the patients with familial LVHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Familial LVHT is associated with a NMD in the majority of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Relatives of LVHT patients may present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> other than LVHT </plain></SENT>
