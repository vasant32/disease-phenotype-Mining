<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Studies have shown that remote magnetic navigation is safe and effective for ablation of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, although optimal outcomes often require frequent manual manipulation of a circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Vdrive robotic system ('Vdrive') was designed for remote navigation of circular mapping catheters to enable a fully remote procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study details the first human clinical experience with remote circular catheter manipulation in the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, multi-centre, non-randomized consecutive case series that included patients presenting for catheter ablation of left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remote systems were used exclusively to manipulate both the circular mapping catheter and the ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed through hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients were included in the study, including 23 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), 48 with persistent AF, and 15 suffering from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The population was predominately male (77%) with a mean age of 60.5 ± 11.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Vdrive was used for remote navigation between veins, creation of chamber maps, and gap identification with segmental isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intended <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical endpoints were achieved in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean case time was 225.9 ± 70.5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients (3.2%) crossed over to manual circular mapping catheter navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events related to the use of the remote manipulation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that remote manipulation of a circular mapping catheter in the ablation of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized studies are needed to prove efficiency improvements over manual techniques </plain></SENT>
