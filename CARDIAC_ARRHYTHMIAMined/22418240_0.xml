<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the impact of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment on dyssynchrony in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of sixty patients who had uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> that had never been treated (treatment-naïve hypertensive patients) underwent echocardiographic evaluations of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony at baseline and after a 6-month treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measured parameters were as follows: (1) the s.d. of 12 LV-segment time-to-peak systolic velocities (Ts-SD12), and (2) the maximal difference between peak systolic velocities of any 2 of the 12 segments (Ts-Max) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with Ts-SD12 ≥ 33 ms or Ts-Max ≥ 100 ms were regarded as having LV systolic dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with systolic dyssynchrony (group 1, n = 29) and without systolic dyssynchrony (group 2, n = 31) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the patients in group 1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment significantly improved LV systolic dyssynchrony (ΔTs-SD12, -13.1 ms; P&lt;0.001 and ΔTs-Max, -34.0 ms; P = 0.003), whereas it did not demonstrate additional benefit among group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in LV systolic dyssynchrony was significantly associated with changes in the mean annulus E' velocity, mean annulus S' velocity and mean annulus E'/A' ratio, but not with changes in blood pressure and LV mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is likely that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment could reverse the LV systolic dyssynchrony and simultaneously improve subclinical systolic and diastolic function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and LV systolic dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
