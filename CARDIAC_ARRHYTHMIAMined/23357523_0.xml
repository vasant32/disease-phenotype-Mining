<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thoracic epidural anaesthesia, by reducing sympathetic stress, may ameliorate the haemodynamic changes occurring during OPCAB surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the impact of thoracic epidural anaesthesia on intraoperative haemodynamics in patients undergoing OPCAB surgery.METHODSTwo hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized to either general anaesthesia plus epidural (GAE) (n = 109) or general anaesthesia (GA) only (n = 117) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured before sternotomy and subsequently after positioning the heart for each distal anastomosis.RESULTSBoth groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics and received a standardized anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MAP decreased in both groups with no significant difference (mean difference (GAE minus GA) -1.11, 95% CI -3.06 to 0.84, P = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HR increased in both groups after sternotomy but was significantly less in the GAE group (mean difference (GAE minus GA) -4.29, 95% CI -7.10 to -1.48, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CVP also increased in both groups after sternotomy, but the difference between the groups varied over time (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A difference was observed at the third anastomosis when the heart was in position for the revascularization of the circumflex artery (mean difference (GAE minus GA) +2.09, 95% CI 0.21-3.96, P = 0.03), but not at other time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was also significantly lower in the GAE compared with the GA group (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.78, P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONThoracic epidural with general anaesthesia minimizes the intraoperative haemodynamic changes that occur during heart positioning and stabilization for distal coronary anastomosis in OPCAB surgery </plain></SENT>
