<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevation of SNAP concentration or further stretch of the tissue (presumably, it increases NO concentration) eliminated the hump depolarization induced by moderate SNAP stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, low NO opens the stretch-activated channels while high NO inactivates them </plain></SENT>
