<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ventricular arrhythmogenesis is attributable to increase in repolarization <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> that is characterized by spatial dispersion of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to study the delayed effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, the most frequently used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>, on repolarization <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the ventricular epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">Doxorubicin</z:chebi> was administered to rats in a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg (six equal intraperitoneal injections over a period of 2 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six weeks after the last injection, electrophysiological mapping of the ventricular epicardium was performed by sequential superimposition of a 64-electrode array on the left ventricular base, left ventricular apex, right ventricular base, and right ventricular apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-treated rats, ARIs were inhomogeneously prolonged, the overall ARI dispersion and local ARI dispersions were increased, and the interregional differences in ARI dispersion were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>-induced inhomogeneous prolongation of repolarization of the ventricular epicardium results in increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ventricular repolarization because of increasing intraregional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> while interregional differences are lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repolarization of the right ventricle is more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> than that of the left one </plain></SENT>
