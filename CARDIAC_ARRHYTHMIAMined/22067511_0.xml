<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous bidomain simulation studies have investigated cathodal and anodal make/break mechanisms of cardiac excitation and strength-interval (S-I) curves in two-dimensional sheets or cylindrical domains, that by symmetry reduce to the two-dimensional case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, cathodal and anodal S-I curves are studied by means of detailed bidomain simulations which include: (i) three-dimensional cardiac slabs; (ii) transmural fiber rotation; (iii) unequal orthotropic anisotropy of the conducting media; (iv) incorporation of funny and electroporation currents in the ventricular membrane model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predicted shape of cathodal and anodal S-I curves exhibit the same features of the S-I curves observed experimentally and the break/make transition coincides with the final descending phase of the S-I curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Away from the break/make transition, only the break or make excitation mechanism is observed independently of the stimulus strength, whereas within an interval at the break/make transition, new paradoxical excitation behaviors are observed that depend on the stimulus strength </plain></SENT>
