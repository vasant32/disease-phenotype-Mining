<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to highlight the important advances from the year 2012 regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in adult CHD, with a focus on diagnostic considerations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management, catheter ablation, and device therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: During the course of 2012, Holter studies suggested that routine screening was helpful in guiding the clinical decisions for certain patient subgroups, such as adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supportive evidence was provided for the common practice of anticoagulation and/or screening for intracardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by transesophageal echocardiography prior to electrically cardioverting atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advances in catheter ablation, particularly robotic magnetic navigation, offer new hope for patients in whom access to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates is not feasible by standard means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subcutaneous defibrillator emerged as an innovative solution of great interest to the patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in whom transvenous lead implantation is unachievable or contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, 2012 ended with a major milestone: the establishment of physician certification in adult CHD by the American Board of Medical Specialties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The year 2012 witnessed important advances in the diagnosis and management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in adults with CHD </plain></SENT>
