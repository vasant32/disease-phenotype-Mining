<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> findings can be a challenge to interpret and difficult to attribute to background incidence or test article treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a growing need to better understand <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence in the experimental animal models used to assess the cardiovascular safety of new drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is little information on the frequency of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the cynomolgus monkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study evaluated the baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rate in a group (n=19) of non-na√Øve (drug-free) male telemetered cynomolgus monkeys at various timepoints over a 6 month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When sampled, data were collected continuously (24 hour bins over a 6 month period) and the ECG waveforms analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> using a semi-automated approach with pattern recognition software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> data were evaluated to detect atrial and ventricular patterns, as well as changes associated with circadian rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evaluation of this data showed that cynomolgus monkeys can exhibit spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (day cycle; means) of the following types: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature contraction</z:e> (SPC, 10.7%); escape beats (EB, 3.8%); and sinus node pause (SNP, 2.8%), with others below 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the ventricular perspective, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPB</z:mp>, 25.4% (day cycle mean)) were the most prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Circadian analysis indicated that some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> had higher incidence during the night cycle: SNP (32.6%); EB (18.5%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB, 2.7%), an indication that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> pattern is influenced by the diurnal cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Overall, the data demonstrated that a variety of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occur at low frequency in non-treated animals, and the incidence varies between animals, and within the same animal when repeatedly sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the low incidence in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, continuous ECG sampling over multiple days is needed to establish an accurate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> "fingerprint" for each animal in dedicated telemetry colonies, which could assist the interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> findings that may occur in cardiovascular safety studies </plain></SENT>
