<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purposes of our study were to: (1) determine lead failure rate in a large single-center cohort of Sprint Fidelis 6949 (Fidelis) leads, (2) define the risk of lead failure over time, (3) assess the impact of the Lead Integrity Alert (LIA) on lead failure presentation, and (4) identify independent predictors of Fidelis lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent implantation of a Fidelis lead between September 2004 and July 2007 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and device characteristics at the time of implant and prior to failure were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 971 Fidelis leads (706 men, 265 women,mean age 68.4±12.8 years) were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 46.3 months, there were 69 lead failures(7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year lead survival rate was 90.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of lead failure demonstrated a double-peaked pattern at 34 and 61 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, there were no independent predictors of lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate shocks(IS) were the first sign of lead failure in 29 patients (42%).The incidence (32.6% vs. 65.2%, p=0.01) and number ofIS (2.8±7.2 vs. 11.3±18.7, p=0.01) were significantly lower in patients with LIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a single-center experience on the natural history of the Fidelis lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our experience, lead survival declines at a lower rate when compared to prior reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of lead failure demonstrated a double peaked pattern at approximately 3 and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No identified variable was predictive of lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LIA was effective in reducing the incidence and number of IS </plain></SENT>
