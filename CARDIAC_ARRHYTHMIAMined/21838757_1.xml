<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiac toxicity is a major concern in drug development and it is imperative that clinical candidates are thoroughly tested for adverse effects earlier in the drug discovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we investigate the utility of an impedance-based microelectronic detection system in conjunction with mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for assessment of compound risk in the drug discovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Beating of cardiomyocytes was measured by a recently developed microelectronic-based system using impedance readouts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used mouse stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to obtain dose-response profiles for over 60 compounds, including ion channel modulators, chronotropic/ionotropic agents, hERG trafficking inhibitors and drugs known to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: This system sensitively and quantitatively detected effects of modulators of cardiac function, including some compounds missed by electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pro-arrhythmic compounds produced characteristic profiles reflecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which can be used for identification of other pro-arrhythmic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time series data can be used to identify compounds that induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> by complex mechanisms such as inhibition of hERG channels trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the time resolution allows for assessment of compounds that simultaneously affect both beating and viability of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Microelectronic monitoring of stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte beating provides a high throughput, quantitative and predictive assay system that can be used for assessment of cardiac liability earlier in the drug discovery process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The convergence of stem cell technology with microelectronic monitoring should facilitate cardiac safety assessment </plain></SENT>
