<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> can be performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation at the physician's preference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We randomized a series of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation to either general anesthesia or conscious sedation to assess differences in pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) reconnection during redo procedures and impact on success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 257 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing AF ablation were enrolled and randomized to either conscious sedation with fentanyl or midazolam (128 patients, group 1) and general anesthesia (129 patients, group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a high dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> up to 30 μg/min was used to disclose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnection or extra <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> firings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 17 ± 8 month follow-up after the first ablation, 88 (69%) patients in group 1 were free of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> off <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), as compared with 114 (88%) in group 2 (log-rank P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with recurrence had a second procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the repeat procedure, 42% (66 of 158) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in group 1 had recovered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> conduction, compared with 19% (11 of 57) in group 2 (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with group 1, group 2 had a significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (53 ± 9 min vs. 84 ± 21 min, P &lt;.001) and procedure time (2.4 ± 1.4 h vs. 3.6 ± 1.1 h, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of general anesthesia is associated with higher cure rate with a single procedure, and it seems to reduce the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnection observed at the time of repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
