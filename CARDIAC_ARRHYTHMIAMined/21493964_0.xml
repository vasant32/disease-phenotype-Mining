<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiac MRI (LGE-CMR) can accurately identify myocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective, single-center observational study to evaluate the association between the extent and distribution of left ventricular scar, quantified using LGE-CMR, and the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients included (2006 to 2009) had undergone LGE-CMR before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scar (defined as myocardium with a signal intensity ≥50% of the maximum in scar tissue) was characterized in terms of percent scar, scar surface area, and number of transmural left ventricular scar segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point was appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients (mean age, 66±11 years; male sex, 51) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 19±10 months follow-up, appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy occurred in 19 (30%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analyses, both percent scar (hazard ratio per 10%, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.81; P=0.02) and number of transmural scar segments (hazard ratio per segment, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.70; P=0.001) were significantly associated with the occurrence of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the extent of myocardial scar characterized by LGE-CMR was significantly associated with the occurrence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that scar quantification by LGE-CMR may prove a valuable risk stratification tool for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which may have implications for patient selection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
