<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Exposure to single pollutants e.g. particulate matter (PM) is associated with adverse health effects, but it does not represent a real world scenario that usually involves multiple pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Determine if simultaneous exposure to PM and NO₂ results in synergistic interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy young volunteers were exposed to clean air, <z:chebi fb="34" ids="33101">nitrogen dioxide</z:chebi> (NO₂, 0.5 ppm), concentrated fine particles from Chapel Hill air (PM(2.5)CAPs, 89.5 ± 10.7 µg/m³), or NO₂+PM(2.5)CAPs for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject performed intermittent exercise during the exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters of heart rate variability (HRV), changes in repolarization, peripheral blood endpoints and lung function were measured before and 1 and 18 h after exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h after exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NO₂ exposure alone increased cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> 18 h after exposure, decreased high frequency component of HRV one and 18 h after exposure, decreased QT variability index 1 h after exposure, and increased LDH in BAL fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant change with PM(2.5)CAPs was an increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> 1 h after exposure, likely due to the low concentrations of PM(2.5)CAPs in the exposure chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure to both NO₂ and PM(2.5)CAPs increased BAL α1-antitrypsin, mean t wave amplitude, the low frequency components of HRV and the LF/HF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes were not observed following exposure to NO₂ or PM(2.5)CAPs alone, suggesting possible interactions between the two pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: NO₂ exposure may produce and enhance <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiovascular effects of PM(2.5)CAPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment of health effects by ambient PM should consider its interactions with gaseous copollutants </plain></SENT>
