<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal imaging frame rates, in terms of the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio, to capture the EW cannot be achieved due to the limitations of conventional imaging sequences, in which the frame rate is low and tied to the imaging parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve higher frame rates, EWI is typically performed by combining sectors acquired during separate heartbeats, which are then combined into a single view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the frame rates achieved remain potentially sub-optimal and this approach precludes the study of non-periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a temporally unequispaced acquisition sequence (TUAS) for which a wide range of frame rates are achievable independently of the imaging parameters, while maintaining a full view of the heart at high beam density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUAS is first used to determine the optimal frame rate for EWI in a paced canine heart in vivo and then to image during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate how EWI can be optimally performed within a single heartbeat, during free breathing and in real time, for both periodic and non-periodic cardiac events </plain></SENT>
