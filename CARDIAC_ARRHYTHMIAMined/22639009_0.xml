<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to review the natural history of patients with fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, determine the incidence of postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and determine whether there are factors to predict which fetuses will develop postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review of patients with fetal tachyarrhythmias investigated at British Columbia Children's and Women's Hospitals between 1983 and 2010 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-nine mother-fetus pairs were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two had fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and 17 had fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred prenatally in 52 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred in two thirds of patients, with 82 % of those cases occurring within the first 48 h of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001789'>Hydrops fetalis</z:hpo>, female sex, and lack of conversion to sinus rhythm was predictive of postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversion to sinus rhythm prenatally did not predict postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median duration of treatment was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of unknown etiology occurred </plain></SENT>
