<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A historical outline of the evolution of electrophysiology from the eighteenth century is shortly presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Topics concerning the so called animal electricity starting from the observations on descharges of Torpedo fish until Bolognese Galvani's researches on the frogs are exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The points of view of their oppositionists also are examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These ones, leaded by the physicist Alessandro Volta, professor in the University of Pavia, believed that electricity detected by galvanists was not inherent to animal but was due to the action of the metallic conductors present in the circuit: contact electricity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only towards the middle of the nineteenth century the physicist Carlo Matteucci attained to demonstrate the existente of the real animal electricity in form of injury current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was possible to determine that quantitatively thanks to the capillary electrometer built in 1872 by the French physicist Gabriel Lippmann </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This instrument was used by the English physiologist Waller in order to obtain the primitive electrocardiographic tracings in humans (1887) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At beginnings of the twentieth century, the Dutch professor Willem Einthoven, of the University of Leiden, introduced his string galvanometer which permitted to allow the modern electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So it was possible to record the electrical potentials of myocardial cells, first in vitro, later in isolated and perfused heart, son after in dog's heart in situ and finally in human heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore now it is possible to effectuate endocardial and epicardial mappings, indispensable in order to diagnose and treat the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
