<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the high number of admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHF</z:e>), there are no specific criteria for discharge readiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A number of patients have implantable devices that might provide data to assist in determining readiness for discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The 3D-HF (Diagnostic Data for Discharge in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Patients) study was a prospective observational pilot study enrolling HF patients with Optivol-capable cardiac devices within 48 hours of a hospital admission characterized by worsening HF symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the difference in times from admission to 50% improvement in impedance and to when patient was medically ready for discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nonparametric sign test was used to determine if the difference was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 20 subjects were enrolled over a 24-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHF</z:e> length of stay was 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 subjects, 18 achieved the intrathoracic impedance improvement threshold before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time to reach the threshold for improvement was 2.5 days (interquartile range 2.0-6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between days to 50% impedance and days to provider's discharge decision was 3.0 (PÂ = .0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intrathoracic impedance changes were evident over a short duration in the majority of patients admitted for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHF</z:e> and may be a potential criterion for discharge readiness </plain></SENT>
