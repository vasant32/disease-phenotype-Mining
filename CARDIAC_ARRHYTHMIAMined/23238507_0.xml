<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> and biatrial pacing have been reported to be effective in AF prophylaxis after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this trial was to compare the efficacy of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> versus biatrial pacing combined with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> in the prevention of AF after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: A single-centre prospective randomized open trial of 165 consecutive patients undergoing their first CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> infusion 1-3 mg per hour or biatrial overdrive pacing and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (50-150mg) daily for 72 hours after CABG starting immediately after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AAI pacing with a pacing rate of 10 beats/minute above the baseline heart rate was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had continuous ECG-monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the first episode of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: The incidence of postoperative AF in the intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> and biatrial pacing groups did not differ from each other (14% vs. 18% respectively, p=0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the time of AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between the groups (28.2 ± 16.2 h vs. 30.1 ± 21.2 h respectively, p = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> infusion had to be temporarily interrupted for one hour in eleven patients because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the left atria related to the pacemaker electrode wire was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: We found no difference in the incidence of AF between patients treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> or the combination of biatrial pacing and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
