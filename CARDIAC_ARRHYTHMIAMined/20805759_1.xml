<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hypertonic saline solutions in combination with colloids may have some applications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the effects of small volumes (0.7-1 mL/kg intravenous) of 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with different colloids on cardiac stability, hemodynamics, and mortality after severe hemorrhagic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male fed Sprague-Dawley rats (300-450 g, n = 48) were anesthetized and randomly assigned to one of six groups: (1) untreated (bleed only), (2) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, (3) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-70</z:chebi>, (4) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/6% hetastarch (HES), (5) 6% HES alone, and (6) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/10% HES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic shock was induced by phlebotomy until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 35 mm Hg to 40 mm Hg and continued for 20 minutes until ∼40% blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were left in shock for 60 minutes at 34°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>0.3 mL (&lt;4% of shed blood) was injected as a 10 seconds bolus into the femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lead II electrocardiogram, blood pressures, MAP, and heart rate were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Untreated rats were highly arrhythmogenic with 38% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> increased MAP from 39 mm Hg to 44 mm Hg with no severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-70</z:chebi> increased MAP from 38 mm Hg to 49 mm Hg, transiently <z:mp ids='MP_0010634'>increased QRS amplitude</z:mp> (1.5 times) and was arrhythmogenic affecting 50% of animals with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of 6% HES to hypertonic saline resulted in aberrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and 38% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six percent HES alone was proarrhythmic and led to 38% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with 10% HES resulted in 100% mortality (p &lt; 0.05) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> within 5 minutes of resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Small volumes of 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> led to fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and a 2.6 times survival benefit over untreated rats, and a partial resuscitation of MAP into the "permissive range." <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-70</z:chebi> or HES in 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> were proarrhythmic and HES led to increased mortality (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because optimal heart function is critical for successful resuscitation, care should be exercised when using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran-70</z:chebi> or 6 and 10% HES in small volume hypertonic saline solutions for early hypotensive resuscitation </plain></SENT>
