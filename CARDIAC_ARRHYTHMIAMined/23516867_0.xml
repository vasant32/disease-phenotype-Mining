<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to search for innovative methods for the assessment of the patients' conditions as a criterion for their rational choice for cardiosurgical intervention to enable adequate anesthesiological support and postoperative follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We revealed additional characteristics of cardiac rhythm variability facilitating such choice and predictors of the risk of life-threatening heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is shown that high-resolution analysis of cardiac rhythms allows such peculiarities of dynamics of patient's conditions to be revealed that can not be exposed by the existing standard methods </plain></SENT>
