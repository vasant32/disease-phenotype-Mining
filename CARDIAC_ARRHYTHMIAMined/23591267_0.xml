<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current drug therapies to suppress AF are incompletely and unpredictably effective and carry substantial risk of proarrhythmia and noncardiac toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The limited success of therapy for AF is partially the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the underlying substrate, interindividual differences in disease mechanisms, and our inability to predict response to therapies in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this Review, we discuss the evidence that variability in response to drug therapy is also conditioned by the underlying genetic substrate for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased susceptibility to AF is mediated through diverse genetic mechanisms, including modulation of the atrial action-potential duration, conduction slowing, and impaired cell-to-cell communication, as well as novel mechanisms, such as regulation of signalling proteins important in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the translation of genetic data to the care of the patients with AF has been limited because of poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with common AF-susceptibility loci, a dearth of prospective, adequately powered studies, and the challenges associated with determining efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>What is apparent, however, is the need for appropriately designed, genotype-directed clinical trials </plain></SENT>
