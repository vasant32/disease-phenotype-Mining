<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both technical skills (TS) and non-technical skills (NTS) are key to ensuring patient safety in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care practice and effective crisis management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These skills are often taught and assessed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that TS and NTS are not independent of each other, and we aimed to evaluate the relationship between TS and NTS during a simulated intraoperative crisis scenario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of performances from a previously published work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After institutional ethics approval, 50 anaesthesiology residents managed a simulated crisis scenario of an intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> secondary to a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a modified Delphi approach to design a TS checklist, specific for the management of a malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> requiring defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scenarios were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each performance was analysed by four independent experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For each performance, two experts independently rated the technical performance using the TS checklist, and two other experts independently rated NTS using the Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TS and NTS were significantly correlated to each other (r=0.45, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During a simulated 5 min resuscitation requiring crisis resource management, our results indicate that TS and NTS are related to one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This research provides the basis for future studies evaluating the nature of this relationship, the influence of NTS training on the performance of TS, and to determine whether NTS are generic and transferrable between crises that require different TS </plain></SENT>
