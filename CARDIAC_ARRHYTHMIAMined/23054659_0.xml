<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a stepwise progressive ablation protocol (pulmonary vein isolation, ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrogram, and repeat ablation of any induced atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 18-month follow-up, 59 % of group 1 patients remained in sinus rhythm without recurrent AF, compared to 64 % and 77 % in controls 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure time was longer in LPAF with a higher procedure complication risk in these 44 LPAF patients (5 % vs. 0 %) than in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that catheter ablation provides a practical treatment option with moderate efficacy for restoring sinus rhythm in LPAF patients after failed DCCV </plain></SENT>
