<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The most important step in the treatment of ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is to sustain myocardial blood supply as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two main treatment methods used today to provide myocardial reperfusion are thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our study, reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were investigated as if they are indicators of coronary artery patency or ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 151 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>54 patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and 97 patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of reperfusion arrythmias following revascularization procedures in the first 48 hours after admission was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relation between reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, ST segment regression, coronary artery patency, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> related artery documented by angiography were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the frequency of reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P = 0.355) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although angiographic vessel patency was higher in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, there was no significant difference between the patency rates of each group with and without reperfusion arrythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> following different revascularization procedures in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> may not always indicate vessel patency and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may lead to various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> which may not be distinguished from reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
