<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi> is often administered to patients for pain management, but it is also recommended to ameliorate some types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the effect of prolonged <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> treatment on myocardial adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling, which plays an important role in regulating heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The present work has investigated the consequences of 10-day administration of high <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> doses (10 mg/kg per day) to adult Wistar rats for functioning of the G-protein-mediated AC signaling system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi> treatment appreciably affected neither the number of myocardial β-adrenoceptors nor the content of selected subunits of trimeric G-proteins (G(s)α, G(i/o)α, G(z)α, G(q/11)α and Gβ) but the amount of the dominant myocardial AC isoform V/VI almost doubled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These alterations were accompanied by a marked AC supersensitization: the enzyme activity stimulated by <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="17051">fluoride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> was considerably increased (by about 50-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ability of opioid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> to inhibit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>-stimulated AC activity was slightly but significantly decreased in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides that, <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> markedly decreased the incidence of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but did not significantly influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, these results indicate that prolonged treatment of rats with high doses of <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> substantially alters the function of myocardial G-protein-regulated AC signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These alterations are accompanied by a reduced susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
