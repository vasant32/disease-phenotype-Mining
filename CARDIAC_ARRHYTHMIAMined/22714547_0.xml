<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in subsets of patients with AF, but primarily in patients age &lt;65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> safety in patients age ≥65 vs. those &lt;65 who have undergone catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from two Thomson Reuters MarketScan® research databases was performed on 5,947 patients who underwent catheter ablation for treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> safety was measured as a composite endpoint of procedure-related adverse events coded ≤7 days post-procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model was fitted to this endpoint, using age (&lt;65, ≥65) and relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peri-procedural mortality rates were examined among patients with inpatient ablation procedures, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates could be determined by discharge status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> safety event rate was nearly identical between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding persisted after adjusting for covariates in the logistic regression model (p = 0.6648) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no peri-procedural mortalities among the 3,575 index ablation procedures performed in an inpatient setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> safety of catheter ablation for AF in patients ≥65 was consistent with that of younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with a high risk for complications with AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings in a large, real world population may have implications for Medicare patients with AF </plain></SENT>
