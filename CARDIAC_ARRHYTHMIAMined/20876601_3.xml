<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective randomized study to compare the clinical efficacy of standard 8 mm Pt-Ir tip catheter (control) and 8 mm gold-tip catheters in the ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 463 patients undergoing CTI ablation in 19 clinical centres were randomized to receive the treatment by gold-tip or control catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was cumulative radiofrequency (RF) application duration until achieving bidirectional CTI block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It did not differ significantly for the two catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gold-tip catheter was, however, associated with a higher ablation success rate (94.3 vs. 89.0%, P = 0.042) and a substantially lower incidence of char and coagulum formation (4.8 vs. 37.9%, P &lt; 0.001), which required exchange of 1 gold-tip (0.4%) and 10 control catheters (4.6%, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gold-tip catheter delivered more mean power (52 ± 12 W) than the control catheter (48 ± 13 W, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both mean and maximum temperatures measured by the thermocouple integrated in the catheter tip were statistically significantly lower in the gold (mean: 53.2 ± 4.7°C, max: 68.7 ± 6.6°C) than in the control catheter (54.3 ± 5.2 and 70.2 ± 7.0°C, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy time, procedure duration, procedural-related complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence during 6 months of follow-up did not differ between the two catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Owing to a higher primary ablation success rate and reduced incidence of char/coagulum formation, gold may be preferred over Pt-Ir as electrode material for 8 mm tip catheters for CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
