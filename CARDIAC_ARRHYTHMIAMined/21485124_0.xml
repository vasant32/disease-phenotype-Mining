<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In case 1, a woman transferred to our emergency department, presented with severe circulatory failure and developed cardiopulmonary arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She received prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and initiated with PCPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case 2, a woman presented our emergency department on foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 hours after admission, she falled into severe circulatory failure with polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and PCPS was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> remains widely used despite its dangerous cardiovascular and neurological effects in overdosed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> overdose is cardiovascular toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In current guidelines, cardiopulmonary resuscitation with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass may be particularly effective for these patients to have a reversible etiology without preceding multisystem organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiotoxicities in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> overdose are reversible and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support should be promptly considered in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> despite conventional advanced life support </plain></SENT>
