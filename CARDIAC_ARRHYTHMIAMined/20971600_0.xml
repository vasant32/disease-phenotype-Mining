<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to explore the association between physical fitness and the likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the likelihood of ACS would be lower in physically fit patients and higher in patients with exercise-induced CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study involved a prospective, descriptive cohort in an academic suburban ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were ED patients with CP admitted for suspected ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data were collected by trained research assistants using standardized forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were surveyed on level of fitness and whether they had ever experienced anginal type symptoms during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome was considered present if the patient had electrocardiographic evidence of infarction or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; elevated troponin I levels; greater than 70% stenosis of culprit coronary artery; or a positive nuclear, echocardiographic, or treadmill stress test result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients readmitted within 30 days for reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were also considered to have ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between physical fitness and ACS was determined using χ(2) tests and odds ratios (ORs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 55.8 (±15.3) years; 36% were female; 85% were white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (13%) patients had positive troponins, 22 of 36 catheterized patients had greater than 70% <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo>, and 6 (6%) had abnormal stress test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or reinfarctions within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of ACS was similar in patients who were physically fit and those who were not (24% vs 37%; OR, 0.5 [95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.3]) and in patients who had experienced exercise-induced CP and those who had not (32% vs 29%; OR, 1.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.4-3.2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither the frequency nor the intensity of exercise was associated with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physically fit patients with CP were as likely to have ACS as those not physically fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A history of exercise-induced CP was not associated with an increased likelihood of ACS </plain></SENT>
