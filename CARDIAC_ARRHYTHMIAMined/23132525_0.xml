<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> can exhibit strong regional organizations, which makes the overlap zone between the fast paced rhythmic VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> even more ambiguous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Considering that implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) are primarily rate dependent detectors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and that there may be patients who suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that fall in the overlap zone, it is essential to identify the degree of affinity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> toward VT or organized/disorganized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method proposed in this work better categorizes the overlap zone using Wavelet analysis of surface ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three surface ECG signal segments from the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH database were used to classify between VT, organized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (OVF), and disorganized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (DVF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A two-level binary classifier was used to first extract VT with an overall accuracy of 93.7% and then the separation between OVF and DVF with an accuracy of 80.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed approach could assist clinicians to provide optimal therapeutic solutions for patients in the overlap zone of VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
