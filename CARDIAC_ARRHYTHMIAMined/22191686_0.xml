<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MHM displayed hNav1.5 sodium channel blocking activity, and tests indicate it to be âˆ¼2-fold more potent than the parent mexiletine and to have more favorable toxicological properties than mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, MHM and possible related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrugs</z:chebi> might be studied as agents for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, neuropathic pain, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002486'>myotonias</z:hpo> in substitution of mexiletine (metabolite switch), which has turned out to be tainted with common toxicity </plain></SENT>
