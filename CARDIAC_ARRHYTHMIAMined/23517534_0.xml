<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy efficacy was assessed using common regimens in this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2007 to 2011, the clinical records of stage IIB-IIIA <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> patients undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gathered data were tested for significance and variables impacting survival were assessed by univariate and Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 84% of patients were male and 93% had central disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">Platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy protocols with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> or paclitaxel gave an overall response rate of 55% (45/82) and 6.1% pathological complete response (5/82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical response was unassociated with regimen or histology, while more pneumonectomies were performed in the stable compared to partial response disease group (P =0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality was 1.2% (1/82), and complications, unassociated with regimen or histology, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> (26.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right-sided procedures appeared to increase the incidence of bronchopleural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (P =0.073) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median disease-free survival time was 18 months and median overall survival time was not reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival rates at one, two, and three years were 54%, 47%, and 33%, while the overall survival rate was 73%, 69%, and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival predictors were radiographic response and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> before chemotherapy (P =0.012 and 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two cycles of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="175901">gemcitabine</z:chebi> or paclitaxel is efficacious for patients with stage IIB-IIIA central disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients achieving clinical response had improved disease-free survival times, while those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> had a higher postoperative recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
