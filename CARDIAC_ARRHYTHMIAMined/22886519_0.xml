<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The effects of radio-frequency ablation (RFA) on blood pressure (BP) regulation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that patients with successful ablation had a lower BP and/or lesser utilization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drug</z:chebi> therapy during follow-up when compared to patients with failed ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective evaluation of patients with AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treated with ablation at the University of Utah between July 2006 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BP and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications were assessed at baseline and 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 167 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were excluded due to the need for AAD therapy beyond the blanking period thus leaving 80 patients in the success group and 79 patients in the failure group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean BP and HR at baseline were not significant between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the success group, the mean systolic BP decreased from a baseline value of 129 ± 17 to 125 ± 14 mmHg at 1 year (p = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the failure group, the mean systolic BP increased from a baseline value of 124 ± 16 to 127 ± 14 mmHg at 1 year (p = 0.176) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Between-group comparison revealed a p value of 0.026 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimal changes in diastolic BP were noted in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have shown that successful catheter ablation in patients with AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with a decrease in systolic BP when compared to an increase in patients with failed ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that restoring sinus rhythm could have an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effect in patients with AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
