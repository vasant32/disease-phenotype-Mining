<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These procedures require significant fluoroscopy exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new 3D non-fluoroscopic navigation system (CARTO(®) 3 System, Biosense Webster, CA, USA) that allows precise location visualization of diagnostic and ablation catheters was evaluated for its impact on fluoroscopic exposure during AF ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two groups of patients were treated by our centres for drug refractory AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group was treated using the new CARTO(®) 3 system to guide catheter ablation (Group A, 117 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other group was treated using the CARTO(®) XP system (Biosense Webster) 3 months previously (Group B, 123 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For both groups, circumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia ablation was performed; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation was validated using a circular catheter placed at each ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in any clinical characteristics (age, sex, AF type, left atrium diameter and volume, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>) among the two study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> identified and isolated per patient was similar in both groups, as were the mean procedural duration and radiofrequency time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, mean fluoroscopic time was significantly reduced in Group A (15.9±12.3 min) as compared with Group B (26±15.1 min) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This multicentre observational study demonstrates a significant reduction of fluoroscopy exposure using a new 3D non-fluoroscopic mapping system to guide AF catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
