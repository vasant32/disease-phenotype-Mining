<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective cross sectional study done at the Punjab Institute of Cardiology, Lahore from January to July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, who were not treated with primary angioplasty but were thrombolysed were recruited at the time of arrival in the emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Streptokinase was administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients as the agent for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG was taken at baseline and at 60 minutes post streptokinase administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were subsequently divided into two groups: (A) Non Diabetics, (B) Diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cohort was followed up through the in hospital stay for major complications which were recurrent ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were included in the study, 146 males and 36 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In non diabetic group, ST segment resolution occurred in 74 (84%) out of 88 patients and in diabetics, 13 (13.8%) out of 94 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In non diabetics, complications developed in 29 (32.9%) out of 88 patients and in diabetics, 75 (79.8%) out of 94 patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> with incorporate ST resolution compared to complete resolution were found to have more in hospital complications such as: recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (71.6% vs 23%, p &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (39.5% vs 15.3%, p = 0.0007), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (59.2% vs 15.3%, p &lt; 0.0001), mortality (7.4% vs 0%, p = 0.0082) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed in non diabetics: recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (57.1% vs 17.5%, p &lt; 0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (42.8% vs 14.8%, p = 0.0002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (50% vs 12.1%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant interaction was seen between diabetic status and ST segment resolution with respect to clinical outcome (recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.0001, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> p = 0.025, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.0001, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diabetics with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) encounter more adverse clinical outcome as predicted by incomplete ST resolution after thromboysis </plain></SENT>
