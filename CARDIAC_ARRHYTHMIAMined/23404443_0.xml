<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether experimentally induced increases in insulin by beta cell secretagogues, including glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1), will decrease vagal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respiration and ECGs were recorded for 130 healthy participants undergoing clamps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three variables of cardiac vagal effects (the root mean square of successive differences [rMSSD] in the interbeat interval of the heart rate [IBI], heart-rate variability [HRV] caused by peak-valley respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> [pvRSA], and high-frequency power <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29228">[HF]</z:chebi>) and heart rate (HR) were obtained at seven time points during the clamps, characterised by increasing levels of insulin (achieved by administering insulin plus <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> only, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GLP-1 combined with arginine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum insulin level was positively associated with HR at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points during the clamps except the first-phase hyperglycaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin levels were negatively correlated with variables of vagal control, reaching significance for rMSSD and log(10)HF, but not for pvRSA, during the last four phases of the hyperglycaemic clamp (hyperglycaemic second phase, GLP-1 first and second phases, and arginine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations disappeared when adjusted for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of the beta cell secretagogues GLP-1 and arginine led to a significant increase in HR, but this was not paired with a significant reduction in HRV measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Experimentally induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020459" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperinsulinaemia</z:e> is not correlated with cardiac vagal control or HR when adjusting for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that exposure to a GLP-1 during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> leads to a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in HR but not to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decrease in cardiac vagal control </plain></SENT>
