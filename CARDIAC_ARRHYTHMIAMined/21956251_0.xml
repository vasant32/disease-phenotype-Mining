<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few reports regarding its efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the potential benefits of on-pump beating-heart CABG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2002 to January 2010, 186 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis underwent CABG in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 82 patients underwent conventional CABG with cardioplegic arrest, 56 underwent off-pump CABG and 48 underwent on-pump beating-heart CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early results and long-term outcomes were compared among these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On-pump beating-heart CABG significantly reduced the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) compared with conventional CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-operative pericardial drainage amount (P &lt; 0.01), length of hospital stay (P &lt; 0.001) and length of post-operative intensive care unit stay (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in the on-pump beating-heart and off-pump CABG groups than in the conventional CABG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found regarding 30-day mortality and morbidity rates including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, intestinal complication and low cardiac output syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences in the freedom from cardiac events (P = 0.323), but on-pump beating-heart CABG provided better long-term survival than conventional CABG (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On-pump beating-heart CABG is a safe procedure that provides optimal operative exposure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of CPB and the elimination of cardioplegic arrest may be beneficial for the short- and long-term survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
