<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a subsequent syncopal episode and despite accidental destruction of his patient activator, vital ECG data from the event were transmitted wirelessly, enabling a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> to be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case highlights the benefit of remote monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> assessment, as well as a transmission system that ensures prompt analysis of the ECG data and therefore rapid optimal patient management </plain></SENT>
