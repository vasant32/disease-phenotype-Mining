<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the adult CHD population at risk of SCD and the clinical parameters associated with SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicenter case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who died suddenly as a result of proven or presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were included (cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each case, 2 controls matched on diagnosis, type of surgical intervention, age, and gender were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 3 databases including 25 790 adults with CHD, 1189 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5%) were identified, of whom 213 patients (19%) died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 171 of 1189 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying cardiac lesions were mild, moderate, and severe CHD in 12%, 33%, and 55% of the SCD cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables associated with SCD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-7.9; P=0.004), moderate to severe systemic ventricular dysfunction (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.4; P=0.034), moderate to severe subpulmonary ventricular dysfunction (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.1-10.2; P=0.030), increased QRS duration (OR, 1.34 [per 10-ms increase]; 95% CI, 1.10-1.34; P=0.008), and QT dispersion (OR, 1.22 [per 10-ms increase]; 95% CI, 1.22-1.48; P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical parameters found to be associated with SCD in adults with a broad spectrum of CHD, including systemic right ventricles, are similar to those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, even those patients with mild cardiac lesions are potentially at risk for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This highlights the need for further prospective studies as well as vigilant ongoing follow-up of the adult with CHD </plain></SENT>
