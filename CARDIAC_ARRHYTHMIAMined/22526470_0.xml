<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Via its interaction with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor Ca(2+) channel in the heart, cADPR may exert arrhythmogenic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we have studied the effect of novel cardiac ADPRC inhibitors in vitro and in vivo in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that two structurally distinct cardiac ADPRC inhibitors, SAN2589 and SAN4825, prevent the formation of spontaneous action potentials in guinea pig papillary muscle in vitro and that compound SAN4825 is active in vivo in delaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in a guinea pig model of Ca(2+) overload-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cardiac ADPRC prevents Ca(2+) overload-induced spontaneous depolarizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and may thus provide a novel therapeutic principle for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
