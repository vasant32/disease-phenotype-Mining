<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> are associated with significant morbidity and mortality related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent work illustrates that many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are initiated by a pathologic imbalance between kinase and phosphatase activities in excitable cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the relationship between myocyte kinase/phosphatase imbalance and cellular and whole animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> phenotypes associated with ankyrin-B cardiac syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using a combination of biochemical, electrophysiological, and in vivo approaches, we tested the ability of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) inhibition to rescue imbalance in kinase/phosphatase pathways associated with human ankyrin-B-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR(2)), a validated target of kinase/phosphatase regulation in myocytes, displays abnormal CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation (pS2814 hyperphosphorylation) in ankyrin-B(+/-) heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, RyR(2) dysregulation is rescued in myocytes from ankyrin-B(+/-) mice overexpressing a potent CaMKII-inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (AC3I), and aberrant RyR(2) open probability observed in ankyrin-B(+/-) hearts is normalized by treatment with the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition is sufficient to rescue abnormalities in ankyrin-B(+/-) myocyte electrical dysfunction including cellular afterdepolarizations, and significantly blunts whole animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in response to elevated sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the complexity of the molecular components involved in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and define regulatory elements of the ankyrin-B pathway in pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the findings illustrate the potential impact of CaMKII inhibition in the treatment of a congenital form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
