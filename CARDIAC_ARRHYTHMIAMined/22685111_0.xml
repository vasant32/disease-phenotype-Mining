<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the utilization rates in a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>)-eligible population and mortality in this group compared with a group that had undergone implantation of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort of patients from April 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009, was used to define a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-eligible population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were compared on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (no-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 717 patients found to be potentially eligible for a primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, 116 (16%) were referred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining cohort of 601 patients were compared with an existing cohort of primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients (n=290) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant survival benefit was associated with primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI [0.33-0.64]; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When adjusted for prespecified variables known to be associated with overall mortality and propensity score, a similar survival benefit was seen (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI [0.40-0.87]; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy occurred in 26% of those in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group, during a mean follow-up of 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant mortality benefit was observed for patients who underwent primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation compared with those who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vigilance is required to ensure that patients eligible for primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are appropriately referred and assessed to allow such patients to benefit from this life-saving therapy </plain></SENT>
