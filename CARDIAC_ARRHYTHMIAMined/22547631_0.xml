<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coupling between J(rel) and the AP occurs via L-type Ca(2+) channels (I(Ca)) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger (I(NCX)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a combined experimental and modelling approach to study interactions between J(rel), I(Ca) and I(NCX) in porcine ventricular myocytes.We tested the hypothesis that during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> uniform J(rel), the interaction between these fluxes can be represented as occurring in two myoplasmic subcompartments for Ca(2+) distribution, one (T-space) associated with RyR and enclosed by the junctional portion of the SR membrane and corresponding T-tubular portion of the sarcolemma, the other (M-space) encompassing the rest of the myoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>I(Ca) and I(NCX) were partitioned into subpopulations in the T-space and M-space sarcolemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We denoted free Ca(2+) concentrations in T-space and M-space Ca(t) and Ca(m), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were designed to allow separate measurements of I(Ca) and I(NCX) as a function of J(rel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of T-space in themodel allowed us to reproduce in silico the following important experimental results: (1) hysteresis of I(NCX) dependence on Ca(m); (2) delay between peak I(NCX) and peak Ca(m) during <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> application protocol; (3) delay between I(NCX) and Ca(m) during Ca(2+)-induced-Ca(2+)-release; (4) rapid I(Ca) inactivation (within 2 ms) due to J(rel), with magnitude graded as a function of the SR Ca(2+) content; (5) time delay between I(Ca) inactivation due to J(rel) and Ca(m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partition of 25% NCX in T-space and 75% in M-space provided the best fit to the experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measured Ca(m) and I(Ca) or I(NCX) were used as input to the model for estimating Ca(t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The actual model-computed Ca(t), obtained by simulating specific experimental protocols, was used as a gold standard for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The model predicted peak Ca(t) in the range of 6–25 μM, with time to equilibrium of Ca(t) with Ca(m) of ~350 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These Ca(t) values are in the range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> and RyR sensitivity to Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increase of the SR Ca(2+) load increased the time to equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The I(Ca)-based estimation method was most accurate during the ascending phase of Ca(t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The I(NCX)-based method provided a good estimate for the descending phase of Ca(t) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, application of both methods in combination provides the best estimate of the entire Ca(t) time course </plain></SENT>
