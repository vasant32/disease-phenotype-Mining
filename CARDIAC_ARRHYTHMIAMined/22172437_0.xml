<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>), the importance of a well-balanced inflammatory reaction has been recognized for years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monocytes play essential roles in regulating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we investigated the association between inflammatory characteristics of monocytes and myocardial injury and functional outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using flow cytometry, the levels of classical (CD14(++)CD62L(+)) and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD62L(-)) monocytes were analyzed in peripheral blood in 58 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> at a median of 5 days (4-6 days) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the monocytic expression of several surface molecules and formation of monocyte-platelet complexes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 4-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, patients with high levels of classical monocytes had impaired left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (P = .002), larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (P = .001), and, often, presence of microvascular obstruction (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, high levels of classical monocytes were negatively associated with the regional systolic LV function independent of the transmural extent of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, positive associations for the levels of nonclassical monocytes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, up-regulation of macrophage 1 by blood monocytes and increased formation of monocyte-platelet complexes were associated with enhanced myocardial injury at baseline and impaired LV function at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an association between a proinflammatory monocyte response, characterized by high levels of classical monocytes, and severe myocardial injury and poor functional outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies are required to investigate the biologic nature of this association and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
