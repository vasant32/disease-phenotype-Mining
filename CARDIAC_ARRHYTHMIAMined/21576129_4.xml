<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm Trial to assess the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> 400 mg bid for the prevention of cardiovascular Hospitalization or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause in patiENTs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (ATHENA), a composite of first CV hospitalization or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This post hoc analysis evaluated the secondary endpoint of CV hospitalization and the clinical benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> on the number and duration of CV hospitalizations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: ATHENA was a double-blind, parallel group study in 4628 patients with a history of paroxysmal/persistent AF and additional risk factors, treated with placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> treatment significantly reduced the risk of first CV hospitalization (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo), while the risk of first non-CV hospitalization was similar in both groups (P = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>About half of the CV hospitalizations were AF-related, with a median duration of hospital stay of four nights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of any hospitalization for AF [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.626 (0.546-0.719)] and duration of hospital stay were significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. placebo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> treatment reduced total hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (P = 0.0105) and the time between the first AF/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> recurrence and CV hospitalization/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = 0.0048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization burden was significantly reduced across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of care (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence data indicated that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> persisted for at least 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> reduced the risk for CV hospitalization and the total hospitalization burden in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The trial is registered under ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT 00174785 </plain></SENT>
