<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1990 to December 2005, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent tracheobronchial reconstructions with bronchoplastic closure for bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> involving the carina or tracheobronchial angle were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical data for patients were collected retrospectively, including demographic characteristics, occurrences of postoperative complications, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were eligible, including 23 who had right pneumonectomies, 6 who had right upper lobectomies, and 11 who had left pneumonectomies, associated with lower lateral wall of the trachea resections or with partial carinal resections for centrally localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The airway defects ranged from 0.5×2 cm to 2×4 cm and involved up to 50% of the airway circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> was found postoperatively at the bronchial margin in 20% (8/40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 40 patients, 2 (5.0%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>pulmonary atelectasis</z:hpo> develop, 2 (5.0%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 2 (5.0%) bronchopleural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, and 1 (2.5%) airway stenosis after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 2.5% (1/40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival for 40 patients was 18.5 months with a cumulative survival of 72.2%, 26.6%, and 21.3% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tracheobronchial reconstruction using bronchoplastic closure might be a reasonable option for closing massive central airway defects for advanced bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> involving the tracheobronchial angle or carina, avoiding tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy with limited excision of the lateral wall of the trachea or carina </plain></SENT>
