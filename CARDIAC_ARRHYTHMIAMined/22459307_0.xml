<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More importantly, high-level endurance training may promote right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the long-term consequences of marathon running on cardiac remodeling as a potential substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with a focus on the right heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We invited runners of the 2010 Grand Prix of Bern, a 10-mile race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 873 marathon and nonmarathon runners who applied, 122 (61 women) entered the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were stratified according to former marathon participations: control group (nonmarathon runners, n = 34), group 1 (1 marathon to 5 marathons, mean 2.7, n = 46), and group 2 (≥6 marathons, mean 12.8, n = 42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 42 ± 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were adjusted for gender, age, and lifetime training hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right and left atrial sizes increased with marathon participations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2, right and left atrial enlargements were present in 60% and 74% of athletes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RV and left ventricular (LV) dimensions showed no differences among groups, and RV or LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was present in only 2.4% or 4.3% of marathon runners, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multiple linear regression analysis, marathon participation was an independent predictor of right and left atrial sizes but had no effect on RV and LV dimensions and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Atrial and ventricular ectopic complexes during 24-hour Holter monitoring were low and equally distributed among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in nonelite athletes, marathon running was not associated with RV enlargement, dysfunction, or ventricular ectopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Marathon running promoted biatrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
