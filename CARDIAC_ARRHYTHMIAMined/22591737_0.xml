<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Maternal placental syndromes (MPS)-gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011419'>placental abruption</z:hpo>/infarction-are more prevalent in women with features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetSyn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both MPS and the MetSyn predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005162'>left ventricular impairment</z:hpo> and sympathetic dominance after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether this translates into a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and cardiac dysrhythmias is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of HF and dysrhythmias among women after a prior MPS-affected pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out of 1,130,764 individual women with a delivery in Ontario between 1992 and 2009, excluding those with cardiac or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> 1 year before delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of a composite outcome of a hospitalisation for HF or an atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia was compared in women with and without MPS, starting 1 year after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 75,242 individuals (6.7%) experienced a MPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median duration of 7.8 years, the composite outcome occurred in 148 women with MPS (2.54 per 10,000 person-years) and 1062 women without MPS (1.28 per 10,000 person-years) (crude HR=2.00, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at composite outcome was 37.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HR was 1.61 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.91) after adjustment for demographic characteristics, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510472" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug dependence</z:e> or tobacco use, as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> &gt;1 year after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The adjusted HRs were minimally reduced by further adjusting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1.51, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.80) and were higher in women with MPS plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm delivery</z:hpo> and poor fetal growth (2.42, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with MPS are at higher risk of premature HF and dysrhythmias, especially when perinatal morbidity is present </plain></SENT>
