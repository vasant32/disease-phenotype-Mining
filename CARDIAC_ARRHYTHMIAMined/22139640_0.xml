<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate percutaneous penetration and arrhythmogenic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> after transdermal administration, compared with the oral route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Skin penetration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> was tested by a microdialysis technique in rats and in vivo recovery was determined by retrodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After oral and transdermal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi>, dialysate was sampled at 20 min intervals until the end of the experiment for the determination of concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> in skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected and analyzed using a validated HPLC-MS/MS method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we concurrently recorded the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vivo recovery of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> in the skin was calculated to be 39.59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C(max) values for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> absorbed into the skin after oral and transdermal administration were 1.51 ± 0.53 and 2723.8 ± 848.8 ng/mL, respectively, and within the plasma, 215.86 ±���79.29 and 20.92 ± 3.15 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C(max) value for the plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> after oral administration was approximately 10 times higher than with the transdermal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For oral administration, the ECG revealed various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at a period of T(max) , which is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in transdermal gel administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that transdermal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> gel is a safe formulation that can deliver the drug in sufficient amounts and safe concentrations to produce therapeutic action in rats </plain></SENT>
