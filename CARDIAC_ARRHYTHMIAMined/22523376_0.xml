<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are increasingly recognized and associated with significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to describe the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring late after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with prior <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> who presented with late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> for electrophysiological studies (EPS) were identified at two cardiac transplant centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 859 patients, 16 (mean age 52 ± 14 years, 11 of 16 were men) patients underwent EPS for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> presenting 8.6 ± 5.7 years following <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 16 patients, 14 underwent cardiac alone and 2 included lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of cardiac rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were due to counterclockwise cavotricuspid-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) in 10 of 16, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) in 6 (1 patient had AFL and AT), and 1 due to atrioventricular nodal re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recipient-donor atrial electrical connection was seen in two of six AT and in no cases of AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases, a focal AT was mapped to the remnant atrium conducting 2 : 1 or at variable block to the donor atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In four cases a focal/micro re-entrant AT originated within the vicinity of the interatrial suture scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were successfully ablated with radiofrequency energy; however, one case of AFL required a repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients remained free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at 34 ± 15 months post-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Typical AFL and AT are the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring late following <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Focal ATs may originate in low-voltage or border zones immediately adjacent to the atrio-atrial anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation is an effective treatment strategy with high long-term success </plain></SENT>
