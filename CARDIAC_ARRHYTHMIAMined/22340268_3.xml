<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the use of an injectable hydrogel derived from ventricular extracellular matrix (ECM) for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and its ability to be delivered percutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Injectable materials offer promising alternatives to treat MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although most of the examined materials have shown preserved or improved cardiac function in small animal models, none have been specifically designed for the heart, and few have translated to catheter delivery in large animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have developed a myocardial-specific hydrogel, derived from decellularized ventricular ECM, which self-assembles when injected in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion followed by injection of the hydrogel or saline 2 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The implantation response was assessed via histology and immunohistochemistry, and the potential for arrhythmogenesis was examined using programmed electrical stimulation 1 week post-injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function was analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging 1 week pre-injection and 4 weeks <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a porcine model, we delivered the hydrogel using the NOGA-guided MyoStar catheter (Biologics Delivery Systems, Irwindale, California), and utilized histology to assess retention of the material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that injection of the material in the rat MI model increases endogenous cardiomyocytes in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area and maintains cardiac function without inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate feasibility of transendocardial catheter injection in a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first in situ gelling material to be delivered via transendocardial injection in a large animal model, a critical step towards the translation of injectable materials for treating MI in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results warrant further study of this material in a large animal model of MI and suggest this may be a promising new therapy for treating MI </plain></SENT>
