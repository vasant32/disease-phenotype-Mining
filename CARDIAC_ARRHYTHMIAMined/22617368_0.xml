<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the 9th consecutive year that the Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods (JPTM) has published themed issues arising from the annual meeting of the Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SPS is now past its 10th year as a distinct (from pharmacology to toxicology) discipline that integrates safety pharmacologists from industry with those in academia and the various global regulatory authorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The themes of the 2011 meeting were (i) the bridging of safety assessment of a new chemical entity (NCE) between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the parties involved, (ii) applied technologies and (iii) translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This issue of JPTM reflects these themes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The content is informed by the regulatory guidance documents (S7A and S7B) that apply prior to first in human (FIH) studies, which emphasize the importance of seeking model validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The manuscripts encompass a broad spectrum of safety pharmacology topics including application of state-of-the-art techniques for study conduct and data processing and evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This includes some exciting novel integrated core battery study designs, refinements in hemodynamic assessment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> analysis algorithms, and additionally an overview of safety immunopharmacology, and a brief survey discussing similarities and differences in business models that pharmaceutical companies employ in safety pharmacology, together with SPS recommendations on 'best practice' for the conduct of a non-clinical cardiovascular assessment of a NCE </plain></SENT>
