<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high sensitivity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> events is accompanied by reduced specificity resulting in inappropriate and unnecessary shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients may experience inappropriate shocks, which are most commonly caused by lead noise, oversensing of T-waves, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The new Protecta <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices have been designed to minimize inappropriate and unnecessary shocks through novel SmartShock(TM) technology algorithms targeting these causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PainFree SST study is a prospective, multicentre clinical trial, which will be conducted in two consecutive phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phase I will assess safety and any delay that may arise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection time using new algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phase II will evaluate reduction of inappropriate and unnecessary shocks at 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional objectives will include Quality of Life, healthcare utilization, safety of extending the ventricular tachyarrhythmia/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> interval detection duration (18 out of 24 vs. 30 out of 40 intervals), and reasons for inappropriate shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up to 2000 subjects in 150 centres worldwide will be enrolled with a follow-up of at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects enrolled in Phase I will continue in Phase II of the study and data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled subjects will contribute to the analysis of Phase II objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inappropriate and unnecessary shock delivery remains a significant clinical issue for patients receiving device therapies, which has considerable consequences for patients and the healthcare system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PainFree SST study will investigate the ability of new algorithms to reduce inappropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results from this study are expected in mid-2013 </plain></SENT>
