<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate the correlation between EED and incidence of breakthrough and to test the plausibility of transmural conduction versus ectopic focal discharges as sources of breakthrough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We analyzed high-resolution simultaneous endo-epicardial in vivo mapping data recorded in left atrial free walls of goats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF, 3 weeks and 6 months of AF (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Waves were analyzed for number, size, and width and categorized according to their origin outside (peripheral wave) or within the mapping area (breakthrough) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breakthrough incidence was lowest (2.1±1.0%) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF, higher (11.4±6.1%) after 3 weeks (P&lt;0.01 versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF) and highest (14.2±3.8%) after 6 months AF (P&lt;0.001 versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF) and similar in the epicardium and endocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the breakthroughs (86%; n=564) could be explained by transmural conduction, whereas only 13% (n=85) could be explained by ectopic focal discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transmural microreentry did not play a role as source of breakthrough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- This is the first study to present simultaneous endo-epicardial in vivo mapping data at sites of breakthrough events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Breakthrough incidence and degree of EED increased with increasing AF substrate complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In goat left atrial free walls, most of the breakthroughs can be explained by transmural conduction, whereas ectopic focal discharges play a limited role as source of breakthrough </plain></SENT>
