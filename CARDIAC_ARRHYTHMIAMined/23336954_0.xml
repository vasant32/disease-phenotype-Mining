<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG detects electrical potentials that are generated by cardiac electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to electrical potentials, the same electrical activity of the heart also induces magnetic fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These extremely weak cardiac magnetic signals are detected by a non-invasive, contactless technique called magnetocardiography (MCG), which has been evaluated in a number of clinical studies for its usefulness in diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
