<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Empiric slow pathway ablation (ESPA) is sometimes performed in patients with DAVNP without inducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> at the time of electrophysiological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence to guide this practice in the adult population is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to assess the practice of ESPA by adult electrophysiologists in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Canadian interventional electrophysiologists (n = 81) were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire assessing their practice of ESPA in patients with suspected and documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operator experience, reimbursement models, diagnostic, and treatment decisions regarding ESPA were assessed with case scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one responses (50 %) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-five percent of the responders stated that the evidence for ESPA is lacking or limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responders were more likely to perform ESPA in the setting of non-inducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> when there was documentation of the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (64 vs. 31 % (p = 0.017)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The threshold to perform ESPA was highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer time in practice (r = 0.38, p = 0.017) and less perceived complications with ESPA (r = 0.31, p = 0.05) were correlated with the practice of ESPA, whereas length of ablation waiting lists (r = -0.15, p = 0.38), number of procedures performed per day (r = 0.11, p = 0.51) and type of reimbursement (p = 0.24) were not associated with the practice of ESPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The perceived complication rate with ESPA was &lt;1 % </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Documentation of the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, operator experience, and perceived low complication rates positively influence this practice </plain></SENT>
