<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated developmental patterns of RSA in a sample of 163 5- to 14-year-old children, who were either at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (due to having a parent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e>) or low-risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that high-risk children have lower resting RSA than do low-risk children, which could reflect atypical developmental trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children's RSA was assessed during resting baseline periods on multiple occasions, typically 1-year apart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linear growth modeling indicated a group by age interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low-risk children (but not the high-risk children) exhibited a significantly increasing trajectory in resting RSA with age </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study provides new evidence that children at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> have an atypical developmental trajectory of RSA across late childhood </plain></SENT>
