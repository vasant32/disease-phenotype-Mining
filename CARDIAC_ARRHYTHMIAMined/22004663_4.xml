<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to define the prevalence of mutations in the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing protein RBM20 in a large cohort with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and to determine whether genetic variation in RBM20 is associated with clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included in the Genetic Risk Assessment of Defibrillator Events (GRADE) study were aged at least 18 years, had an ejection fraction of ≤30%, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The coding region and splice junctions of RBM20 were screened in subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>; 2 common polymorphisms in RBM20, rs942077 and rs35141404, were genotyped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GRADE subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1465 subjects were enrolled in the GRADE study, and 283 with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were screened for RBM20 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was 58 ± 13 years, 64% were males, and the mean follow-up time was 24.2 ± 17.1 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RBM20 mutations were identified in 8 subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers had a similar survival, transplantation rate, and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy compared with nonmutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 8 subjects with RBM20 mutations (37.5%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), whereas 19 subjects without mutations (7.4%) had AF (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GRADE subjects, rs35141404 was associated with AF (minor allele odds ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.44-0.86; P = .006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subset of GRADE subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, rs35141404 was associated with AF (minor allele odds ratio = 0.58; P = .047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in RBM20 were observed in approximately 3% of subjects with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in survival, transplantation rate, and frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
