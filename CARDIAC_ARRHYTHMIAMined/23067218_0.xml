<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pneumonectomy is associated with the increased risk of postoperative complications and higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Late results are affected by progressive deterioration of the quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some patients, especially with central location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> the sleeve lobectomy can be an alternative to pneumonectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there are some doubts about the higher risk of local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the early and late results of sleeve lobectomy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 107 patients subjected to surgery due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> between 2001 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 89 male and 18 female patients, aged between 35 and 78 years (mean age: 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery was preceded by routine diagnostic and staging procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was based on the Statistica 6.0 software.The following sleeve lobectomies were performed: 71 right upper, 29 left upper, 5 left lower lobectomies, one inferior bilobectomy and one upper bilobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were subjected to left upper sleeve lobectomy with partial resection and reconstruction of the pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>Squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) was the most common type of histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients were classified as stage IB and IIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Perioperative mortality in the entire study population was 1.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most frequent complications were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (11.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo> of the operated lung (10.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The five-year survival after surgery was 56.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was observed in 10 patients (9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrated that T stage and postoperative chemotherapy were significant factors influencing long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that T stage was the only factor influencing the long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sleeve lobectomy is a good alternative to pneumonectomy in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although it is considered as technically difficult, it is characterized by lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the perioperative period, lower percentage of significant postoperative complications and better quality of life after the operation </plain></SENT>
