<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Electrophysiologic and surgical procedures to treat stand-alone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) have recently evolved, but disappointing results in patients with long-standing persistent (LSP) AF have challenged the durability of these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lone AF patients (n = 36) with either LSP-AF (n = 28) or persistent AF (n = 8) were prospectively enrolled in the study and consecutively treated by thoracoscopic ablation followed by electrophysiologic evaluation 30 days afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean left atrial dimension was 50.3 ± 5.5 mm, and average AF duration was 72.8 months (range, 7-240 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The thoracoscopic procedure was a right monolateral approach to create a box lesion using a temperature-controlled radiofrequency device with suction adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A continuous rhythm monitoring device was implanted at the end of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thoracoscopic ablation was successfully completed without morbidity or mortality and without any intensive care unit stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative exit and entrance block was achieved in 100% and 88.8% (32/36) of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 33 ± 2 days after the operation, an electrophysiologic study confirmed entry-exit block in 83.3% (30/36) whereas pulmonary vein reconnections were observed in 16.7% (6/36) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional transcatheter lesions were performed in 61.1% (22/36) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-58 months), 91.6% (33/36) of patients are in sinus rhythm with 77.7% (28/36) of these patients off antiarrhythmic drugs and 88.8% (32/36) free of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term incidence of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a surgical box lesion and transcatheter ablation in a hybrid approach provided excellent durable clinical outcomes in patients with LSP-AF </plain></SENT>
