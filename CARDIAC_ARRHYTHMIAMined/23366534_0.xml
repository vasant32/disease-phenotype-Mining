<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The algorithm is able to automatically switch between single-channel and multi-channel analysis mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study includes data from 11 patients measured with the DELTA ePatch platform and the algorithm achieves an average QRS sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.57% and 99.57%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The algorithm was also evaluated on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 48 records from the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database (MITDB) with an average sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.63% and 99.63%, respectively </plain></SENT>
