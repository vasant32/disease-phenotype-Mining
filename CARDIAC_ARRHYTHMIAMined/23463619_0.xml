<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their functional roles in embryonic heart remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using patch clamp, Ca(2+) imaging, and RT-PCR, we found that I(f) regulated the firing rate in early and late stage embryonic ventricular cells, as ivabradine (30 µM), a specific blocker of I(f), slowed down action potential (AP) frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect was even stronger in late stage cells, though I(f) was down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to I(f), ICR was found to be indispensable for the occurrence of APs in ventricular cells of different stages, because abolishment of ICR with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi> (2-APB), specific blockers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors (RyRs) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), completely abolished APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we noticed that RyR- and IP3R mediated ICR coexisted in early-stage ventricular cells and RyRs functionally dominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While at late stage RyRs, but not IP3Rs, mediated ICR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both early and late stage ventricular cells, Na-Ca exchanger current (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>/Ca ) mediated ICR-triggered depolarization of membrane potential and resulted in the initiation of APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed that different from I(f), which presented as the substantial component of the earlier diastolic depolarization current, application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> and/or 2-APB slowed the late phase of diastolic depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus we conclude that in murine embryonic ventricular cells I(f) regulates firing rate, while RyRs and IP3Rs (early stage) or RyRs (late stage) mediated ICR determines the occurrence of APs </plain></SENT>
