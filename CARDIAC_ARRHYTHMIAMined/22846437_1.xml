<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ceaseless opening and closing of the voltage-gated channels (VGCs) underlying cardiac rhythmicity is controlled, in each VGC, by four mobile voltage sensors embedded in bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Every action potential necessitates extensive packing/repacking of voltage sensor domains with adjacent interacting <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This renders VGC activity mechanosensitive (MS), i.e., energetically sensitive to the bilayer's mechanical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Irreversible perturbations of sarcolemmal bilayer such as those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, reperfusion, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, cortical-cytoskeleton abnormalities, bilayer-disrupting toxins, diet aberrations, etc, should therefore perturb VGC activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disordered/fluidized bilayer states that facilitate voltage sensor repacking, and thus make VGC opening too easy could, therefore, explain VGC-leakiness in these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study this in membrane patches we impose mechanical blebbing injury during pipette <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>-induced membrane stretch, a process that modulates VGC activity irreversibly (plastic regime) and then, eventually, reversibly (elastic regime) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of differences in sensor-to-gate coupling among different VGCs, their responses to stretch fall into two major categories, MS-Speed, MS-Number, exemplified by Nav and Cav channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For particular VGCs in perturbed bilayers, leak mechanisms depend on whether or not the rate-limiting voltage-dependent step is MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mode-switch transitions might also be mechanosensitive and thus play a role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incorporated mathematically in axon models, plastic-regime Nav responses elicit ectopic firing behaviors typical of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cardiomyocytes with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> damage, Nav and/or Cav leaks from irreversible MS modulation (MS-Speed, MS-Number, respectively) could, similarly, foster ectopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Where pathologically leaky VGCs reside in damaged bilayer, peri-channel bilayer disorder/fluidity conditions could be an important "target feature" for anti-arrhythmic VGC drugs </plain></SENT>
