<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A linear relationship between concentration and QTcF described the data from five clinical trials in patients on <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> maintenance treatment (MMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previously published population PK model adequately described the concentration-time data, and this model was used for simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QTcF was increased by a mean (90% confidence interval (CI)) of 17 (12, 22) ms per 1,000 ng/ml of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on this model, doses &gt;120 mg/day would increase the QTcF interval by &gt;20 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model predicts that 1-3% of patients would have Î”QTcF &gt;60 ms, and 0.3-2.0% of patients would have QTcF &gt;500 ms at doses of 160-200 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our predictions are consistent with available observational data and support the need for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk factor assessment in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> doses &gt;120 mg/day </plain></SENT>
