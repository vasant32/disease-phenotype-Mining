<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Means for distinguishing the very common "benign early repolarization" from the very rare but malignant form are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the presence of early repolarization with "horizontal ST segment" was found to predict arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during long-term follow-up in a large population study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore speculated that the combination of "J waves with horizontal ST segment" would correlate with a history of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) better than the mere presence of J waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the ST segment adds diagnostic value to the mere presence of J waves in a case-control series of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reanalyzed our case-control study showing that the presence of J waves strongly correlates with a history of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> among 45 patients with this disorder, 124 controls matched for age and gender ("matched-control" group), and 121 young athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This time we focused only on those patients with J waves and graded their ST-segment <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> as either "horizontal" or "ascending" according to predefined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of J waves was associated with a history of idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> with an odds ratio of 4.0 (95% confidence intervals = 2.0-7.9), but having both J waves and horizontal ST segment yielded an odds ratio of 13.8 (95% confidence intervals = 5.1-37.2) for having idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report, for the first time, that the combination of J waves with horizontal/descending ST segment improved our ability to distinguish patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> from controls matched by gender and age </plain></SENT>
