<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The effectiveness of short-term 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) therapy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002930'>thyroid hormone resistance</z:hpo> (RTH) has been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a 3-year course of TRIAC therapy in an RTH boy, with quantitative evaluation of the therapeutic effects and pharmacological study of TRIAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient findings: The gene encoding the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) of the patient carries a P453T mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During treatment with up to 3.0 mg TRIAC per day, reduction in thyroid volume, resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and decrease in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> (FT4) levels were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) symptoms improved, with a concomitant decline in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> Rating Scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary: A TRIAC pharmacokinetic study, conducted using triiodothyronine (T3) level as a surrogate for TRIAC level, demonstrated that TRIAC disappears from the circulation rapidly and has a shorter duration of TSH-secretion inhibitory effect in the RTH patient compared to that in the control subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies of TSH and FT4 levels over a period of 3 years indicated that the TRIAC effect is dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: TRIAC was effective and safe in ameliorating the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> symptoms in a child with known genetic RTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, it was demonstrated that TRIAC has a short half-life and functions dose-dependently </plain></SENT>
