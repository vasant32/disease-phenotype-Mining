<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To collect information on the use of the Reveal implantable loop recorder (ILR) in the patient care pathway and to investigate its effectiveness in the diagnosis of unexplained recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in everyday clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in 2006-2009 in 10 European countries and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had recurrent unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects received a Reveal Plus, DX or XT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow up was until the first recurrence of a syncopal event leading to a diagnosis or for ≥1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the course of the study, patients were evaluated by an average of three different specialists for management of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and underwent a median of 13 tests (range 9-20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant physical trauma had been experienced in association with a syncopal episode by 36% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up time after ILR implant was 10±6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up visit data were available for 570 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of patients with recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> were 19, 26, and 36% after 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 218 events within the study, ILR-guided diagnosis was obtained in 170 cases (78%), of which 128 (75%) were cardiac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A large number of diagnostic tests were undertaken in patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> without providing conclusive data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ILR revealed or contributed to establishing the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in the vast majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings support the recommendation in current guidelines that an ILR should be implanted early rather than late in the evaluation of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
