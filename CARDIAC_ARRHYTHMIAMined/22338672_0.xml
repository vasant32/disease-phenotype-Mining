<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although QT prolongation following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) is generally moderate, cases with marked QT prolongation leading to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic substrate of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 13 patients who developed TdP in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of MI (2-11 days) and a group of 133 ethnically matched controls with uncomplicated MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long QT syndrome</z:hpo> genes and the KCNH2-K897T polymorphism were screened by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography plus direct sequencing and a specific TaqMan assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the 13 patients (15%) who presented with QT prolongation and TdP were found to carry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> mutations (KCNH2-R744X and SCN5A-E446K) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of the remaining 11 patients (82%) carried the KCNH2-K897T polymorphism, which was present in 35% of the controls (P = .0035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI carrying the KCNH2-K897T polymorphism had an 8-fold greater risk of experiencing TdP compared with controls (95% confidence interval = 2-40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the common K897T polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of TdP developing in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the concept that the electrical remodeling associated with this healing phase of MI may unmask a genetic substrate predisposing to a time-limited development of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also provide the first line of evidence in support of the hypothesis that a common polymorphism, previously described as a modifier of the severity of LQTS, may increase the risk of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a much more prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
