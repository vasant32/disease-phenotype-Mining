<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Heart repair by stem cell treatment may involve life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) appear best suited for reconstituting lost myocardium without posing arrhythmic risks, being commissioned towards cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we tested the hypothesis that mobilization of CPCs through locally delivered Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 to heal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), lowers the proneness to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used 133 adult male Wistar rats either with one-month old MI and treated with growth factors (GFs, n = 60) or vehicle (V, n = 55), or sham operated (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In selected groups of animals, prior to and two weeks after GF/V delivery, we evaluated stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> by telemetry-ECG, cardiac mechanics by echocardiography, and ventricular excitability, conduction velocity and refractoriness by epicardial multiple-lead recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Invasive hemodynamic measurements were performed before sacrifice and eventually the hearts were subjected to anatomical, morphometric, immunohistochemical, and molecular biology analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When compared with untreated MI, GFs decreased stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and concurrently prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) without affecting neither the duration of ventricular repolarization, as suggested by measurements of QTc interval and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for K-channel α-subunits Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, nor the dispersion of refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, markers of cardiomyocyte reactive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, including <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for K-channel α-subunit Kv1.4 and β-subunit KChIP2, interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and negative structural remodeling were significantly reduced in peri-infarcted/remote ventricular myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, analyses of BrdU incorporation and distribution of connexin43 and N-cadherin indicated that cytokines generated new vessels and electromechanically-connected myocytes and abolished the correlation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size with deterioration of mechanical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, local injection of GFs ameliorates electromechanical competence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reduced arrhythmogenesis is attributable to prolongation of ERP resulting from improved intercellular coupling via increased expression of connexin43, and attenuation of unfavorable remodeling </plain></SENT>
