<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbations of cardiac conduction have been associated with congenital and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of conduction depends on the regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> gene expression by key transcription factors and transcriptional enhancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the genome-wide occupation of conduction system-regulating transcription factors TBX3, NKX2-5, and GATA4 and of enhancer-associated coactivator p300 in the mouse heart, uncovering cardiac enhancers throughout the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many of the enhancers colocalized with ion channel genes repressed by TBX3, including the clustered <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel genes Scn5a, essential for cardiac function, and Scn10a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 2 enhancers in the Scn5a/Scn10a locus, which were regulated by TBX3 and its family member and activator, TBX5, and are functionally conserved in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also provided evidence that a SNP in the SCN10A enhancer associated with alterations in cardiac conduction patterns in humans disrupts TBX3/TBX5 binding and reduces the cardiac activity of the enhancer in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the identification of key regulatory elements for cardiac conduction helps to explain how genetic variants in noncoding regulatory DNA sequences influence the regulation of cardiac conduction and the predisposition for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
