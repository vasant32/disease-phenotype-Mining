<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In some patients with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004763'>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (PSVT), who are candidates for radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation, attempts for the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the electrophysiological study (EPS) fail despite different stimulation protocols even during the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of an atrial-His interval (AH) jump during decremental pre-mature atrial stimulation is the only clue for slow pathway ablation in these patients; in occasional patients, however, the AH jump is an accidental finding and the real <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is not atrioventricularnodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to introduce a new method for the induction of AVNRT in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients (50% male, mean age=44.40 ± 12.80 years) with clinical PSVT who were referred to our department for the EPS and RF catheter ablation were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had documented clinical PSVT with non-inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the EPS with different stimulation protocols even during the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> injection but they only showed an AH jump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To induce AVNRT, low-watt (15-20), low-temperature (40-45°C) RF currents were delivered into the slow pathway area for a maximum of 40 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricularnodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was inducible in five cases (50%, three male, mean age=45.80 ± 9.65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induction of AVNRT occurred either during the RF current application after the occurrence of junctional ectopic beats or after another stimulation protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A low-watt, low-temperature RF current application into the slow pathway area can be a provocative method for the induction of AVNRT probably by AV-junction warming and conduction-velocity augmentation </plain></SENT>
