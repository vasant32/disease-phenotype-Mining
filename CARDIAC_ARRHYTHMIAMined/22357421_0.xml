<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Published data concerning risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in WPW patients are inconsistent or contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 1007 patient (pts) (mean age 35years; 45% female) with an accessory pathway (AP) referred for non pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 56 pts (42M, aged 34±15yrs) with an AP and documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and Group 2-951 pts (513M, aged 35±15yrs) with an AP and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were: overt pre-excitation, male gender, multiple AP, large AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors were: overt pre-excitation, male gender and MAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean shortest pre-excited RR interval during AF was significantly shorter in Group 1: 205±27 vs. 243±64, P=0.019 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> as an end point of the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episode (AVRT or AF) was observed in 20 pts (15M, 5F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (no documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prior to aborted SCD) occurred in 16 pts (13M, 3F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> pts was significantly lower than of pts with history of AVRT or AVRT and/or AF (24.5 vs. 36.5 vs. 38yrs., P&lt;0.005 and P=0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> occurrence shows a bi-modal distribution with peak occurrences in the 2-nd/3-rd and 5-th decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with an accessory pathway, overt pre-excitation, male gender and multiple AP constitute independent risk factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Young patients in the 2-nd/3-rd and older patients in the 5-th decade might be at higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> occurrence </plain></SENT>
