<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rac1 activation in podocytes has been shown in several models of proteinuric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> and a concept involving motile podocytes has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence also exists for a critical role of Rac1-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> concentrations are not always increased in these conditions and the mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor overactivation are difficult to determine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using knockout mice, we identified a novel mechanism of Rac1-mediated podocyte impairment; Rac1 potentiates the activity of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor, thereby accelerating podocyte injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We subsequently demonstrated that the Rac1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor pathway contributes to ligand-independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor activation in several animal models of kidney and cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperkalaemia is a major concern associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>; however, agents that modulate the activity of the Rac1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor pathway in target cells, such as cell-type-specific Rac inhibitors and selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi>-receptor modulators, could potentially be novel therapeutic candidates with high efficacy and a low risk of adverse effects in patients with renal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
