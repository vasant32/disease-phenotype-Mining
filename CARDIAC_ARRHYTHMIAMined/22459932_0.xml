<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Five thousand nine hundred ninety-eight patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: An evaluation of RWMAs recorded with intraoperative TEE before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients who had coronary angiography for suspected postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> based on electrocardiogram (ECG), CK-MB, troponin T, hemodynamic compromise, low cardiac output, and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, and chi-square analysis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (0.7%) underwent early coronary angiography for the suspicion of early graft dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 patients with diagnosed early graft dysfunction, 5 patients (15.6%) had shown new intraoperative RWMAs as detected by TEE, 21 patients (65.6%) had no new RWMAs, no report was available in 5 patients (15.6%), and 1 examination (3.1%) was excluded because of poor imaging quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of TEE to predict graft failure was 15.6%, the specificity was 57.1%, and the positive predictive and negative values were 62.5% and 12.9%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was 0.1190 (0.0099-1.4257) when TEE was positive compared with coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was found between new RWMAs detected with TEE and graft failure as documented with coronary angiography (p = 0.106) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, RWMAs detected with TEE were of limited value to predict early postoperative CABG failure </plain></SENT>
