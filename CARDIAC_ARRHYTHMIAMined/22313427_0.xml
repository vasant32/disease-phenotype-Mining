<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, this has been reported in four Asian patients with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a Caucasian woman who developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011945'>bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOOP</z:e>)-like interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> after PTU administration for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT FINDINGS: The patient was a 68-year-old woman who had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> starting in May 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had been a heavy smoker with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> but no dust exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In October 2006, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was stopped after she developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In January 2007 serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.01 mIU/L (0.35-4.94) and free T4 was 17.5 pg/mL (7 to 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She was initially started on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> and then changed to PTU after she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000989'>pruritus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> 9 months after starting PTU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time she was also taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, enalapril, and sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray showed diffuse interstitial peripheral opacities and transbronchial lung biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> lung injury with organizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the alveolar type 2 pneumocytes, and characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOOP</z:e>-like interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Signs and symptoms progressively improved after PTU discontinuation as confirmed at X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and by respiratory function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>She has been recurrence free for 4 years after stopping PTU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: This woman of Caucasian ancestral origin developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOOP</z:e>-like interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> after PTU treatment for apparent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e>, with resolution of her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung disease</z:e> after stopping PTU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Tests for TSH receptor antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and antinuclear cytoplasmic autoantibody were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thyroid ultrasound was consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> without nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PTU-associated interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> is not limited to patients of Asian origin or those with autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PTU must be withdrawn in the presence of respiratory symptoms and documented interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>X-ray films, CT-scan, respiratory function tests, and lung biopsy are needed to diagnose PTU-induced interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> with certainty and to monitor the evolution of the disease after PTU discontinuation </plain></SENT>
