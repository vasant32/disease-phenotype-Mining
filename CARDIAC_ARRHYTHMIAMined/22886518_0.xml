<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the great potential of these initiatives to improve the quality of health care and patient outcomes, the average clinician has not been engaged in or educated about these initiatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true of specialists like electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given that participation in these initiatives will become mandatory in the next few years, it is critically important to prepare our community for these programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To that end, electrophysiologists should be educated about the potential strengths and pitfalls of these quality improvement programs, and they should be engaged more effectively in the development and testing of such programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, electrophysiologists face unique challenges that deserve attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of these challenges relate to the scarcity of performance measures that are specific to heart rhythm care and the scarcity of registries that could be used for performance measures and public reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This article provides an overview of performance measures and public reporting, the role of registries in quality improvement, and appropriate use criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It then concludes with recommendations regarding the proper implementation of these quality improvement initiatives to ensure a high likelihood of success </plain></SENT>
