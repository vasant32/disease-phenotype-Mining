<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the potential of an asymmetric collimation technique to reduce dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For 30 patients, referred for AF ablation, we determined the received fluoroscopy dose for various collimation scenarios: a single collimation window encompassing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> veins as used in most labs (Sc 1), an optimal adjusted symmetric collimation window encompassing each two ipsilateral veins (Sc 2) or each individual vein (Sc 3) and an optimal asymmetric collimation window encompassing each two ipsilateral veins (Sc 4) or each individual vein (Sc 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were studied retrospectively and 10 were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total fluoroscopy effective dose for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> collimation strategies amounted to 45 ± 31 mSv for a single collimation field (Sc 1), 36 ± 25 mSv (Sc 2), and 24 ± 14 mSv (Sc 3) for a symmetrically adjusted collimation window and 15 ± 10 (Sc 4) and 5 ± 3 mSv (Sc 5) for an asymmetrically adjusted collimation approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validation of symmetric (Sc 2) and asymmetric (Sc 4) collimation in 10 patients confirmed the retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and effective application of an optimal asymmetric collimation approach would yield an average three- to nine-fold reduction of fluoroscopy dose during AF ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This reduction exceeds what has been previously reported by implementing an electromagnetic catheter tracking approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it can be easily integrated in the clinical workflow with limited additional one-time cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Manufacturers of imaging systems should consider its implementation a priority, and physicians should adopt it in their workflow </plain></SENT>
