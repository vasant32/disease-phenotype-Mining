<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> is the most efficacious anti-arrhythmic agent; however, its use is limited due to an unfavourable safety profile, including pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, thyroid, liver, skin and pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi>, which is structurally similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, was developed to try and achieve a favourable balance of efficacy and risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> has been evaluated in several large clinical trials, which have shown reduced mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with non-permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with permanent AF and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> has been shown to cause increased mortality and morbidity and should not be used in these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> has fewer toxic effects (thyroid, skin, pulmonary) and, although less efficacious, may be used as first-line therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with non-permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinicians must be vigilant in monitoring their patients to ensure they do not develop permanent AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
