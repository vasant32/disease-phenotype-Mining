<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of fifteen animals were used, out of which ten underwent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to induce infarction (7-35% area) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) evolved and stabilized during a three month-period, after which, rabbits were sacrificed and the injured area was histologically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right before sacrifice, ECGs were obtained to correlate several of its parameters to the infarcted mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter was normalized after combining data from planimetry measurements and heart weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following ECG parameters were studied: RR and PR intervals, P-wave duration (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), QRS duration (QRSD) and amplitude (QRSA), Q-wave (QA), R-wave (RA) and S-wave (SA) amplitudes, T-wave peak amplitude (TA), the interval from the peak to the end of the T-wave (TPE), ST-segment deviation (STA), QT interval (QT), corrected QT and JT intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corrected QT was analyzed with different correction formulae, i.e., Bazett (QTB), Framingham (QTFRA), Fridericia (QTFRI), Hodge (QTHO) and Matsunaga (QTMA) and compared thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The former variables and infarcted ventricular mass were then fitted to the allometric equation in terms of deviation from normality, in turn derived after ECGs in 5 healthy rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six variables (JT, QTB, QA, SA, TA and STA) presented statistical differences among leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QT showed the best allometric fit (r = 0.78), followed by TA (r = 0.77), STA (r = 0.75), QTFRA (r = 0.72), TPE (r = 0.69), QTFRI (r = 0.68) and QTMA (r = 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Corrected QT's (QTFRA, QTFRI and QTMA) performed worse than the uncorrected counterpart (QT), the former scaling allometrically with similar goodness of fits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: QT, TA, STA and TPE could possibly be used to assess infarction extent in an old MI event through the allometric model as a first approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the TPE also produced a good allometric scaling, leading to the potential existence of promising allometric indexes to diagnose malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
