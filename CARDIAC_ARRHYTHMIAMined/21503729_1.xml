<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapid 3D reconstruction of the left atrium (LA) can be obtained using multielectrode catheters in conjunction with electro-anatomical mapping (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e>) and can also be used to guide ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of electro-anatomical left atrial maps acquired with the multispine catheter by comparing them to CT and MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients undergoing ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preprocedural CT/MRI imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3D reconstructions of the LA were obtained using a multispine catheter with the Ensite/NavX mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operator was blinded to the results of the preprocedural imaging studies while acquiring the LA maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean map acquisition time was 10.3 ± 3.0 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between maximum pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) ostial length and intervein distances measured on the electro-anatomical maps and on the CT/MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 11 patients had right middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> which were detected during map acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six out of nine (67%) early branches of the right inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and three out of three (100%) early branches of right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> were also identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two patients, one branch of the left superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and one branch of the left inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> were not detected during mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left atrial anatomical maps acquired using multielectrode catheters in conjunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e> are accurate and provide information regarding pulmonary vein dimensions and geometry which is similar to that obtained with CT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
