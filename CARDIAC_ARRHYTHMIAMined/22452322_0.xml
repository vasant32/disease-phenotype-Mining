<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although idiopathic left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (ILVT) has been shown to possess a slow conduction zone (SCZ), the details of the electrophysiological and anatomic aspects are still not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the SCZ can be identified using a 3-dimensional electroanatomic (EA) mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with ILVT were mapped using a 3-dimensional electroanatomic (EA) mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 3-dimensional endocardial geometry of the left ventricular was created, the conduction system with left Purkinje potential (PP) and the SCZ with diastolic potential (DP) in LV were mapped during sinus rhythm (SR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and were tagged as special landmarks in the geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological and anatomic aspects of it were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EA mapping during SR and VT was successfully performed in 7 patients, during VT in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SCZ with DPs located at the inferoposterior septum was found in 7 patients during SR and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The length of the SCZ was 25.2 ± 2.3 mm with conduction velocity 0.08 ± 0.01 m/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in these parameters were found between patients during SR and VT (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An area with PP was found within the posterior septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A crossover junction area with DP and PP was found in 7 patients during SR and VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This area with DP and PP during SR coincided or were in proximity to such area during VT and radiofrequency ablation targeting the site within the area abolished VT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ILVT substrate within the junction area of the SCZ and the posterior fascicular can be identified and can be used to guide the ablation of ILVT </plain></SENT>
