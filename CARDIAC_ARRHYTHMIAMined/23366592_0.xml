<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The algorithm uses one equation with two different window widths to generate a feature signal and a detection threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This enables it to adapt to various changes in QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and noise levels, resulting in a detection error rate of just 0.29% on the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The algorithm is also computationally efficient and capable of resolving differences between multiple leads by automatically attaching a confidence value to each QRS detection </plain></SENT>
