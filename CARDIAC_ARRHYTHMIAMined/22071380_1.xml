<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-lead VDD (n= 166) and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> (n= 254) PMs were implanted in 420 successive patients with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> between January 2001 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period [median 25 (1-141) months], there was no difference in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> [11.2% in the VDD group; 11.4% in the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> group (P= 0.95)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [31.1% in the VDD group; 25.2% in the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> group (P= 0.20)], or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> [9.9% in the VDD group; 8.9% in the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> group (P= 0.74)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, 65.9% of the VDD PMs and 89.3% of the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> PMs were still programmed in their original mode with good atrial sensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 7.9% patients out of the VDD group had been switched to VVIR mode and 8.7% patients out of the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> group to VVIR or DDIR mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The P-wave amplitude was poor (sensed P-wave &lt;0.5 mV) in 19.1% of the VDD PM and 1.6% of the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> PM (P&lt; 0.001) and 7.1% of the VDD patients and 0.4% of the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> patients had been switched to VVIR pacing mode due to P-wave undersensing and AV dissociation (P= 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic atrial undersensing requiring upgrading was similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall survival, adjusted for age, was not significantly different in the VDD and the <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> group (log rank: 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Cox survival analysis excluded the pacing mode as a significant predictor of mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79, confidence interval (CI) (0.46-1.35), P= 0.39] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Comparing VDD and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacing, a significantly larger number of VDD-paced patients developed poor atrial signal detection without clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, atrial under sensing did not influence the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, or mortality </plain></SENT>
