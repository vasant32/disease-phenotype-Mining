<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate safety, efficacy, and outcome of direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are increasingly noted in adults with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome of DCCV for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this population is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study was a retrospective review of patients 18 years or older with CHD who underwent DCCV between June 2000 and July 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This constituted the CHD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics reviewed included the specific cardiac diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subset of patients had transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before DCCV; this subset was reviewed to evaluate spontaneous echocardiographic contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The outcome data evaluated included success of DCCV, complications, recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, antiarrhythmic medication use, electrophysiology or pacemaker procedure in follow-up, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was compared to a control group consisting of an age, gender, and rhythm matched group of patients who have no CHD and who underwent DCCV for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-three patients in the CHD group underwent 80 DCCVs, 59 of which were TEE-guided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>Atrial flutter</z:hpo> was more common in the CHD group (37 of 80 DCCV, 46%) than in the control group (13 of 56, 23%) (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DCCV was successful in 75 (94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 387 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality on follow-up was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to DCCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients in the CHD group (40%) remained in sinus rhythm throughout follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This was similar to that observed in the control group (30/56, 54%, p=0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the CHD group was predicted by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (p=0.009) and less so spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium (p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DCCV with appropriate anticoagulation is safe and effective for patients with CHD, even in the presence of an intracardiac shunt and spontaneous contrast on TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the recurrence rate is substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> predicts <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence following DCCV in patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
