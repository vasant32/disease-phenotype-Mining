<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have showed that fragmented QRS complexes (f - QRS, defined as different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16385">RSR</z:chebi>' patterns) on a routine 12 - lead electrocardiogram were associated with increased mortality and arrhythmic events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, but relatively little data were available regarding idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between fragmentation of QRS and the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, EF ≤ 40%) were analyzed, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to QRS duration and the existence of f - QRS on 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG), the study populations were divided into three groups: (1) the f - QRS group (QRS &lt;120 ms and with fragmented QRS, n = 51), (2) the wide QRS (wQRS) group (QRS ≥ 120 ms, n = 48), and (3) the nonfragmented QRS (non-<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp>) group (QRS &lt; 120 ms and without f - QRS, n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 14 ± 5 months, 25 (19.5%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and ventricular arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and ventricular tachyarrhythmias was significantly higher in the f - QRS and wQRS groups than the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group (23.5%, 25%, and 3.4%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Event-free was significantly decreased in the f - QRS group versus the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fQRS</z:mp> group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univaritae regression analysis revealed that f - QRS was a stronger predictor of mortality and arrhythmic events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: f - QRS on 12-lead ECG has a high predictive value for the combined end point of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and ventricular tachyarrhythmias in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
