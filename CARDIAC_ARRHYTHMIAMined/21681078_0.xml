<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100607'>dysmenorrhea</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), which is characterized by painful menstrual cycles, is one of the common clinical problems in young adult women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients by using the electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and 30 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECGs were performed by using 12-leads with 10 mV amplitude and 25 mm/sec velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P and QT waves were manually marked along the isoelectric line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P maximum, P minimum, QT maximum and QT minimum were measured on the surface 12-leads ECG, and the P wave and QT dispersions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was not any significant correlation of P wave dispersion and QT dispersion between the age, sex, body mass index, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or any other laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion was significantly longer in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> group than the control group (61.4 ± 19 msec versus 57 ± 14 msec, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The P minimum duration was significantly shorter in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> group compared with the control group (36 ± 16 msec versus 41 ± 9 msec, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion was significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> group compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (76 ± 23 msec versus 58 ± 16 msec, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> can be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, by increasing P wave dispersion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk because of an <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>increased QT interval</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
