<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> images quantitatively and qualitatively between non-enhanced and enhanced images (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Procedural parameters and clinical outcomes were compared between catheter ablation for AF referring solely to non-enhanced MDCT in CKD patients (n = 20) and using enhanced MDCT images integrated with electroanatomic mapping in non-CKD patients (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In gross <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, complete agreement was obtained between non-enhanced and enhanced MDCT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman plots and cumulative coefficient variation showed good agreement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> diameter determination between non-enhanced and enhanced MDCT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in procedural or fluoroscopic times between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation only referring to non-enhanced MDCT images and that using enhanced MDCT images integrated with electroanatomic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the ablation success rate and AF-free status at 3 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation referring only to non-enhanced MDCT images and that using an electroanatomic integration system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation with or without enhanced MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-enhanced MDCT provides adequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> image quality both quantitatively and qualitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that catheter ablation referring solely to non-enhanced MDCT images for AF could be performed with clinically acceptable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings warrant further studies involving a much larger number of patients to confirm the present results </plain></SENT>
