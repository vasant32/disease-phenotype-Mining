<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure relative employer-sponsored postablation costs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (CA), specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Regression-Controlled Employee/Spouse Database study (2001 to 2008) comparing CA patients with and without ablation and AF patients with and without ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regression-adjusted monthly medical, pharmacy, sick leave, and short-term disability costs were calculated 11 months before index to 36 months after index (first ablation date or average date for nonablation patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative pre/postindex comparisons between ablation and nonablation cohorts were calculated and time until ablation procedure cost recovery extrapolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Few CA (280 of 11,291; 2.48%) and AF (93 of 3062; 3.04%) patients received ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ablation cohorts cost less than nonablation cohorts postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimated total ablation-period costs were recovered 38 to 50 months postablation, including employee absence payment recovery within 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current ablation use in employer-sponsored health plans may improve health care and absence costs over time </plain></SENT>
