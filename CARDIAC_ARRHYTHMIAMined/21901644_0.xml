<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate CFR by assessing blood flow in the coronary sinus and systemic endothelial function measured by FMD of the brachial artery in an open prospective study of 10 control subjects and 10 patients (ages, 15-25 years) who have undergone surgical TOF repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> have been proposed as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> after surgical repair of TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of this may be related to impaired myocardial perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 3.0T GE Signa Excite scanner was used to achieve phase-contrast, velocity-encoding cine magnetic resonance imaging in the coronary sinus before and during infusion with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (0.14 mg/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FMD was measured in the brachial artery before <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and 5 min afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TOF group demonstrated significantly higher volumetric blood flow in the coronary sinus (282 ± 63 ml/min) than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects at rest (184 ± 57 ml/min) (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> infusion, this difference disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CFR was 2.00 ± 0.43 in the control group and 1.19 ± 0.34 in the TOF group (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation between FMD and CFR was observed in the study group (r (s) = 0.61, n = 8, P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study showed a reduced CFR due to a higher blood flow of the subject at rest in the TOF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This reduced CFR may disable a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adaptation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">increased oxygen demand</z:e> during exercise and increase myocardial vulnerability to reduced blood supply postoperatively for TOF patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
