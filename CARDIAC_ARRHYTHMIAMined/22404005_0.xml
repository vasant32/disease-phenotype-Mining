<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the frequency domain and time domain methods, the effects of respiratory rate on RSA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A general tendency increase features the three parameters of RSA as respiratory rate decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RSA represents the reflection control of respiratory system to cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the function of the reflection control of respiratory system to cardiovascular system increaseed with guided breathing decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conclusion indicates that the cardiovascular system could be improved by regulating the mode of respiration </plain></SENT>
