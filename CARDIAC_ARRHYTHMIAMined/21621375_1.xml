<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The protein MOG1 is a cofactor of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, Nav1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of MOG1 in Nav1.5-expressing cells increases <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the genes encoding Nav1.5 and its accessory proteins have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> of significant clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate whether MOG1 is implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a genetic screening of the MOG1-encoding gene (gene symbol RANGRF, alias MOG1) in 220 Danish patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 220, 197 were young patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and 23 were patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of one variant was investigated functionally by patch-clamping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-K1 cells coexpressing Nav1.5 with MOG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We uncovered a novel heterozygous nonsense variant, c.181G&gt;T (p.E61X), that, however, was also present in control subjects, albeit at a lower frequency (1.8% vs 0.4%, P = 0.078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological investigation showed that the p.E61X variant completely eliminates the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current-increasing effect of MOG1 and thereby causes loss of function in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When mimicking heterozygosity by coexpression of Nav1.5 with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> MOG1 and p.E61X-MOG1, no current decrease was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our screening of Nav1.5 cofactor MOG1 uncovered a novel nonsense variant that appeared to be present at a higher frequency among patients than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This variant causes MOG1 loss of function and therefore might be disease causing or modifying under certain conditions </plain></SENT>
