<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether loss of pace capture (PC) with high-output unipolar and/or bipolar pacing predicts the formation of uniform transmural lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten juvenile swine were anaesthetized and prepped under <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven isolated radiofrequency applications (RFAs) using a 3.5 mm tip-irrigated catheter were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pace capture was assessed before and after RFA at 10 mA/2 ms and catheter stability verified with a three-dimensional mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pace capture was defined as 1 : 1 or intermittent local capture per paced beat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myocardial contact and catheter orientation were assessed using intracardiac echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endocardial and epicardial lesion areas were measured after sacrifice using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A uniform transmural lesion was defined as an epicardial-to-endocardial surface ratio (epi/endo) ≥ 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four per cent of lesions were transmural and 55.8% of lesions had an epi/endo ratio ≥ 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 79.2% of lesions associated with loss of bipolar PC were uniform whereas 20.8% of lesions with loss of bipolar PC were non-uniform (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Loss of bipolar PC was associated with higher mean epicardial/endocardial ratio compared with lesions with persistent PC (P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic evidence of optimal catheter contact during RFA improved the predictive accuracy of uniform lesion formation when loss of bipolar PC was noted after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Loss of bipolar PC after RFA is associated with the formation of uniform lesions in atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Optimal catheter contact further improves the predictive accuracy associated with loss of PC </plain></SENT>
