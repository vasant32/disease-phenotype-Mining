<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 3012 patients had oral surgery with local anesthesia at the Department of Oral Surgery, Oral Radiology and Oral Medicine at the University of Basel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Colin BP 306 compact monitor was used during these surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were routinely checked, both before and during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The oral surgical procedure had to be discontinued 17 times, because the patient developed significantly elevated blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twice, the procedure had to be discontinued due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age of these 19 patients was 63.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-and intraoperative monitoring allows the dentist to identify patients with high-risk diagnostic findings and to reduce problematic cardiovascular situations </plain></SENT>
