<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current study investigated whether biofeedback training aimed at increasing respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), a measure of cardiac vagal modulation, can reduce depressive symptoms in patients after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This randomized controlled study enrolled 26 patients after first-time cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly assigned to an RSA-biofeedback group (N = 13) or to a treatment as usual group (N = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biofeedback training consisted of five 45 min sessions designed to increase RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcome was assessed as changes in RSA and in the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) values from pre- to post-training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable for demographic and biomedical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RSA increased significantly in patients who underwent RSA-biofeedback compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D scores were reduced significantly from pre- to post-training in the RSA-biofeedback group compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in RSA were inversely related to changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D scores from pre- to post-training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings extend the effectiveness of RSA-biofeedback for increasing vagal modulation as well as for reducing depressive symptoms in post-surgical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the current study also suggests that this biobehavioral intervention may add to the efficacy of postoperative risk reduction programs and rehabilitation protocols in cardiac surgery patients </plain></SENT>
