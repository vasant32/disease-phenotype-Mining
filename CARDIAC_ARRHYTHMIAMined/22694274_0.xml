<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and spontaneous ventilation for foreign body (FB) removal in pediatric patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a prospective observational clinical study of FB removal using a rigid bronchoscope under <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-remifentanil TIVA and spontaneous ventilation in 65 pediatric patients who presented with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), respiratory rate, endtidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> (ETCO(2))(ETCO2), induction time, and remifentanil rate were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse events, the intervention for these events, and the duration of postoperative care were also of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty children completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean induction time was 12.3 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, the maximum remifentanil rate was 0.14 μg · kg(-1) · min(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Light breath holding occurred in 16 (26.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe breath holding or body movements were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An SpO(2) below 90% occurred in 10 (16.7%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No progressive desaturation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean ETCO(2) at the end of the procedures was 7.91 KPa and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 5 min after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), no hypoxemia was observed and the mean recovery time was 23.4 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngospasm</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi>-remifentanil TIVA and spontaneous ventilation are effective and safe techniques to manage anesthesia during airway FB removal in children with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
