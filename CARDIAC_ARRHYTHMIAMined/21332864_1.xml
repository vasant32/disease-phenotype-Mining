<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 190 consecutive patients with idiopathic VAs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and inferior-axis deviation, 16 were found to have successful ablation site in the right ventricle close to the HB region (para-Hisian group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiologic data were compared between the patients in the para-Hisian group and those with VAs arising from the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract (RVOT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distal bipolar electrogram at the successful ablation sites in the para-Hisian group exhibited a significantly greater R-wave duration, lower R-wave amplitude, and slower upright deflection of the initial R wave than did those in the RVOT group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the para-Hisian group, a total of 56 radiofrequency (RF) energy applications were delivered, of which the local electrograms at 16 successful and 40 unsuccessful ablation sites were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-frequency R-wave potentials of the bipolar electrogram were present in 14 (88%) of the successful ablation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An R-wave duration of greater than 34 ms had a discriminatory power for indicating the site of a successful ablation (area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve 0.90, sensitivity 94%, specificity 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The successful ablation site of the para-Hisian VAs had distinctive local electrogram characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A longer R-wave duration of the bipolar electrogram with high-frequency potentials could be a novel predictor of a successful ablation </plain></SENT>
