<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SCN1Bb encodes the Î²-subunit of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mutation in SCN1Bb R214Q has recently been shown both to increase the Kv4.3 current and to decrease the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variant was suggested to increase the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To sequence a population of BrS and early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) patients for the R214Q mutation in the SCN1Bb gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The coding sequence and splice junctions of SCN1Bb were bidirectionally sequenced by using Big Dye chemistry in 192 early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF patients and 22 BrS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three probands carrying the R214Q variant were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutations were identified in genes previously associated with BrS or AF in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Case 1 also had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of persistent lone AF at the age of 39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a lone AF case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at the age of 39 years and paroxysmal lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 3 was a BrS patient with a type 1 electrocardiogram and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease at the age of 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both lone AF patients had electrocardiograms that raised the suspicion of BrS, but intravenous flecainide testing was, in both cases, negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>R214Q was not present in the control group (n = 216) and has not previously been reported in conjunction to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Three patients of 192 young lone AF and 22 BrS patients carried the nonsynonymous R214Q mutations in SCN1Bb, thereby indicating that this variant increases the susceptibility to both BrS and AF </plain></SENT>
