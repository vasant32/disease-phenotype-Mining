<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence obtained in recent years suggests that SR Ca(2+) release is tightly regulated not only by cytosolic Ca(2+) but also by intra-store Ca(2+) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) that relies on auto-catalytic action of Ca(2+) at the cytosolic side of RyR2s is precisely balanced and counteracted by RyR2 deactivation dependent on a reciprocal decrease of Ca(2+) at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> side of RyR2s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of this inherently unstable Ca(2+) signaling is considered to be an underlying cause of triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and is associated with genetic and acquired forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory role <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> Ca(2+) plays in Ca(2+) handling, with a particular emphasis on the role of Ca(2+)release refractoriness in aberrant Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
