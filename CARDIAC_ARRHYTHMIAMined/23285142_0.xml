<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of nicorandil on the treatment of hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether nicorandil has inhibitory effects on HF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> caused by the activation of G protein alpha q (Gα(q)) -coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling still remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated these inhibitory effects of nicorandil in transgenic mice with transient cardiac expression of activated Gα(q) (Gα(q)-TG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nicorandil (6 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was chronically administered to Gα(q)-TG from 8 to 32 weeks of age, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experiments were performed in mice at the age of 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> nicorandil administration prevented the severe reduction of left ventricular fractional shortening and inhibited ventricular interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in Gα(q)-TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUR-2B and SERCA2 gene expression was decreased in vehicle-treated Gα(q)-TG but not in nicorandil-treated Gα(q)-TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>eNOS gene expression was also increased in nicorandil-treated Gα(q)-TG compared with vehicle-treated Gα(q)-TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) was frequently (more than 20 beats/min) observed in 7 of 10 vehicle-treated Gα(q)-TG but in none of 10 nicorandil-treated Gα(q)-TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The QT interval was significantly shorter in nicorandil-treated Gα(q)-TG than vehicle-treated Gα(q)-TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> nicorandil administration shortened ventricular monophasic action potential duration and reduced the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> in Langendorff-perfused Gα(q)-TG mouse hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HMR1098, a blocker of cardiac sarcolemmal K(ATP) channels, significantly attenuated the shortening of MAP duration induced by nicorandil in the Gα(q)-TG heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that nicorandil can prevent the development of HF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> caused by the activation of GPCR signaling through the shortening of the QT interval, action potential duration, the normalization of SERCA2 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil may also improve the impaired coronary circulation during HF </plain></SENT>
