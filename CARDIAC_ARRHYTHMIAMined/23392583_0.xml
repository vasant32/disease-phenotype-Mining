<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The foundation for successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation is the mapping of electric propagation to identify underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), however, mapping is difficult so that ablation has often targeted electrogram features, with mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that wide field-of-view (panoramic) mapping of both atria would identify causal mechanisms for AF and allow interpretation of local electrogram features, including complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Contact mapping was performed using biatrial multipolar catheters in 36 AF subjects (29 persistent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stable AF rotors (spiral waves) or focal sources were seen in 35 of 36 cases and targeted for ablation (focal impulse and rotor modulation) before pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 31 of 36 subjects (86.1%), AF acutely terminated (n=20; 16 to sinus rhythm) or organized (n=11; 19±8% slowing) with 2.5 minutes focal impulse and rotor modulation (interquartile range, 1.0-3.1) at one source, defined as the primary source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects exhibited 2.1±1.0 concurrent AF sources of which the primary, by phase mapping, precessed in limited areas (persistent 2.5±1.7 versus paroxysmal 1.7±0.5 cm(2); P=0.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, source regions showed mixed electrogram amplitudes and CFAE grades that did not differ from surrounding atrium (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AF sources were not consistently surrounded by CFAE (P=0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stable rotors and focal sources for human AF were revealed by contact panoramic mapping (focal impulse and rotor modulation mapping), but not by electrogram footprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF sources precessed within areas of ≈2 cm(2), with diverse voltage characteristics poorly correlated with CFAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most CFAE sites lie remote from AF sources and are not suitable targets for catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
