<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Action potential (AP) recordings in ex vivo heart preparations constitute an important component of the preclinical cardiac safety assessment according to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> S7B guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most AP measurement models are sensitive, predictive and informative but suffer from a low throughput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, effects of selected anti-arrhythmics (flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, atenolol, sotalol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>) on field/action potentials (FP/AP) of guinea pig and rabbit ventricular slices are presented and compared with data from established in vitro and in vivo models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Data from measurements of membrane currents (hERG, I(Na) ), AP/FP (guinea pig and rabbit ventricular slices), AP (rabbit Purkinje fibre), haemodynamic/ECG parameters (conscious, telemetered dog) were collected, compared and correlated to complementary published data (focused literature search) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: The selected anti-arrhythmics, flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, atenolol, sotalol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, influenced the shape of AP/FP of guinea pig and rabbit ventricular slices in a manner similar to that observed for rabbit PF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings obtained from slice preparations are in line with measurements of membrane currents in vitro, papillary muscle AP in vitro and haemodynamic/ECG parameters from conscious dogs in vivo, and were also corroborated by published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: FP and AP recordings from heart slices correlated well with established in vitro and in vivo models in terms of pharmacology and predictability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart slice preparations yield similar results as papillary muscle but offer enhanced throughput for mechanistic investigations and may substantially reduce the use of laboratory animals </plain></SENT>
