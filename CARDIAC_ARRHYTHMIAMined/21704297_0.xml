<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use of retrograde tube gastrostomy (RG) after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients underwent either NG or RG placement for postoperative conduit decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both tubes were maintained on low continuous suction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2008, 306 patients underwent esophagectomy with reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred ninety-three patients underwent NG and 113 underwent RG placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were comparable in age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, and smoking status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the NG group were more likely to have received neoadjuvant therapy and to have a thoracotomy for esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of respiratory complications was lower in the retrograde group compared with the NG group: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>Pneumonia</z:hpo>, 9 of 113(8.0%) vs 50 of 193 (25.9%), p&lt;0.001; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> requiring bronchoscopy or reintubation, 12 of 113 (10.8%) vs 46 of 193 (23.8%), p=0.004; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, 4 of 113 (3.5%) vs 20 of 193 (10.4%), p=0.045 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias was also lower in the retrograde group (18 of 113 [15.9%] vs 69 of 193 [35.8%], p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of wound complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and conduit <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>-anastomotic leak was similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate regression model an NG tube was the strongest predictor for postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 3.27, 95% confidence interval 1.50 to 7.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other predictors were prior chest surgery, smoking, and thoracotomy incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 4 minor complications related to the retrograde tube (wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> n=1, broken tube requiring endoscopy n=2, tube caught in anastomosis detected intraoperatively n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde gastrostomy decompression of the conduit after esophagectomy is effective and diminishes complications compared with NG tube drainage </plain></SENT>
