<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between the medical history documented by a health professional and the patient's own report may therefore have important health consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical histories of 117 patients with an ACS were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire assessing the patient's health history was then completed by 62 eligible patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information about 13 health conditions with relevance to ACS management was obtained from the questionnaire and the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concordance between these two sources and reasons for discordance were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was significant variation in agreement, from very poor in <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (kappa &lt; 0) to almost perfect in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (kappa = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agreement was substantial in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.76) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.73); moderate in cocaine use (kappa = 0.54), smoking (kappa = 0.46), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (kappa = 0.52) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.54); and fair in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.37), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.31), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (kappa = 0.37) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006277" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchitis</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (kappa = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The odds of agreement was 42% higher among individuals with at least some college education (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.00 - 2.01, p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>Listing</z:mp> of a condition in medical record but not in the questionnaire was a common cause of discordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Discrepancies in aspects of the medical history may have important effects on the care of ACS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future research focused on identifying the most effective and efficient means to obtain accurate health information may improve ACS patient care quality and safety </plain></SENT>
