<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental findings indicate two types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> cells: pacemaking and non-pacemaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have developed two mathematical models for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> cardiomyocytes with and without pacemaking activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The models were reconstructed by modifying an existing model of the human right atrium to incorporate extant experimental data on the electrical differences between the two cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences in their action potential (AP) profiles and automaticity were reproduced by the models, which can be attributed to the observed differences in the current densities of I(NCX), I(to), I(Na) and I(Ca-L), as well as the difference in the channel kinetics of I(Ca-L) and inclusion of the I(f) and I(Ca-T) currents in the pacemaking cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The developed models provide a useful tool suitable for studying the substrates for generating AF </plain></SENT>
