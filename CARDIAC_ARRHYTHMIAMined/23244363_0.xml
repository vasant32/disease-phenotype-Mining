<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally a progressive disease, often more difficult to control as electromechanical remodeling alters the underlying substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients typically evolve from infrequent, self-terminating episodes, to more frequent and sustained events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, atrial remodeling may make sinus rhythm more challenging to achieve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although an ablation strategy limited to pulmonary vein isolation may be curative in those with paroxysmal AF, a more extensive approach is often required in those with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the current approaches and most recent advances in the ablation of persistent and long-standing persistent AF </plain></SENT>
