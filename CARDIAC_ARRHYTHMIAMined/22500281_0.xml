<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pneumonectomy remains the ultimate curative treatment modality for destroyed lung caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> despite multiple risks involved in the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent pneumonectomy for treatment of sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e> to determine the risk factors of early and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1980 and December 2008, pneumonectomy or pleuropneumonectomy was performed in 73 consecutive patients with destroyed lung caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 48 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> (12 with bronchopleural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> [BPF]), 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276651" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergilloma</z:e> and 7 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206526" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multidrug resistant tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5 operative mortalities (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had intraoperative uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, one had a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and three had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 29 patients (39.7%) suffered from postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (16.7%) were found to have postpneumonectomy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi>), 4 patients had wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (5.6%), and 7 patients required re-exploration due to postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (9.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi> increased in patients with preoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were five patients with postoperative BPF, four of which occurred in right-side operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only risk factor for BPF was the right-side operation (p=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 88.9% and 76.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were old age (â‰¥50 years, p=0.02) and low predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (&lt;1.2 L, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi> increases in patients with preoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath> and postoperative BPF increases in right-side operation, the mortality rates and long-term survival rates were found to be satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the follow-up care for patients with low predicted postoperative FEV1 should continue for prevention and early detection of pulmonary complication related to impaired pulmonary function </plain></SENT>
