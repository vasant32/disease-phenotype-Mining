<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation has been used to guide additional left atrial ablation in paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of AF induction in this setting remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the incidence and characteristics of inducible AF in patients without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or clinical AF and the effect of different induction protocols on AF inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 44 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> with no history of AF or risk factors for AF, atrial refractoriness and conduction were measured, followed by AF induction attempts (10/patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each induction was performed after a waiting time that exceeded twice the duration of induced AF from the preceding induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AF≥1 minute was considered inducible, and ≥5 minutes as sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burst pacing (at 200 ms for 10 seconds) was compared to decremental pacing (from 200 ms to shortest cycle length, resulting in 1:1 atrial capture for 10 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 10 inductions, AF was inducible in 49.5%, and sustained in 29.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of both inducible and sustained AF increased with each induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from male gender, no clinical or electrophysiological features were associated with sustained AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Decremental pacing was associated with a higher incidence of sustained AF (41.2% versus 14.8%, P=0.049), longer duration of AF (P=0.006), and shorter mean AF cycle length (P&lt;0.001) compared with burst pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inducible and sustained AF is common in patients in the absence of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or clinical AF, and its incidence varies according to gender, method of induction, and number of inductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is a direct relationship between AF persistence and number of inductions, which has not reached a plateau after 10 inductions </plain></SENT>
