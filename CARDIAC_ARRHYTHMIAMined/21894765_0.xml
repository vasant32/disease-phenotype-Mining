<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that p-tyrosol rapidly penetrates into well perfused organs (brain, heart, kidneys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum concentration ofp-tyrosol in these organs was determined in 1 minute after administration, and the mean distribution constant was within 0.8-1.11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The albumin bound fraction ofp-tyrozol amounted to 0.26-0.30 </plain></SENT>
