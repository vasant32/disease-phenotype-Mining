<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The difference in the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contraction</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>) between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/PVT and monomorphic VT (MVT) from the RVOT, however, has not yet been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: The electrocardiogram findings and the clinical characteristics were compared between 14 patients with PVT and 77 with MVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> were more frequent in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and/or PVT group (57%) than in the MVT group (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An initial <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> with a positive QRS complex in lead I was observed in 10 (71%) of 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/PVT, and in 27 (35%) of 77 patients with MVT (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation targeting the trigger <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> often produced a morphological change, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/PVT was eliminated in 13 (93%) of 14 patients after additional RF applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> from the RVOT, although rare, should be considered when the patient has a syncopal episode and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> with a positive QRS complex in lead I.  (Circ J 2013; 77: 968-974) </plain></SENT>
