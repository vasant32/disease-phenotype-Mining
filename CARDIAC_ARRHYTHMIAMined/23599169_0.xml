<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remote CIED management has been established as a safe alternative to conventional periodical in-office FU (CFU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An economic model compares the long-term cost and consequences of using daily Home MonitoringÂ® (HM) instead of CFU.METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-consequence evaluation comparing HM vs. CFU was performed using a Markov cohort model and data relating to events and costs identified via a systematic review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model is conservative, without assuming a reduction of cardiovascular events by HM such as decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or mortality, or considering cost savings such as for transportation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also cost savings due to an improved timing of elective device replacement, and fewer FU visits needed in patients near device replacement are not considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 10 years, HM is predicted to be cost neutral at about GBP 11 500 per patient in either treatment arm, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> costs for the initial investment into HM and fees for ongoing remote monitoring included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fewer inappropriate shocks (-51%) reduce the need for replacing devices for battery exhaustion (-7%); the number of FU visits is predicted to be halved by HM.CONCLUSION: From a UK National Health Service perspective, HM is cost neutral over 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is mainly accomplished by reducing the number of battery charges and inappropriate shocks, resulting in fewer device replacements, and by reducing the number of in-clinic FU visits </plain></SENT>
