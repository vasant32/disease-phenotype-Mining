<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plasma B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) is abnormally elevated in patients with lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact significance and prognostic implications of this elevation have yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about BNP in lone AF patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the relationship between BNP levels and the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after ablation of lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We followed up 726 patients with lone AF undergoing first-time <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had BNP levels measured on the day of ablation with of the point-of-care Triage Meter assay (Biosite Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, factors associated with elevated BNP levels in multivariable linear regression analysis (with log BNP being the dependent variable) were older age (β regression coefficient for +1-year change, 0.025; P&lt;0.0001), longer duration of AF (β for +1-year change, 0.031; P=0.01), nonparoxysmal AF (versus paroxysmal; β, 0.52; P&lt;0.0001), and larger left atrial size (β for +1-cm(2) change, 0.040; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BNP levels were strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence in univariate- (hazard ratio for +1-log-BNP change, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.11 to 2.74; P&lt;0.001) and covariate- (hazard ratio for +1-log-BNP change, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 2.06 to 2.38; P&lt;0.001) adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The covariate-adjusted hazard ratios for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were 1.6, 2.7, 4.3, and 5.7 for the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles, respectively, compared with patients in the lowest quintile (P for trend across quintiles &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels correlate with AF burden (chronicity, altered hemodynamics, and anatomic remodeling) in patients with lone AF and are strong predictors of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated BNP levels may reflect increased cardiac chamber wall stress and/or intrinsic atrial disease, thus increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
