<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well known that familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) is caused by functional alterations of ion channels and gap junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on the mechanism of age-related non-familial SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although evidence shows a close link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and the renin-angiotensin system (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), it remains to be determined whether the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> is involved in the pathogenesis of non-familial SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 113 patients with documented non-familial SSS and 125 controls were screened for angiotensinogen (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) and gap junction protein-connexin 40 (Cx40) promoter polymorphisms by gene sequencing, followed by an association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A luciferase assay was used to determine the transcriptional activity of the promoter polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interaction between nuclear factors and the promoter polymorphism was characterized by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Association study showed the Cx40 -44/+71 polymorphisms are not associated with non-familial SSS; however, it indicated that four polymorphic sites at positions -6, -20, -152, and -217 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> promoter are linked to non-familial SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, SSS patients had a lower frequency of the G-6A AA genotype (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.58-5.22, P = 0.001) and a higher frequency of the G allele at -6 position (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.54-4.57, P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EMSA and luciferase assays confirmed that nucleotide G at position -6 modulates the binding affinity with nuclear factors and yields a lower transcriptional activity than nucleotide A (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: G-6A polymorphism, which modulates the transcriptional activity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e> promoter, may contribute to non-familial SSS susceptibility </plain></SENT>
