<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with HFREF (age, 59 ± 6 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, 27% ± 6%; New York Heart Association class I to III) were randomly assigned to a single session of HIIE (2 × 8 min) corresponding to 30 s at 100% of peak power output (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53262">PPO</z:chebi>) and 30 s passive recovery intervals or to a MICE (22 min) at 60% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53262">PPO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gas exchange and central hemodynamic parameters (cardiac bioimpedance) were measured continuously during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxygen uptake, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and arterio-venous difference (C(a-v)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean oxygen uptake and ventilation were lower during HIIE vs. MICE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CO, SV, and C(a-v)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) were not different between MICE and HIIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optimized HIIE was well tolerated (similar perceived exertion) and no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and (or) abnormal blood pressure responses occurred during HIEE session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with MICE, optimized HIIE elicited similar central hemodynamic and C(a-v)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> responses in HFREF patients with lower oxygen uptake and ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HIIE may be an efficient exercise training modality in patients with HFREF </plain></SENT>
