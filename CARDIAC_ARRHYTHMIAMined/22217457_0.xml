<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Complement And Reduction of INfarct size after Angioplasty or Lytics trials of pexelizumab used <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK)-MB area under the curve to determine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prediction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was carried out by measuring CK-MB area under the curve in patients with ST-segment elevation MI treated with reperfusion therapy from January 2000 to April 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was calculated in 1622 patients (PCI=817; fibrinolysis=805) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between baseline demographics, total ST-segment elevation, index angiographic findings (PCI group), and binary outcome of CK-MB area under the curve greater than 3000 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurred in 63% (515) of the PCI group and 69% (554) of the fibrinolysis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> differed depending on mode of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PCI, male sex, no prior coronary revascularization and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, decreased systolic blood pressure, sum of ST-segment elevation, total (angiographic) occlusion, and nonright coronary artery culprit artery were independent predictors of larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (C index=0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fibrinolysis, younger age, <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp>, white race, no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, increased time to fibrinolytic therapy in patients treated up to 2 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and sum of ST-segment elevation were independently associated with a larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (C index=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical and patient data can be used to predict larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on the basis of CK-MB quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These models may be helpful in designing future trials and in guiding the use of novel pharmacotherapies aimed at limiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
