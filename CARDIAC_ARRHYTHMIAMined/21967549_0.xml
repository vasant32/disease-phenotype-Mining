<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In our practice, we noticed that patients respond differently when pacemaker insertion is recommended to them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We then saw the need to study how African patients accept elective pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study was conducted to determine African patients' responses to elective pacemaker insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients who reported at our outpatient clinic with indications for elective pacemaker insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study period lasted 64 months from September 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were counseled before insertion and we sought their consent before being recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five possible responses were used to grade acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were followed up for 12 months each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who were brought in emergency and those who refused participation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those who missed follow-up were also dropped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (n = 92) met our study criteria after dropping eight patients who missed follow-up clinic attendance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the candidates (71.7%) felt they had no options but to accept pacemakers at the time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining candidates either accepted the procedure with hope or wholeheartedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of the candidates migrated up the ladder of acceptance over the 12-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We concluded that most patients would accept pacemakers wholeheartedly over time </plain></SENT>
