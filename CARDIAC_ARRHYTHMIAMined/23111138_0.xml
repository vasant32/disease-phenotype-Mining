<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rate control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is a main treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are scarce on the relative efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> and β blockers or between drugs within each class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of 4 rate-reducing, once-daily drug regimens on the ventricular heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms in patients with permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 60 patients (mean age 71 ± 9 years, 18 women) with permanent AF in an investigator-blind cross-over study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diltiazem 360 mg/day, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> 240 mg/day, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> 100 mg/day, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> 25 mg/day were administered for 3 weeks in a randomized sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour heart rate was measured using Holter monitoring, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms were assessed using the Symptom Checklist questionnaire before randomization and on the last day of each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 ± 12 beats/min at baseline (no treatment), 75 ± 10 beats/min with diltiazem, 81 ± 11 beats/min with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, 82 ± 11 beats/min with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, and 84 ± 11 beats/min with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> drugs reduced the heart rate compared to baseline (p &lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 24-hour heart rate was significantly lower with diltiazem than with any other drug tested (p &lt;0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to baseline, diltiazem significantly reduced both the frequency (p &lt;0.001) and the severity (p = 0.005) of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reduced symptom frequency only (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, diltiazem 360 mg/day was the most effective drug regimen for reducing the heart rate in patients with permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms were reduced by treatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> diltiazem and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, but not by the β blockers </plain></SENT>
