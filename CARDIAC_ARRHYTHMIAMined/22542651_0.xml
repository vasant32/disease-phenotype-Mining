<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we examine the prospective association between self-report adult attachment style and self-concept recovery among 89 adults following a recent marital separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>People high in attachment avoidance are characterized by the tendency to deactivate (i.e., suppress) painful attachment-related thoughts and feelings, and, following Fagundes, Diamond, and Allen (2012), we hypothesized that highly avoidant people would show better or worse self-concept outcomes depending on their ability to successfully regulate their emotional experience during a divorce-related mental recall task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We operationalized self-regulation using respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and found that highly avoidant people who showed RSA increases across our divorce-related mental activation task (DMAT) evidenced improvements in their self-concept over three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, highly avoidant adults who showed RSA decreases during the DMAT showed no improvement (or a worsening) in their self-concept disruptions over the subsequent three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that RSA, an index of heart rate variability, may provide a window into self-regulation that has the potential to shed new light on why some people cope well or poorly following the loss of a relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Discussion centers on the potential mechanisms of action that explain why some people are able to successfully deactivate attachment-related thoughts and feelings whereas other people are not </plain></SENT>
