<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to develop and validate a risk model of mortality after pulmonary resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 18,049 lung resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> were entered into the French national database Epithor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two independent analyses were performed with comorbidity variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first analysis included variables as independent predictive binary comorbidities (model 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second analysis included the number of comorbidities per patient (model 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In model 1 predictors for mortality were age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, performance status, forced expiratory volume (as a percentage), body mass index (in kilograms per meter squared), side, type of lung resection,extended resection, stage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004469'>chronic bronchitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, history of malignant disease, and prior thoracic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In model 2 predictors were age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, performance status, forced expiratory volume, body mass index, side, type of lung resection, extended resection, stage, and number of comorbidities per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Models 1 and 2 were well calibrated, with a slope correction factor of 0.96 and of 0.972, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.784 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.8) in model 1 and 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.797) in model 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our preference is for the well-calibrated model 2 because it is easier to use in practice to estimate the adjusted postoperative mortality of lung resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
