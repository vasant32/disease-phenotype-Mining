<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, however the mechanism(s) causing AF remain poorly understood and therapy is suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) is the major calcium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>) release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) required for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we sought to determine whether intracellular diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak via RyR2 plays a role in triggering AF and whether inhibiting this leak can prevent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated 3 knock-in mice with mutations introduced into RyR2 that result in leaky channels and cause exercise induced polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in humans [catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined AF susceptibility in these three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mouse models harboring RyR2 mutations to explore the role of diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AF was stimulated with an intra-esophageal burst pacing protocol in the 3 CPVT mouse models (RyR2-R2474S+/-, 70%; RyR2-N2386I+/-, 60%; RyR2-L433P+/-, 35.71%) but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these in vivo results, there was a significant diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak in atrial myocytes isolated from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) is an RyR2 subunit that stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 and prevents a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak through the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atrial RyR2 from RyR2-R2474S+/- mice were oxidized, and the RyR2 macromolecular complex was depleted of calstabin2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Rycal drug S107 stabilizes the closed state of RyR2 by inhibiting the oxidation/phosphorylation induced dissociation of calstabin2 from the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>S107 reduced the diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak in atrial myocytes and decreased burst pacing-induced AF in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>S107 did not reduce the increased prevalence of burst pacing-induced AF in calstabin2-deficient mice, confirming that calstabin2 is required for the mechanism of action of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that RyR2-mediated diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak in atrial myocytes is associated with AF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Rycal S107 inhibited diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak through RyR2 and pacing-induced AF associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mutations </plain></SENT>
