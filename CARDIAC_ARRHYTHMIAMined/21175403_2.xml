<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Starting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> treatment in the 1980s, RF ablation has found clinical application in a number of diseases, and is now the treatment of choice for certain types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During RF ablation, an electrode is inserted into or steered intravascularly to the target tissue region under medical imaging guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, a tissue volume surrounding the electrode is destroyed by heating via RF electric current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the biophysics of tissue heating during RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of electrical tissue conductivity and its change with temperature are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedures and devices specific for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> treatment are presented with a brief discussion of additional clinical applications </plain></SENT>
