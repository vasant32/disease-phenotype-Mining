<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of this role and how it may differ between species are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we used computational modelling to assess the impact of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> maintenance in the rabbit ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we quantified the dynamics of excitation wavefronts during episodes of simulated tachyarrhythmias and fibrillatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, defined as being respectively characterised by relatively low and high spatio-temporal disorganisation.Two computational models were used: a highly anatomically detailed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-derived rabbit ventricular model (representing vasculature, endocardial structures) and a simplified equivalent model, constructed from the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-data but lacking such fine-scale anatomical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During tachyarrhythmias, anatomically complex and simplified models showed very similar dynamics; however, during fibrillatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, as activation wavelength decreased, the presence of fine-scale anatomical details appeared to marginally increase disorganisation of wavefronts during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the complex model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a small amount of clustering of reentrant rotor centres (filaments) around endocardial structures was witnessed in follow-up analysis (which slightly increased during <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> as rotor size decreased), this was significantly less than previously reported in large animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no anchoring of reentrant rotors was visibly identifiable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> movies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences between tachy- and fibrillatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> suggest that the relative size of reentrant rotors with respect to anatomical obstacles governs the influence of fine-scale <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in the maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our simulations suggest that fine-scale anatomical features play little apparent role in the maintenance of tachyarrhythmias in the rabbit ventricles and, contrary to experimental reports in larger animals, appear to play only a minor role in the maintenance of fibrillatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings also have important implications in optimising the level of detail required in anatomical computational meshes frequently used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> investigations </plain></SENT>
