<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Our insights into physiological and pathophysiological cardiac excitation-contraction coupling has greatly benefited from significant advancement in optical technologies such as high-speed confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has pushed pixel dwell times into the time domain of nanoseconds, resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios, which have limited data analysis and interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Line scan imaging has been and still is dominant in high speed confocal recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It allows analysis only of a small fraction of a cell's cross section (1.5%), but the appreciation of spatiotemporal fine details of excitation-contraction coupling is instrumental for the further understanding of pathological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aim to provide a novel analysis tool to extract otherwise hidden fine details in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling from high-speed 2-dimensional confocal image series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate that high-speed 2-dimensional confocal data (150 frames/s) can be analyzed quantitatively by a pixel-wise fitting approach, using a mathematical formalism to phenomenologically describe local calcium transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such an approach produces virtually noise-free fluorescence data originating from minute volumes (0.025 femtoliter) and allows extraction of detailed and most importantly quantitative and mechanistically novel information on microscopic calcium signaling and excitation-contraction coupling in a robust manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pixel-wise fitting provides novel insights into cardiac excitation-contraction coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it revealed microscopic calcium alternans on the level of individual coupling sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microscopic calcium alternans is an early precursor of cellular alternans and as such will shed more light onto this mechanism leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
