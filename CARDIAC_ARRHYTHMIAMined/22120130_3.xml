<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined if long-term supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oils commenced &gt;1 month prior to electrical cardioversion and continued thereafter reduces recurrence of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized study of 178 patients with persistent AF &gt;1-month duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were assigned to control group (n = 87) or omega-3 group (6 g/d fish oil; n = 91) and underwent cardioversion 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrent antiarrhythmic use of sotalol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was permitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fish oil was continued till return of persistent AF or a maximum of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat analysis was performed for the primary end point defined as the recurrence of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean duration of fish oil intake was 56 days precardioversion and a total of 242 days in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eicosapentaenoic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi>, the active components of fish oils, were 1.8-fold and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, in the omega-3 group compared with controls at the time of cardioversion (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 90 days, 38.5% of the patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acid</z:chebi> supplement had AF recurrence compared with 77.5% of the controls (hazard ratio [omega-3 vs control] 0.38; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.56; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Omega-3 intake was associated with a significant reduction in AF recurrence with or without concurrent antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation commenced &gt;1 month prior to electrical cardioversion and continued thereafter reduces the recurrence of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials on long-term fish oil supplementation are needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
