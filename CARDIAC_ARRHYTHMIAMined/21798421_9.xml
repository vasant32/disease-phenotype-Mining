<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and the long-term course of a large cohort of patients with short QT syndrome (SQTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SQTS is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> characterized by an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on the long-term outcome of SQTS patients are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients from the European Short QT Registry (75% males; median age: 26 years) were followed up for 64 ± 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A familial or personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> was present in 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> was the clinical presentation in 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average QTc was 314 ± 23 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mutation in genes related to SQTS was found in 23% of the probands; most of them had a gain of function mutation in HERG (SQTS1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and 12 patients received long-term prophylaxis with hydroquinidine (HQ), which was effective in preventing the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a HERG mutation had shorter QTc at baseline and a greater QTc prolongation after treatment with HQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 2 already symptomatic patients received appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonsustained polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was recorded in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The event rate was 4.9% per year in the patients without antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No arrhythmic events occurred in patients receiving HQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SQTS carries a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients have a high risk of recurrent arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>HQ is effective in preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmia induction and arrhythmic events during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
