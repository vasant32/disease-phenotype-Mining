<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-quality digital recordings transmitted wirelessly by cellular telephone networks have augmented the prehospital use of transportable electrocardiogram machines as well as implantable devices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of prehospital electrocardiogram recording and interpretation in patients suspected of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It enables a more widespread access to rapid reperfusion therapy, thereby reducing treatment delay, morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring has improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnosis and dynamic ST-segment changes have been shown to provide important prognostic information in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, remote recording or monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and vital signs seem to improve outcome and reduce the necessity of re-admissions or outpatient contacts in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the future telemonitoring and diagnosis is expected to further impact the way we practice cardiology and provide better care for the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
