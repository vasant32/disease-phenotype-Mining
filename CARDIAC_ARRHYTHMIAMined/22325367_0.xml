<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the mainstay of therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation requires the use of fluoroscopy, thus exposing patients to ionising radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The feasibility and safety of non-fluoroscopic radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported in a wide range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> using the EnSite NavX™ mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The NO-PARTY is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> guided by the EnSite NavX™ mapping system results in a clinically significant reduction in exposure to ionising radiation compared with conventional catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study will randomise 210 patients undergoing catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> to either a conventional ablation technique or one guided by the EnSite NavX™ mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point is the reduction of the radiation dose to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary end-points include procedural success, reduction of the radiation dose to the operator, and a cost-effectiveness analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients, we will also evaluate the radiobiological effectiveness of dose reduction by assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> chromosomal DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NO-PARTY will determine whether radiofrequency catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> guided by the EnSite NavX™ mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to achieve a clinically significant reduction in ionising radiation exposure for both patient and operator </plain></SENT>
