<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Abnormal sympathetic innervation underlies both long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) after MI is higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to explore sympathetic neural remodeling after MI in diabetic rabbits and its relationship with VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rabbits were randomly assigned to 4 groups: control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM), MI and diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (DI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After electrophysiological experiments in vivo, immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR were used to measure sympathetic innervations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test the function of sympathetic nerve fibers, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The corrected QT interval and QT dispersion were significantly more prolonged with DI than other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The density of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers and corresponding <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance was significantly higher with DI than with DM and under control conditions, but was lower than with the MI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the distribution and structure of regenerated nerve was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in DI rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> content was higher in the DI group, and accompanied by an increased quantity of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MI results in sympathetic neural remodeling in diabetic rabbits, which may be responsible in part for the increased occurrence of VAs </plain></SENT>
