<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, rate of progression, disease complications, as well as overall prognosis and outcome vary both amongst and within families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical traits, both cardiac and extracardiac, may recur in association with the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, structural abnormalities such as left ventricular noncompaction, of right ventricular involvement, and recurrence of atrial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>; the latter commonly affect the musculoskeletal (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathies</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophies</z:mpath>, both clinically overt and subclinical), ocular, auditory, <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>, and integument systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These traits may help guide genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel to the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, F-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> also shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>: more than 40 genes have been causally linked to F-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, with mutations recurring more commonly in a few known genes, and less frequently in rare, less commonly known genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the known prevalence of mutations in disease genes, more than 50% of F-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> cases can be regarded as still genetically orphan, implying that further disease genes have to be discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family screening and genetic testing are now established as the gold standard for diagnosis, care, and prevention in F-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic tests are performed using Sanger-based sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, new biotechnology tools, based on next-generation sequencing, are now being implemented in the research setting and will dramatically modify the future of the nosology of F-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
