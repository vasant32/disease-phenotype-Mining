<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that instituting a process of routine daily review of rhythm alarms in non-cardiac patients in the pediatric intensive care unit would yield clinically important disturbances that would otherwise go undetected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study was performed over a consecutive 28-day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total bedside monitor alarms, rhythm alarms, and heart rate (HR) trends were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rhythm alarm recordings were reviewed independently by two study team members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records for patients with critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were reviewed to evaluate for prior knowledge of the event and to correlate with clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 86 patients (343 patient-days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 54 656 total monitor alarms (159.3 alarms/patient-day), of which 19 970 (37%) were rhythm alarms, including 4032 (20%) critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent of the critical alarms were artifactual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 1786 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> alarms represented true episodes that occurred in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients' care were altered as a result of detection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the review process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred sixty-five (98%) of the 883 true critical alarms reviewed were for extreme HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent (5172) of the 6239 true non-critical alarms reviewed were HR alarms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Daily review of rhythm alarms improves detection of clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in non-cardiac pediatric intensive care unit patients </plain></SENT>
