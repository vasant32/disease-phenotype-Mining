<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that the modulation of fibrotic scar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> has beneficial effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent reports suggest a potential role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor upregulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor blocker and a potent antifibrotic agent, in AF is as yet unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor blocker with potent antifibrotic properties, has beneficial effects on AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">Spironolactone</z:chebi> therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> provides additional clinical benefits in addition to the current conventional pharmacological agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive retrospective analysis was performed on 83 patients with AF, including 23 who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> for â‰¥3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined primary outcome of hospitalization for AF or direct current cardioversion (DCCV) was compared between patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> in addition to the usual care for AF and those receiving conventional medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> had significantly fewer primary outcome events (AF-related hospitalizations or DCCV) (22% vs 53%, P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">Spironolactone</z:chebi> therapy is associated with a reduction in the burden of AF, as reflected by a combination of hospitalizations for AF and DCCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger randomized controlled studies should be performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> as an adjunctive therapy for patients with AF </plain></SENT>
