<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, but 15-25Â % have low systolic blood pressure with or without signs and/or symptoms of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pharmacological agents known to improve the prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> also reduce blood pressure, and this limits their use in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>low blood pressure</z:hpo> (HF-LBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, patients with HF-LBP have much higher in-hospital and post-discharge mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, a conceptually important therapeutic target is to improve cardiac output in order to alleviate signs of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the majority of these patients will require an inotrope as cardiac dysfunction is the cause of their low cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the short-term use of currently available inotropes has been associated with further decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate, myocardial oxygen consumption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Agents that improve cardiac contractility without this undesirable effects should be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, the epidemiology, pathophysiology and therapy of patients with HF-LBP have not been addressed thoroughly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In June 2010, a workshop that included scientists and clinicians was held in Rome, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this meeting were to (1) develop a working definition for HF-LBP, (2) describe its clinical characteristics and pathophysiology, (3) review current therapies and their limitations, (4) discuss novel agents in development and (5) create a framework for the design and conduct of future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
