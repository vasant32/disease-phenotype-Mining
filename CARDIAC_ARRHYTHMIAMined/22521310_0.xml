<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Important adjustments in the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system occur during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>Bradycardia</z:hpo>, due to increased vagal tone, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, caused by reduction of sympathetic activity, may occur during non rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (NREM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased sympathetic activity, causing <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp>, is conversely a feature of phasic REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During REM sleep, sinus arrests and atrioventricular (AV) blocks unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are very rare and only a few cases have been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Following an ECG performed for other reasons, two patients with no history of sleep complaints nor symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> were referred to our center for nocturnal brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24h ECG Holter recorded several episodes of brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with sinus arrest in the first patients and brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients, episodes of brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were prevalent in the second part of the night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) demonstrated that episodes occurred only during REM sleep, particularly during phasic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with pacemaker was considered only for the patient with complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV blocks</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These types of brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are usually detected accidentally due to their lack of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that in some patients they may lead to sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the identification of predisposing factors is mandatory in order to prevent potentially dangerous arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
