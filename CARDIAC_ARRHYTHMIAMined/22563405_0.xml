<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates differences in comorbidity between men and women, and tests the hypothesis that comorbidity contributes to sex-related differences in mortality in oxygen-dependent COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: National prospective study of patients aged 50 years or older, starting long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for COPD in Sweden between 1992 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities were obtained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex-related differences in comorbidity were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, smoking status and year of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of comorbidity on overall mortality and the interaction between comorbidity and sex were evaluated using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, Pa<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27140">(O2)</z:chebi> breathing air, FEV(1), smoking history and year of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 8,712 patients (55% women) were included and 6,729 patients died during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with women, men had significantly more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> odds ratios) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity was an independent predictor of mortality, and the effect was similar for the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Women had lower mortality, which remained unchanged even after adjusting for comorbidity; hazard ratio 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.77; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity is different in men and women, but does not explain the sex-related difference in mortality in oxygen-dependent COPD </plain></SENT>
