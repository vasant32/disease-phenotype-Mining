<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>Atrial flutter</z:hpo> is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> seen in the emergency department (ED), yet there is little research describing its management and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyze the success and safety of treatment of ED patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study obtained by searching the ED administrative database of 2 urban hospitals to identify consecutive patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> from April 1, 2006, to January 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We linked each patient's unique provincial health number to the provincial vital statistics registry and the regional ED database to identify subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Manual chart review was conducted to confirm rhythms and outcomes and to identify patient comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into 5 groups based on initial ED presentation and management approach: electrocardioversion, chemical cardioversion, spontaneous cardioversion, rate control only, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ED <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the combined 1-year rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and secondary outcomes included the proportion of eligible patients with conversion to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm in each group and discharged to home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 122 consecutive patients with a primary ED diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> were collected; there were 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.5%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 5.1%) in the following year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing electrocardioversion achieved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm 91% of the time, with 93% discharged home; patients undergoing oral or intravenous antiarrhythmic treatment achieved sinus rhythm 27% of the time, with 60% discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discharge rates of patients with spontaneous cardioversion, rate control, and no ED treatment were 93%, 58%, and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this 2-center cohort of ED patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, patients eligible for rhythm control had a higher success and lower admission rate with electrocardioversion than patients treated with antiarrhythmic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the majority of patients were discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were typically related to concurrent medical illness rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
