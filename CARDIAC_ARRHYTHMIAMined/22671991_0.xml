<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio are used as an index of ventricular arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> has been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization in patients with OSA by using Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have studied 72 patients who underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) between the years 2010-2011 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate and severe OSA (23 patients; mean age: 45±10), according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index, constituted the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PSG (23 patients; mean age: 42±11) were used as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, Tp-e/QTc ratio, as well as some other electrocardiogram intervals were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent samples t-tests were used for comparison of continuous and categorical variables and correlations were calculated by Spearman rank correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although QT and QTc intervals were not different between the groups, mean Tp-e interval (81.6±11.1 msn; 63.9±7.3 msn; respectively; P &lt; 0.001), Tp-e/QT ratio (0.21��0.03; 0.17±0.02; respectively; P &lt; 0.001), and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.20±0.03; 0.16±0.02; respectively; P &lt; 0.001) were prolonged in the study group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the presence of moderate and severe OSA and Tp-e interval (r = 0.72; P &lt; 0.001), Tpe/QT ratio (r = 0.70; P &lt; 0.001), and Tp-e/QTc ratio (r = 0.70; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio are prolonged in patients with moderate and severe OSA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is a positive correlation between the presence of OSA and Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio, and Tp-e/QTc ratio </plain></SENT>
