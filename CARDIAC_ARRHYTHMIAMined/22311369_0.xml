<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The MiroCam (IntroMedic, Ltd., Seoul, Korea) is a small-bowel capsule endoscope that uses human body communication to transmit data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential interactions between cardiac devices and the capsule endoscope are causes for concern, but no data are available for this matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: This clinical study was designed to evaluate the potential influence of the MiroCam capsules on cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with cardiac pacemakers or implantable cardiac defibrillators referred for evaluation of small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e> were prospectively enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before capsule endoscopy, a cardiologist checked baseline electrocardiograms and functions of the cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac rhythms were continuously monitored by 24-h telemetry during capsule endoscopy in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After completion of procedures, functions of the cardiac devices were checked again for interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Images from the capsule endoscopy were reviewed and analyzed for technical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients, three with pacemakers and three with implantable cardiac defibrillators, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified no disturbances in the cardiac devices and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> detected on telemetry monitoring during capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in the programmed parameters of the cardiac devices were noted after capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no imaging disturbances from the cardiac devices on capsule endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Capsule endoscopy using human body communication to transmit data was safely performed in patients with cardiac pacemakers or implantable cardiac defibrillators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Images from the capsule endoscopy were not affected by cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A further large-scale study is required to confirm the safety of capsule endoscopy with various types of cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
