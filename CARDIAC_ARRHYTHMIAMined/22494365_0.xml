<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the role of baseline QRS pattern to predict response in terms of improvement in biventricular ejection fraction (EF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (pts) undergoing CRT implantation underwent radionuclide angiography at baseline and at mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between baseline QRS pattern and mechanical dyssynchrony using phase analysis was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in left and right ventricular EF (LVEF and RVEF) were analyzed with regard to baseline QRS pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We enrolled 56 pts, 32 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>), 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>) and 20 with non-specific intraventricular conduction disturbance (IVCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 48 pts completed follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> pts had significantly greater improvement in LVEF compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> or non-specific IVCD pts (+9.6 ± 10.9% vs. +2.6 ± 7.6%, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response (defined as ≥ 5% increase in LVEF) was observed in 68% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> vs. 24% of non-specific IVCD pts (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> pts were responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RVEF was significantly improved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> (+5.0 ± 9.0%, p = 0.007), but not in non-specific IVCD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> pts (+0.4 ± 5.8%, p = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> was the only predictor of LVEF response (OR, 7.45; 95% CI 1.80-30.94; p = 0.006), but not QRS duration or extent of mechanical dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> is a marker of a positive response to CRT in terms of biventricular improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pts with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> pattern show significantly less benefit from CRT than those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
