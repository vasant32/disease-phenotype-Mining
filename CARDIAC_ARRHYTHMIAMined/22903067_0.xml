<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various computer methods have been developed for automatic detection of electrode misplacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we reviewed and compared the performance of two algorithms with the highest accuracies on several databases from PhysioNet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These algorithms were implemented into four models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For clean ECG records with clearly distinguishable waves, the best model produced excellent accuracies (&gt; = 98.4%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> misplacements except the LA/LL interchange (87.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracies were significantly lower for records with noise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, when the algorithms were tested on a database that was independent from the training database, the accuracies may be poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the worst scenario, the best accuracies for different types of misplacements ranged from 36.1% to 78.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large number of ECGs of various qualities and pathological conditions are collected every day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To improve the quality of health care, the results of this paper call for more robust and accurate algorithms for automatic detection of electrode misplacement, which should be developed and tested using a database of extensive ECG records </plain></SENT>
