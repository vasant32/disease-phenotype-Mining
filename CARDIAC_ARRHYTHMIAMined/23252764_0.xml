<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternal depressive symptoms were measured 2 months postpartum with the Brief Symptom Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 14 months, we assessed infant attachment with a slightly shortened Strange Situation and measured infant resting heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) was calculated using spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of maternal postnatal depressive symptoms predicted lower resting RSA in disorganized infants (B = -0.31, SE = 0.15, p = .04, R(2)  = .05) but not in nondisorganized infants (B = 0.05, SE = 0.06, p = .36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was buffered in disorganized infants with a secondary secure attachment classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disorganized infants were more vulnerable to the effect of maternal postnatal depressive symptoms on the physiological stress systems </plain></SENT>
