<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Having a positive effect on the human body, these compounds are used as dietary supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the observed increase in the consumption of dietary supplements taken along with the drugs routinely used in medical practice, this study examined the possibility of interactions between alyssin and drugs, which could have an impact on cell metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined the effects of the tested substances and their interactions on the expression and activity of the phase 2 genes, as well as on the drug transport, which could be influenced by affecting the expression of transport proteins that belong to the 3 phase of metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was also studied whether the transcription factor Nrf2 is responsible for the interactions that occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the interactions between alyssin and the tested drugs strengthen or weaken the effect of the drugs given separately depending on the concentration of alyssin and the type of drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though Nrf2 is involved in the interaction, it seems that it is not the only factor regulating the interactions between the tested medications </plain></SENT>
