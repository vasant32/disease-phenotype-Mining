<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrocardiographic early repolarization (ER) pattern has been previously associated with arrhythmic mortality and with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that there is an association between ER and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study included 432 consecutive victims of SCD because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event and 532 survivors of such an event, in whom 12-lead ECGs recorded before and unrelated to the event could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SCDs were verified by medicolegal autopsy to be because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ER was defined as an elevation of the QRS-ST junction in at least 2 inferior or lateral leads, manifested as QRS notching or slurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ER pattern â‰¥0.1 mV was more common in cases (62/432; 14.4%) than controls (42/532; 7.9%) (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The victims of SCD were younger, were more commonly men and smokers, had lower body mass index, had elevated heart rate, had prolonged QRS complex, and had lower prevalence of history of prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustments for baseline differences, the odds ratio for J waves without ST-segment elevation in the SCD group was 2.15 (95% CI, 1.20-3.85; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of ER in a standard 12-lead ECG in victims of SCD than in survivors of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary event suggests that the presence of ER increases the vulnerability to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and provides a plausible mechanistic link between this ECG pattern and higher arrhythmic mortality of middle-aged/elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
