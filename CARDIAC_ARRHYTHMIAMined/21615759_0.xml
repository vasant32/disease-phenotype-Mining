<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:  <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden in patients receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) after monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (mVT) is higher than in patients with other indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> profile in this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:  Fifty-two patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted after mVT were followed up for at least 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cycle lengths (CLs) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> recovered from the device memory were compared with the CL of the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological analysis of the intracardiac electrograms was performed and the response to antitachycardia pacing (ATP) was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:  A total of 833 mVT episodes with intracardiac electrograms occurred during the follow-up (3-58 months; mean: 30.3 months) in 41 of the 52 patients analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>mVTs with different CLs as compared with the index mVT were found in 26 (50.0%), and at least two different mVT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> were observed in 28 (53.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple mVT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> were predictive of lower ATP efficacy (95.6%, 85.0%, and 70.3% in the patients with 1, 2, and 3 or more mVT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp>, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) and a higher shock burden (4.2%, 19.3%, and 24.7% in the patients with 1, 2, and 3 or more mVT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp>, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:  A high mVT burden was demonstrated with marked variability of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> as concerns both CL and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted for mVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple mVT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> during the follow-up were predictive of lower ATP efficacy and a higher shock burden </plain></SENT>
