<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since chewing has been shown to inhibit stress-induced neuronal responses in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that chewing could ameliorate stress-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we analyzed changes in radiotelemetered electrocardiograms in rats that were allowed to chew a wooden stick during a 1-h period of immobilization stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chewing significantly reduced the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>) and complex ventricular ectopy after immobilization and prevented stress-induced prolongation of the QT interval of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> throughout the 10-h experimental period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also prevented prolongation of the QRS complex and fluctuations in the QT interval in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm beats preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> during both immobilization and in the poststress period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fast Fourier transform-based spectral analysis of heart-rate variability further showed that chewing significantly inhibited the stress-induced increase in the power ratio of low-to-high frequency activity (LF/HF: a marker of sympathetic activity) during immobilization and in addition was associated with blunting of the stress-induced increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> observed at the termination of immobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar suppressive effects on the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> and the LF/HF were observed in rats that were administered the Î²-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenergic blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> before immobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that chewing can ameliorate sympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> during stress and prevent poststress <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and suggest that chewing may provide a nonpharmacological and cost-effective treatment option for patients with a high risk of stress-induced fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
