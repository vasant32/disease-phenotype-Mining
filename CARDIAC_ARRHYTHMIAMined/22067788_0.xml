<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Published data on the safety of digoxin in abortion care are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with historical controls at a large family planning center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the records of patients at 18 to 24 weeks' gestation who received digoxin before D&amp;E from May 15, 2007 (date the center initiated digoxin use), through March 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed the records of patients who presented for D&amp;E without digoxin from February 22, 2006, through May 12, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the rates of immediate complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 566 digoxin patients and 513 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> occurred in the digoxin cohort; none occurred among controls (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found 19 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the digoxin cohort and three among controls (odds ratio 5.91; 95% confidence interval 1.74-20.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven digoxin patients were admitted to a hospital after the preoperative visit; no controls were admitted (p&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received digoxin before D&amp;E were more likely to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and hospital admission than controls who underwent D&amp;E without digoxin </plain></SENT>
