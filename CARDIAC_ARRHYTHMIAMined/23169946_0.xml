<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role hormone therapy plays in AF is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Women's Health Initiative randomized postmenopausal women to placebo or conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> (0.625 mg/d) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6716">medroxyprogesterone acetate</z:chebi> (2.5 mg/d) if they had a uterus (N=16 608) or to conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> only if they had prior hysterectomy (N=10 739) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident AF was identified by ECG and diagnosis codes from Medicare claims or hospitalization records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for incident AF were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding participants with baseline AF, there were 611 incident AF cases over a mean of 5.6 years among 16 128 estrogen plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> participants, and 683 cases over a mean of 7.1 years among 10 251 conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> alone participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident AF was more frequent in the active groups of both trials, reaching statistical significance in the trial of conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> alone in women with prior hysterectomy (hazard ratio, 1.17; CI, 1.00-1.36; P=0.045) and in the pooled analysis (hazard ratio, 1.12; CI, 1.00-1.24; P=0.05), but not in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> trial (hazard ratio, 1.07; CI, 0.91-1.25; P=0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were only minimally affected by adjustment for incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incident AF was modestly elevated in hysterectomized women randomized to postmenopausal E-alone, and in the pooled group randomized to E-alone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
