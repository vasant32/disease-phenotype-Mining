<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A long-sought, and thus far elusive, goal has been to develop drugs to manage diseases of excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such disease that affects millions each year is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which occurs when electrical impulses in the heart become disordered, sometimes causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> has failed because it is not possible to predict how drugs that target cardiac ion channels, and have intrinsically complex dynamic interactions with ion channels, will alter the emergent electrical behavior generated in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we applied a computational model, which was informed and validated by experimental data, that defined key measurable parameters necessary to simulate the interaction kinetics of the anti-arrhythmic drugs flecainide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> with cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then used the model to predict the effects of these drugs on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human ventricular cellular and tissue electrical activity in the setting of a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> trigger, spontaneous ventricular ectopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model forecasts the clinically relevant concentrations at which flecainide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments in rabbit hearts and simulations in human ventricles based on magnetic resonance images validated the model predictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This computational framework initiates the first steps toward development of a virtual drug-screening system that models drug-channel interactions and predicts the effects of drugs on emergent electrical activity in the heart </plain></SENT>
