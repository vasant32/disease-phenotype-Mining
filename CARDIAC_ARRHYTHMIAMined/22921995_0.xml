<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a growing clinical need for MRI, without an acceptable alternative imaging modality in many patients with cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of MRI at 1.5 T for patients with cardiac devices by measuring the frequency of device failures and clinically relevant device parameter changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from a single-center retrospective review of 109 patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (the MRI group) who underwent 125 clinically indicated MRI studies were compared to data from a prospective cohort of 50 patients with cardiac devices who did not undergo MRI (the control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the MRI group, there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, device failures requiring generator or lead replacement, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, losses of capture, or electrical reset episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decreases in battery voltage of ≥0.04 V occurred in 4%, pacing threshold increases of ≥0.5 V in 3%, and pacing lead impedance changes of ≥50 Ω in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were statistically significant differences between the MRI and control groups for the mean change in pacing lead impedance (-6.2 ± 23.9 vs 3.0 ± 22.1 Ω) and left ventricular pacing threshold (-0.1 ± 0.3 vs 0.1 ± 0.2 V), these differences were not clinically important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, MRI in patients with cardiac devices resulted in no device or lead failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small number of clinically relevant changes in device parameter measurements were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these changes were similar to those in a control group of patients who did not undergo MRI </plain></SENT>
