<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of QTc(max) and QTc dispersion are risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compares the changes of QT parameters before hemodialysis, after hemodialysis, and after renal transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient candidates for renal transplant were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean serum electrolyte and 12-lead electrocardiogram were recorded (1) immediately, (2) before and, (3) after the last dialysis session before renal transplant, (4) and 2 weeks after a kidney transplant in 34 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> graft function (plasma Cr ≤ 176.8 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each QT interval was corrected for the patient's heart rate using Bazett's formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QT parameters (QTd, QTcd, QTc(max)) were compared between prehemodialysis, posthemodialysis, and 2 weeks after renal transplant using a paired t test and a general liner model repeated measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correlation between QT parameter changes and serum electrolyte and acidbase alternation was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The corrected maximal QT interval (QTc(max)) decreased significantly after successful renal transplant compared to prehemodialysis (P = .002) and posthemodialysis (P = .003) with a paired t test and a General Liner Model Repeated Measure (P &lt; .001) between the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the mean of QTc(max) decreased significantly after renal transplant (P = .001) compared to what it was before hemodialysis and after hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation (r= -0.37) between reduction of QTc(max) and serum Ca level (P = .01) in postrenal transplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplant with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> graft function decrease QTc(max) compared to prehemodialysis and posthemodialysis that may correlate with normalization of electrolytes from the uremic state of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney function </plain></SENT>
