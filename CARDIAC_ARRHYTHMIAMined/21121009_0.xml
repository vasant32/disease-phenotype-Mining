<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Voltammograms in Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer exhibited one well-defined and two merged reduction peaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of different buffers, electrolytes, pH, scan rates, and concentration of the drug on cathodic peak current was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of electrochemical behaviour of nicorandil, a direct square-wave voltammetric procedure for quantitation of nicorandil has been developed and validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed square-wave voltammetric method allows quantitation over the range 12.5-62.5 µg mL(-1) with correlation coefficient of 0.992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The limit of quantification and limit of detection were 21.95 µg mL(-1) and 6.58 µg mL(-1) , respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Precision and accuracy were also checked and found within limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The developed square-wave method has also been successfully applied for the determination of nicorandil in pharmaceutical formulations </plain></SENT>
