<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> in patients with a primary PCI-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> complicated by symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 61 patients developing clinical signs of HF within 48 h after a primary PCI-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> (including cardiogenic shock) were randomized double-blind to a 25 h infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was change in wall motion score index (WMSI) from baseline to day 5 measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly larger improvement in WMSI from baseline to day 5 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> group compared with placebo (from 1.94 ± 0.20 to 1.66 ± 0.31 vs. 1.99 ± 0.22 to 1.83 ± 0.26, respectively, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> during study drug infusion in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> group (67% vs. 36%, P = 0.029), but no significant difference in blood pressure at the end of infusion or in use of vasopressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant between-group differences in changes in NT-proBNP levels, clinical composite score, frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size at 6 weeks, or new clinical events up to 6 months were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One and four patients died in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">levosimendan</z:chebi> and placebo group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50567">Levosimendan</z:chebi> treatment improved contractility in post-ischaemic myocardium in patients with PCI-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> complicated by HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment was well tolerated, without any increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>.Trial registration: NCT00324766 </plain></SENT>
