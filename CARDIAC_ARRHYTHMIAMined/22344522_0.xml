<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria for stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> have recently been updated with the time and probability of the event being considered as crucial parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To be considered as "definite", the diagnosis of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has to be confirmed by angiography or histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This statement position has clearly rendered more difficult the clinical assessment of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in randomised clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Considering these limitations, stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> represents a dramatic complication for both patients and cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In coronary plaques, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, the pharmacological improvement of this outcome represents a "hot-topic" field for research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among several medications, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> have been shown to potentially reduce the incidence of coronary stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, randomised clinical trials focussing on "definite" diagnosis are still needed to confirm these promising results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in patients implanted with stents in other arteries is largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>-eluting stents (only tested in pigs) have to be evaluated in other animal models and human beings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a clear recommendation on the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> to prevent stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is not available and caution should be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The "pleiotropic" anti-atherosclerotic properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> might represent a crucial investigation field to pathophysiologically clarify the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in stent complications </plain></SENT>
