<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e>, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
