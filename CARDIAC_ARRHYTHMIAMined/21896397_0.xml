<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 58-year-old woman who volunteered to participate in a controlled exposure to concentrated ambient particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty minutes into the exposure, telemetry revealed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exposure was discontinued, and she reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm approximately 2 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No abnormality was evident on the volunteer's laboratory examination or echocardiography that could explain an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Epidemiologic evidence strongly supports a relationship between exposure to air pollutants and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, but population-level data are not directly relevant to the clinical presentation of individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the only case report of an individual suffering an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after exposure to an air pollutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with termination of the particle exposure further supports a causal relationship between the two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Exposure to air pollution, including particulate matter, may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
