<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- A consistent feature of electrophysiological remodeling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is ventricular action potential duration (APD) prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of reverse remodeling on APD during cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has not been determined in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized (1) that CRT may alter APD and (2) that the effect of CRT on APD may be different in patients who exhibit a good hemodynamic response to CRT compared with those with a poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Left ventricular (LV) activation recovery intervals, as a surrogate for APD, were measured from the LV epicardium in 13 patients at day 0, 6 weeks, and 6 months after CRT implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responders to CRT were defined as those demonstrating a ≥15% reduction in LV end-systolic volume at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responder group had a significant reduction in LV activation recovery interval (mean, -13±12 ms; median, -16 ms; interquartile range, -2 to -19 ms) during right ventricular pacing at 6 months (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the nonresponders showed a significant increase in activation recovery interval (mean, +22 ms±16; median, 17 ms; interquartile range, 8 to 35 ms; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient in each group was on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, LV epicardial APD (activation recovery interval) altered during CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effect on APD was opposite in patients showing a good hemodynamic response compared with nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings may provide an explanation for the persistent high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in some patients with CRT and the additional mortality benefit observed in responders of CRT </plain></SENT>
