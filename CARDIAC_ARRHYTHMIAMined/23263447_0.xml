<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 273 diabetic kidney transplant recipients from 2006 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By protocol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diabetic patients underwent pharmacological radionucleotide stress test or dobutamine stress echocardiography before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the 1-year cardiac outcomes between those with negative stress test results and those with positive stress test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a positive stress test result (n=67) underwent coronary angiogram, and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (â‰¥70% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e>) was found in 35 (52.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the latter, 32 (91.4%) underwent cardiac revascularization (24 underwent cardiac stenting and 8 underwent coronary artery bypass grafting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rest (n=35) were treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within 1 year after transplant, the group with positive stress test results experienced more cardiac events (34.3% vs. 3.9%, P&lt;0.001) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (22.4% vs. 3.4%, P&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (8.9% vs. 0.05%, P=0.001), higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (19.4% vs. 4.8%, P&lt;0.001), and cardiac mortality (17.9% vs. 0.9%, P&lt;0.001) compared with the group with negative stress test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this diabetic population, stress testing showed positive and negative predictive values of 34.3% and 96.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological cardiac stress testing provided excellent risk stratification in diabetic kidney transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
