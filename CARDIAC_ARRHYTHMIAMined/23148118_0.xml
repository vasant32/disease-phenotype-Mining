<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Although complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) are purported to represent critical sites for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) perpetuation, the mechanism and the significance of CFAE in the genesis of AF remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the relationship between CFAE and areas of abnormal atrial tissue defined by low-voltage electrograms (LVE) and signal average of the P-wave (SAPW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Complex fractionated atrial electrogram maps were obtained after pulmonary vein isolation in 15 patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were then cardioverted and voltage/activation maps were acquired in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total left atrium (LA), CFAE and LVE areas were measured as % of total LA area (mean ± SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocities of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, LVE and CFAE areas were also measured during NSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent signal averaged ECG of the P-wave in NSR within 24 h of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complex fractionated atrial electrograms areas accounted for 33 ± 24% of total LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In NSR, only 12 ± 10% of LA area had LVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no anatomic correlation between CFAE sites and LVE; the area of overlap between CFAE and LVE was only 1.6 ± 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity was faster in CFAE areas (2.3 ± 1.4 m/s) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> voltage areas (1.3 ± 0.3 m/s), and LVE areas (1.1 ± 0.7 m/s, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was only found between LVE areas and SAPW duration (r = 0.7, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Areas of CFAEs correspond to areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> atrial voltage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conduction velocity during NSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complex fractionated atrial electrogram probably represents the response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy atrial tissue to rapid pulmonary vein activation </plain></SENT>
