<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their activation increases cardiac performance but can also induce deleterious effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, inhibition of β-adrenoceptors exerts a protective effect in patients with sympathetic over-stimulation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although β(2)-adrenoceptor is not the predominant subtype in the heart, it seems to importantly contribute to the cardiac effects of adrenergic stimulation; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of β(2)-adrenoceptors in the regulation of cardiac contractility, metabolism, cardiomyocyte survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, therapeutic considerations relating to stimulation of the β(2)-adrenoceptor such as an increase in cardiac contractility with low arrythmogenic effect, protection of the myocardium again <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> or positive regulation of heart metabolism are discussed </plain></SENT>
