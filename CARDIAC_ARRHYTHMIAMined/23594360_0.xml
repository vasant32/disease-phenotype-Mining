<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to be beneficial in patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether patients with AF benefit similarly from CRT as their counterparts in sinus rhythm is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a cohort analysis of 175 patients (138 men; age range 57-79 years) who underwent CRT implantation during 2004-2008 in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF was documented in 66 patients (37.7% of patients, 52 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in 1- or 2-year mortality between patients with and without AF (13.6% vs 11.79%, P = 0.7; 25.8% vs 16.9%, P = 0.2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the groups in the rate of complications after CRT implantation or in the rate of appropriate electrical shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of AF patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) (n = 32, 48.5%), the 1-year mortality was 3.1% as compared to 23.5% in AF patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference was no longer evident after 2 years (25.0% vs 26.5%, P = 0.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (15.2%) with AF underwent atrioventricular (AV) node ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 2-year mortality of these patients was 10.0% as compared to 28.6% in AF patients who did not undergo AV-node ablation (P = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no difference in mortality appears to exist between patients with or without AF and who undergo CRT implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings of the beneficial effects of AV-node ablation and CRT-D in AF patients deserve further investigation </plain></SENT>
