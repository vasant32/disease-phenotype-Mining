<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ectopic calcium released from these receptors induces pro-hypertrophic gene expression and may promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that IP(3)RII expression was constitutively restrained by the muscle-specific miRNA, miR-133a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the hypertrophic response to pressure overload or neurohormonal stimuli, miR-133a down-regulation permitted IP(3)RII levels to increase, instigating pro-hypertrophic calcium signaling and concomitant pathological remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that IP(3)-induced calcium release (IICR) initiated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>-associated decrease in miR-133a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this manner, hypertrophic stimuli that engage IICR set a feed-forward mechanism in motion whereby IICR decreased miR-133a expression, further augmenting IP(3)RII levels and therefore pro-hypertrophic calcium release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, IICR can be considered as both an initiating event and a driving force for pathological remodeling </plain></SENT>
