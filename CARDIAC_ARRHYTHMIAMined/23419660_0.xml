<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both pathways have been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), but data are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize the NO-pathway and its relation to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in persistent AF in a sheep model.METHODS AND RESULTS: Persistent AF was induced by rapid atrial pacing for a mean of 136.5 ± 21.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-stimulated sheep served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> phosphate (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase-stimulated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production was significantly increased in the AF group (+51.3 ± 23.2%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there were no changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the different <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase subunits, the increased activity was associated with markedly increased protein expression of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activator, Rac1 (+26 ± 4.6%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity was lower in the AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a marked accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine, a biomarker for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, in atrial tissue of AF animals, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining and dot blot analysis (+15.6 ± 1.8%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of atrial NOS3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was 24.9 ± 4.4% lower in the AF group vs. control (P &lt; 0.05), while NOS1 and 2 were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis revealed no changes in protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">Nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate levels were significantly lower during AF (-24.8 ± 5.8%, P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: In a sheep model of persistent AF, NOS3 transcript levels are attenuated and circulating NOx levels decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Persistent AF is associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, probably resulting from increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity, without major changes in anti-oxidant capacity of the atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
