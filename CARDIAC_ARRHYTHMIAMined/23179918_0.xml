<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) and high dominant frequency sites during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF-HDF) are related to the maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HDF sites in sinus rhythm (SR-HDF; as defined by frequencies of &gt;70 Hz) are suggested to be abnormal atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relations between these electrophysiologic signals have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the relations between SR-HDF and CFAE and AF-HDF sites during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NavX-based maps of CFAE and left atrium (LA)/pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) dominant frequency (DF) during AF and DF maps during SR were created for 23 patients with AF (paroxysmal AF (PAF), n = 14; persistent AF (PerAF), n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The extent of overlap between SR-HDF and CFAE sites was 51 ± 18 % (as calculated by the LA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> segments containing both an SR-HDF site and a CFAE site/total LA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> segments containing an CFAE site) and the extent of overlap between SR-HDF and AF-HDF sites was 50 ± 35 % (P = 0.7464) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, statistically poor agreement was noted for both (kappa values, 0.07 ± 0.19 and 0.08 ± 0.24, P = 0.8794) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of overlap did not differ between PAF and PerAF patients (SR-HDF and CFAE, 52 % (interquartile range (IQR), 42-59) versus 57 % (IQR, 33-67), P = 0.5842; SR-HDF and AF-HDF, 43 % (IQR, 25-85) versus 55 % (IQR, 13-83), P = 0.9465) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bipolar voltage amplitudes of SR-HDF, CFAE, and AF-HDF sites revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> voltage areas (1.6 mV (IQR, 0.8-2.7), 1.9 mV (IQR, 1.1-2.8), and 1.5 mV (IQR, 1.7-2.7), respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In both PAF and PerAF, most CFAE and AF-HDF sites did not correspond to the SR-HDF sites or low-voltage area during SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, most CFAE and DF signals during AF represent functional electrical activities rather than structural remodeling of the atria </plain></SENT>
