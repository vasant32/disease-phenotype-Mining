<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is concentration dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is important for prescribers to consider causes of increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) review of drug interaction and pharmacogenomic studies and discusses pharmacokinetic simulations we performed to develop new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype-guided dosing recommendations for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Pharmacokinetic parameters by CYP2D6 genotype were derived from a published single-dose pharmacogenomic study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We simulated what <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> exposures would result from a multiple-dose scenario in different CYP2D6 genotype groups: extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum dose for poor metabolizers was defined as the dose that would not exceed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> concentrations following 10 mg daily in extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers (the current maximum dose in an unselected population) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dose-ranging analyses revealed that 4 mg daily in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was the maximum dose that would not result in plasma concentrations in excess of those observed in extensive metabolizer and intermediate metabolizer patients receiving 10 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CYP2D6 genotyping is now consequently recommended in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> product label before exceeding 4 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> daily in adults or 0.05 mg/kg/d in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Previously, dose adjustment was recommended every 3 days to achieve the desired clinical response for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The label was modified to subsequently reflect that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days in patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the risk of increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> concentrations and longer time to steady state in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, the FDA has revised the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> label to provide clinicians with clearer dosing, titration, and genotype testing recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The new information is intended to enhance therapeutic individualization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8212">pimozide</z:chebi> in pediatric and adult patients </plain></SENT>
