<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of the short-term (in-hospital) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 72 centres in 10 European countries were asked to enrol 20 consecutive patients scheduled for a first AFib ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between October 2010 and May 2011, 1410 patients were included, of which 1391 underwent an AFib ablation (98.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 60 years [inter-quartile range (IQR) 52-66], and 28% were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds presented paroxysmal AFib and 38% lone AFib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were present in 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The indications for ablation were mostly symptomatic AFib, but in over a third of patients there was also a desire for a drug-free lifestyle and the maintenance of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation was attempted in 98.4% of patients, the roof line in 21.3% and the mitral isthmus line in 12.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complex-fractionated atrial electrograms were targeted in 17.9% and the ganglionated plexi in 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in 7.7%, of which 1.7% was major (i.e. cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, myocardial infraction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median duration of hospitalization was 3 days (IQR 2-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At discharge, 91.4% of patients were in sinus rhythm, 88.3% of patients were given <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, and 67% antiarrhythmic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The AFib Ablation Pilot Study provides crucial information on AF ablation in clinical practice across Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data are relevant for further improvement of the management strategies of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
