<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry has the potential to detect such lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, performing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry during cardiac radiofrequency ablation requires high temporal and spatial resolution and a high signal-to-noise ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a local <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> coil (2-cm diameter) was developed to investigate the feasibility of performing limited field of view <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry with high accuracy and speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The local <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> coil allowed high-resolution (1 × 1 × 3 mm(3) ) image acquisitions in 76.3 ms with a field of view 64 × 32 mm(2) during an open-chest animal experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This represents a 4-fold image acquisition acceleration and an 18-fold field of view reduction compared to that achieved using external <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signal sensitivity achieved using the local coil was over 20 times greater than that achievable using external coils with the same scan parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The local coil configuration provided fewer artifacts and sharper and more stable images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> thermometry can be performed in the heart wall and that lesion formation can be observed during radiofrequency ablation procedures in a canine model </plain></SENT>
