<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the aging, spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) may provide such a model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline ECG recordings were acquired with radiotelemetry in eight young (14-wk-old) and eight aging (55-wk-old) SHRs and in two groups of four age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification of AT and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis were performed based on 24-h ECG recordings in unrestrained rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals were submitted to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> protocol (air-jet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In SHRs, carbamylcholine injections were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous AT episodes were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight aging SHRs (median, 91.5; range, 4-444 episodes/24 h), but not in young SHRs or WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HRV analysis demonstrated significantly decreased low frequency components in aging SHRs compared with age-matched WKY rats (P &lt; 0.01) and decreased low/high frequency ratios in both young (P &lt; 0.01) and aging (P = 0.01) SHRs compared with normotensive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In aging SHRs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> significantly reduced the number of arrhythmic events, whereas carbamylcholine triggered AT and significantly increased atrial electrical instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study reports the occurrence of unprovoked episodes of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in hypertensive rats, and their increased incidence with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> with relative vagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> may be responsible for the increased atrial arrhythmogenicity observed in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also provide evidence that, in this model, the sympatho-vagal imbalance preceded the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that aging SHRs may provide valuable insight into the understanding of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
