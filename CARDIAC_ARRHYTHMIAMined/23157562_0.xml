<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We sought to describe the spectrum of cardiac injury in refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (RSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with RSE between 1999 and 2011 at Mayo Clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RSE was defined as generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000948'>nonconvulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (SE) that continued despite initial therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were age &lt;18 years, anoxic SE, psychogenic SE, simple partial SE, absence SE, and repeat RSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those with (transient left ventricular [LV] dysfunction; electrocardiography [ECG] abnormality-new T-wave inversion, ST elevation or ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, or QTc prolongation; and/or elevated blood troponin T levels) versus those without evidence of cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: We identified 59 consecutive patients with RSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients no cardiac-specific diagnostic studies were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the remaining 35 patients demonstrated markers of cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was necessary for control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 31 of 35 patients for 10.5 Â± 17.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had troponin levels drawn at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SE, of which nine were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ECG findings at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SE included ST elevation (11.4%), ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (5.7%), new T-wave inversion (37.1%), and nonspecific ST changes (37.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (11.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (2.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter (20.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> (48.6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (65.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intervention was required for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 42.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>QTc was prolonged in 22.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient met criteria for non-ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (NSTEMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Three of 14 patients evaluated with ECG during SE demonstrated reversible systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 34.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Outcome was worse in the group with markers of cardiac injury but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Markers of cardiac injury are common in RSE and may be underrecognized in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These disturbances may require specific treatment and are often reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Routine performance of ECG and troponin followed by an echocardiography in those with repolarization abnormalities is probably justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This was a biased sample of patients with severe RSE who had cardiac studies performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of findings in this study refers to this subgroup only </plain></SENT>
