<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In past years, five models of human atrial electrophysiology with different formulations of ionic currents, and consequently diverging properties, have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work is to give an overview of strengths and weaknesses of these models depending on the purpose and the general requirements of simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these models were systematically benchmarked with respect to general mathematical properties and their ability to reproduce certain electrophysiological phenomena, such as action potential (AP) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the models' ability to replicate modified properties of human myocytes and tissue in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, electrical remodeling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (cAF) was chosen as test case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The healthy and remodeled model variants were compared with experimental results in single-cell, 1D and 2D tissue simulations to investigate AP and restitution properties, as well as the initiation of reentrant circuits </plain></SENT>
