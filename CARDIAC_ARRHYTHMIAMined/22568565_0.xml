<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report our 10 year experience with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> use in children with septic shock focusing on doses, routes of administration and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective single-centre review of children with septic shock who received <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> between 2000 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 144 children with septic shock treated with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, in 22% as the first-line drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median volume resuscitation before vasoactive agent administration was 50 mL/kg interquartile range [IQR: 30-70] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean doses of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> ranged from 0.5 ± 0.4 μg/kg per min (starting dose) to 2.5 ± 2.2 μg/kg per min (maximum dose) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">Noradrenaline</z:chebi> was administered via peripheral venous access or intra-osseous route in 19% of cases for a median duration of 3 h [IQR: 2-4] without any adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> increased over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 45% with a significant decrease over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in two children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in eight children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> required treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resolved with the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> dose reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Higher doses of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> than those suggested in the literature may be necessary to reverse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> through peripheral venous access or intra-osseous route was safe, without any adverse effects </plain></SENT>
