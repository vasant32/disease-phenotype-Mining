<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The RSA response pattern was assessed in 23 4- to 7-year-old children diagnosed with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Higher baseline RSA amplitudes were associated with better social behavior (i.e., more conventional gestures, more instances of joint attention) and receptive language abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to reports of typically developing children, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> children with higher RSA amplitude at baseline showed greater RSA and HP reactivity during an attention-demanding task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the importance of studying RSA as a marker of positive function in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
