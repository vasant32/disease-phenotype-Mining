<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> and isolation of H. cinaedi organisms from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myopericarditis</z:e> led us to postulate that H. cinaedi is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> such as atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess any association of H. cinaedi with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, a retrospective case-control study of patients attending Kumamoto University Hospital from 2005 to 2009 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> status of these patients was determined from their electrocardiography and electrophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a comparison of case patients (n= 132) with control subjects (n= 137), H. cinaedi seropositivity was identified as an independent risk factor for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 5.13; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-8.7; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences, however, between these two groups with respect to anti-H. pylori IgG concentrations, anti-Chlamydophila pneumoniae IgG concentrations, and other studied variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgG concentrations against H. cinaedi and H. pylori were inversely correlated, which suggests cross-immunity between these two bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, to explore any association of H. cinaedi with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, immunohistochemical analysis of atherosclerotic aortic tissues collected post mortem from nine patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry of atherosclerotic aortic tissues from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients detected H. cinaedi antigens inside CD68(+) macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of a possible association of H. cinaedi with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
