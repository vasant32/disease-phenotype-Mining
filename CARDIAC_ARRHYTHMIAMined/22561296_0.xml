<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ageing is the major risk factor for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reinforcing the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defence system would be expected to protect the myocardium against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-reperfusion damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reinforcement and ageing on the occurrence of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E, or placebo was administered to 152 patients divided by age: young patients (30-59 years) and old patients (60-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the detection of AF, we used 12-lead and Holter EKGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity was determined in atrial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> was assessed through plasma malondialdehyde levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Supplemented patients over 60 years old showed higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity than control patients in the same age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the supplemented and placebo groups in patients under 60 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the incidence of postoperative AF in supplemented patients was more marked in the older patients than in the younger ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> supplementation with n-3 PUFAs and <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamins C</z:chebi> and E resulted in a more marked reduction of postoperative AF in older patients, it could be suggested that the efficacy of this therapy improves with ageing </plain></SENT>
