<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The impact of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> (sHT) on the cardiovascular system still needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to prospectively assess blood pressure, variability in heart rate, and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with sHT, both before and after they are restored to the euthyroid state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: The study group consisted of 44 normotensive patients (37 women, 7 men), aged 22-65 years (mean±SD: 45.9±11.0) with sHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enrolled patients were drawn from 1080 patients referred to our department for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study patients were treated with radioiodine treatment to restore the euthyroid state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and Holter electrocardiography were performed (1) when sHT was diagnosed and (2) at least 6 months after they became euthyroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: sHT in comparison to euthyroid state was associated with higher (109.3±7.1 vs 107.1±7.7 mmHg) nocturnal systolic mean blood pressure (p=0.035) and blood pressure (BP) load (14.8 vs 10.2 %, p=0.033), mean diastolic BP (66.4±6.6 vs 64.8±6.6 mmHg, p=0.047) and mean arterial pressure (80.8±43.1 vs 79.3±43.6 mmHg, p=0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant changes in both the time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability were observed: decrease of the square root of the mean squared differences of successive NN intervals (rMSSD) - 45.68±34.1 vs 65.09±50.6 ms (p=0.03) and the low frequency power (LF) - 5.71±0.99 vs 6.0±1.01 ms2 (p=0.049) as well as increase of QT interval dispersion - 58.25±28.5 vs 46.90±12.1 ms (p=0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by clinically insignificant increase in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e>) - 3.1±7.4 vs 0.6±1.2 per hour (p=0.048) and increased mean heart rate - 78.4±6.8 vs 76.0±8.0 beats/min (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some of the parameters correlated positively with thyroid hormones: nocturnal diastolic BP with FT3 (r=0.397, p=0.008), rMSSD with FT4 (r=0.389, p=0.013) and QT interval dispersion with FT4 (r=0.450, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The study suggests that sHT in comparison to euthyroid status may be associated with a statistically significant but probably clinically insignificant increase of QT interval dispersion, prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e>, elevated nocturnal arterial BP and changes in heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings broaden our understanding of the cardiovascular effects of sHT </plain></SENT>
