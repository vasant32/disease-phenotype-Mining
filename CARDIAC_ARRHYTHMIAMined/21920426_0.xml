<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4331">Dauricine</z:chebi> (Dau), a bisbenzylisoquinline <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi> from Menispermum dauricum, mainly contributes to the anti-arrhythmic effect and has received pharmacological attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dau can prolong the action potential duration (APD), which has been attributed to its ability to modulate Ca(2+) and several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, its effects on human-<z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The effects of Dau on HERG channels were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record HERG current (I(HERG)) carried by recombinant HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dau inhibited I(HERG) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 3.5 Î¼M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development of block and washout were fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory action of Dau was contingent on channel gating, showing significant voltage and time dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dau inhibited I(HERG) in the open and inactivated states, but not in the closed states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The activation curve was shifted in a negative direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dau inhibits HERG encoded <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels and this action might be a molecular mechanism for the previously reported APD prolongation with this drug </plain></SENT>
