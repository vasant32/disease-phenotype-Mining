<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats fed 2% cholesterol-enriched chow for 8 weeks were subjected to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning (2.4% vol/vol, 1 h) 24 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> was induced by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameters left ventricular developed pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and maximal rise/fall rate of left ventricular pressure were continuously monitored, and myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was determined at the end of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein expression of myocardial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), Bcl-2, and Bad was assessed before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the left ventricular hemodynamic parameters during the whole IR procedure and the myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size did not significantly differ between the normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameters were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markedly improved during the reperfusion period, and the myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was significantly reduced by delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning in normocholesterolemic rats, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these improvements were reversed by N-(3-(aminomethyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22744">benzyl</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38478">acetamidine</z:chebi> (1400W, 1 mg/kg; i.v., 10 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), a selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor, and 5-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27689">decanoate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg, i.v., 10 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-dependent K⁺ channel blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such cardiac improvement induced by delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning did not occur in hypercholesterolemic rats and was not exacerbated by 1400W or 5-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27689">decanoate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of myocardial iNOS was markedly enhanced by delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning in normocholesterolemic, but not in hypercholesterolemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of endothelial NOS and Bad did not differ among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of myocardial phosphorylated endothelial NOS, Bcl-2, and phosphorylated Bad in normocholesterolemic rats was not affected by delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning but was decreased in the hypercholesterolemic control group, and this was not reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>, compared with the normocholesterolemic control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning exerts delayed cardioprotection against IR injury in normocholesterolemic rats, which is blocked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> potentially via interference with the iNOS/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-dependent K⁺ channel pathway </plain></SENT>
