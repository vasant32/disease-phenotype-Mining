<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In this study, we investigated the changes in QT dispersion (QTd) after successful coronary artery revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: QTd, as a marker of regional variability of myocardial repolarization, increases following impaired myocardial perfusion and is associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 45 consecutive patients (mean age 54.39±11.49 years) undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), QTd was measured from a 12-lead electrocardiogram 6-12 hours before and 6 hours after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QTd was defined as the difference between maximum and minimum QT interval in the 12 leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QT changes were analyzed regarding preoperative ejection fraction (EF), type and number of involved vessels, type and number of revascularized coronary arteries and history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Q-wave MI</z:e> using SPSS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QTd significantly decreased postoperatively from 55.48±20.03 to 42.00±19.96 in the study population (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses showed that QTd did not decrease significantly in patients with two-vessel disease and those with low EF (&lt;50%); however, the reduction was significant for other subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Successful PCI results in improved regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of myocardial repolarization, evidenced as decreased QTd after the procedure </plain></SENT>
