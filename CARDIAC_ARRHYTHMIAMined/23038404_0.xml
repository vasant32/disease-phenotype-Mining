<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We distributed surveys to 1,439 subjects from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> research database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 426 subjects completed and returned surveys; 7 of these were from children and were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients who responded were female (63.2%), nonHispanic (88.1%) and white (93.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the total group was 53.2 ± 13.7 years; 82.8% had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> and 32.5% had reached <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, 86.6% were hypertensive with a mean age at diagnosis of 36.9 ± 12.9 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was significantly more prevalent in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 19.6% of the subjects were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 20.8% were smokers, 8.7% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 45.7% had high cholesterol and 17.8% were sedentary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent self-reported cardiovascular events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (25.9%), evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (16.5%), heart valve problems (14.4%), cardiac enlargement (9.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (7.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (6%) and brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> medications were renin-angiotensin inhibitors used by 75% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients and those at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> had a significantly higher incidence of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> patients which contribute to a greater mortality risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADPKD</z:e> population, early diagnosis and clinical intervention are recommended </plain></SENT>
