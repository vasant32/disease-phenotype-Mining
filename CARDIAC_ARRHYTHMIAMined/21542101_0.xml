<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old man underwent an elective coronary bypass graft for severe four-vessel stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiogenic shock developed just after coronary bypass grafting with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending (LAD) artery and superficial venous graft to 1st and 2nd obtuse marginal (OM1/OM2) arteries the posterior descending artery (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) was too small to graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite significant inotropes and an intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient deteriorated in intensive care unit with cardiogenic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Urgent coronary angiography revealed a rupture or torn LIMA graft with extravasation of contrast into the left pleural cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no distal LIMA to LAD flow probably due to graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Revascularisation was performed on the severe ostial native LAD stenosis with a drug eluting stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rupture graft was then stented with a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>-covered stent, which stopped the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and latter, led to total graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient improved significantly and supportive inotropes could be weaned down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 11 month follow-up, the patient had mild left ventricular dysfunction, widely patent ostial LAD stent and thrombosed LIMA graft </plain></SENT>
