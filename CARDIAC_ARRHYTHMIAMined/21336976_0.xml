<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCAs</z:chebi> remain a common cause of fatal drug poisoning because of their cardiovascular toxicity as manifested by electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 15-year-old girl with junctional escape rhythm and resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> caused by severe <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramine</z:chebi> intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial ECG showed junctional escape rhythm (46 bpm) with no atrial activity, low QRS voltage, widening of the QRS complex (160 ms) with a right bundle branch-like pattern, R wave &gt; 3 mm in aVR (6 mm), and prolongation of the QT interval (QTc 550 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite intravenous fluids and inotropic support, she had resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Junctional rhythm was successfully terminated by using temporary cardiac pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were also performed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The conventional methods of activated charcoal, alkalinization, and symptomatic treatment of complications are usually enough for nonlethal doses of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> intoxication </plain></SENT>
