<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) would impact the effect of catheter ablation on persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to compare the effect of catheter ablation on persistent AF with and without a history of PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three patients underwent catheter ablation of persistent AF lasting for &gt; 1 month and were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had a history of PAF or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group I consisted of persistent AF patients with a history of PAF, and group II consisted of persistent AF patients without such a history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received catheter ablation focused on pulmonary vein isolation and were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences, which were defined as documented episodes of AF or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> after a blanking period of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and three patients (60.9%) in group I and sixty-six patients (39.1%) in group II were successfully followed and included in analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in clinical and echocardiographic characteristics between both groups except for a younger age and more male patients in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After (15.5 Â± 10.7) months of follow-up, 59 (57.3%) patients in group I and 49 (74.2%) patients in group II maintained sinus rhythm free of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> drugs (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses found left atrial anteroposterior diameter (P = 0.006) and persistent AF with a history of PAF (OR 1.792, 95%CI 1.019 - 3.152; P = 0.043) as the only independent statistical predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence rate of catheter ablation based on pulmonary vein isolation in persistent AF with a history of PAF was higher than those without a history of PAF </plain></SENT>
