<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- There is a significant variability observed in the conduction properties of the atrioventricular node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a subset of hearts, impulse transmission tends to fall into two distinct conduction regions, termed the slow and fast pathway, and a further subset are capable of dual conduction of a single input stimulus, termed double firing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- In this article, we closely characterize two distinct responses in patients with double firing properties of the atrioventricular node, separating these into discrete types: those with slow and fast pathway interaction and interdependence (interactive), and those with independent pathway properties (orthogonal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We use novel mathematical techniques to evaluate the relative decrement and unique properties of conduction during the overlapping slow and fast pathway conduction zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Our analysis demonstrates two distinct patterns of pathway conduction in double firing patients, termed interactive and orthogonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show parallel overlapping segments of slow and fast pathway decremental conduction curves in interactive pathways, with no such findings with orthogonal conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest anatomic correlates of pathway conduction, with interactive pathways likely having a common distal segment and orthogonal pathways able to independently activate downstream structures </plain></SENT>
