<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein cryoablation (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) is a new approach in the treatment of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) can be used to evaluate the left atrium <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> dimensions to facilitate the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In radiofrequency procedures, some anatomic variants such as common left (CLPV) or right (CRPV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> were reported as factors associated with technical procedure difficulties and potential long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the absence of CLPV as determined by CT would predict better AF-free survival after <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 118 consecutive patients (mean age 56 Â± 10 years; 77% males) with drug refractory paroxysmal (72%)/persistent (28%) AF, with more than 6 months follow-up, who underwent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On CT scanning images performed within 1 month prior to ablation, we evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> anatomic patterns: presence of CLPV or CRPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient was evaluated by 24-hour Holter monitoring within 1 and 3 months and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were periodically evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were asked to record their 12-lead electrocardiogram whenever they experienced symptoms suggestive of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was defined as AF that lasted at least 30 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CLPV was present in 30 (25%) patients and no patients with CRPV were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the end of the 13 months follow-up, patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> had significantly better AF-free survival compared to patients with CLPV (67% vs 50%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference was present in patients with paroxysmal AF (P = 0.008) but not in patients with persistent AF (P = 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing cryoballoon <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation for AF, the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> pattern is associated with better AF-free survival as compared to atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> with CLPV, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
