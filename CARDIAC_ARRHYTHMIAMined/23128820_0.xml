<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> is a life threatening condition that can cause fatal rhythm disturbance and terminal heart arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> in older patients is that of iatrogenic medication-related etiology due to associated polymorbidity, polypharmacy and reduced reserve metabolic capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to increase awareness in the clinicians of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> in elderly patients treated by <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> sparing drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We present two case reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> â‰¥ 9.0 mmol/L induced by <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> sparing medications with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and severe ECG changes including atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp>, disturbance of intraventricular conduction and morphological changes such as tenting T waves and deformed wide QRS complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> in elderly patients are discussed and electrocardiogram changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> are analyzed, as well as their treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">Potassium</z:chebi> sparing drug therapy in older persons requires more frequent monitoring especially when drugs or their doses are changed, or during concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness </plain></SENT>
