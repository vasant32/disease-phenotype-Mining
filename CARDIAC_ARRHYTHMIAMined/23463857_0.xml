<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Slow conduction may promote re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 SCN5A and SCN10A loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in SCN5A with P=1.2×10(-8) (eMERGE) and P=2.5×10(-20) (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in SCN10A with P=6×10(-6) (eMERGE) and P=5×10(-27) (CHARGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other loci were in NFIA, near CDKN1A, and near C6orf204 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phenome-wide association study identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> as the most common associated diagnoses with SCN10A and SCN5A variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCN10A variants were also associated with subsequent development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the original 5272 "heart-healthy" study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants </plain></SENT>
