<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is limited evidence to suggest which subpopulations are at higher risk for MI arising from air pollution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the modifying effects of specific secondary cardiovascular diagnosis (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>) on the relationship between hospital admissions for MI and exposure to ambient air pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital admissions for MI and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 1999-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of hospital admissions for MI was estimated using a case-crossover approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the secondary diagnosis examined showed significant evidence of effect modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It would appear that the correlation between air pollutant exposure and MI occurrence is not affected by predisposing factors present in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
