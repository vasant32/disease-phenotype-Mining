<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that the interval from the peak to the end of the electrocardiographic T wave (Tp-e) may correspond to the transmural dispersion of repolarization and that increased Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio are associated with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate ventricular repolarization by using Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio in patients with AS, and to assess the relation with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with AS and 50 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were measured from a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and the Tp-e interval corrected for heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In electrocardiographic parameters analysis, QT dispersion (QTd) and corrected QTd were significantly increased in AS patients compared to the controls (31.7 ± 9.6 vs 28.2 ± 7.4 and 35.8 ± 11.5 vs 30.6 ± 7.9 ms, P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>cTp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were also significantly higher in AS patients (92.1 ± 10.2 vs 75.8 ± 8.4 and 0.22 ± 0.02 vs 0.19 ± 0.02 ms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P values &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>cTp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were significantly correlated with hsCRP (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.49, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were increased in AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization indexes were significantly correlated with the plasma level of hsCRP </plain></SENT>
