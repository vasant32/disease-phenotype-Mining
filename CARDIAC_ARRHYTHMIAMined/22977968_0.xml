<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The implantable loop recorder (ILR) is an important tool for the evaluation of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, particularly in cases of rarely occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical experience of two Israeli medical centers with the ILR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> evaluated with the ILR at Rabin Medical Center (2006-2010) and Wolfson Medical Center (2000-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study group included 75 patients (44 males) followed for 11.9 +/- 9.5 months after ILR implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' mean age was 64 +/- 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ILR identified an arrhythmic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 20 patients (17 bradyarrhythmias, 3 tachyarrhythmias) and excluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 12, for a diagnostic yield of 42.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was not diagnostic in 17 patients (22.7%) at the time of explant; 26 patients (34.7%) were still in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients ILR results that were initially negative were reversed by later ILR tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmias</z:e> included 9 of 16 (56.3%) with surface electrocardiogram conduction disturbances and 2 of 12 (16.7%) with negative findings on carotid sinus massage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> bradyarrhythmic patients received pacemakers; the seven patients for whom post-intervention data were available had no or mild symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ILR has a high diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-ILR findings correlating with the ILR results are conduction disturbances (positive predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) and negative carotid sinus massage results (negative predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Proper patient instruction is necessary to obtain accurate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Caution is advised when excluding an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on the basis of ILR tracings, and long-term follow-up is warranted </plain></SENT>
