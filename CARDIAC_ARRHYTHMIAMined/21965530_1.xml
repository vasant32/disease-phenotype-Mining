<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left atrial linear ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) may be proarrhythmic, leading to left atrial macro-reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (LAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether due to failure to achieve block initially or to recovery of conduction after ablation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate the frequency of recovery of mitral isthmus (MI) conduction compared with cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) conduction, and the relationship between recovery of MI conduction and postablation LAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 163 patients with AF who underwent circumferential pulmonary vein ablation plus left atrial linear ablation, in whom MI and CTI ablation produced bidirectional conduction block, 52 underwent repeat ablation for recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (AF or LAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 52 patients, coronary sinus ablation was required in 48 to achieve bidirectional MI block at the index ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During repeat ablation, MI and CTI conduction was assessed in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At repeat ablation, MI conduction had recovered in 38 of 52 patients, as compared with CTI conduction which recovered in only 12 of 52 patients (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At repeat ablation, the recurrent clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 12 patients was MI-dependent LAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recovery of MI conduction was associated with development of MI-dependent LAT (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite using bidirectional conduction block as a procedural end point, recovery of MI conduction is common and may lead to LAT after left atrial linear ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reason for greater recovery of MI versus CTI conduction is unknown but could be due to differences in isthmus <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> or lower power used for ablation in the left versus right atrium </plain></SENT>
