<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to stage the atrial remodeling process using the Left Atrial Sphericity (LASP) and determine whether this technique may help to predict AF ablation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance angiography before AF ablation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional reconstruction of LA excluding pulmonary veins and the LA appendage was used to define the LA cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LASP was automatically obtained with self-customized software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 106 patients were included and categorized in 3 groups (Gs): discoid-LA (G1), intermediate-LA (G2), and spherical-LA (G3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The G3 patients had larger LA anteroposterior diameter than G1 and G2 patients (47 ± 7 vs 43 ± 6 and 39 ± 5mm; P &lt; 0.001), greater LA volume (90 ± 39 vs 86 ± 24 and 73 ± 20 mm; P = 0.012), and higher prevalence of persistent AF (75% vs 48% and 29%; P = 0.034) structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (75% vs 19% and 19%; P &lt; 0.001), and AF recurrence at 12 months follow-up (58% vs 29% and 5%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LASP had linear correlation to predicted probability of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified LASP (OR 1.320 [1.096-1.591], P = 0.004) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 3.694 [1.282-10.645]; P = 0.016) as independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left Atrial Sphericity is a new independent predictor of recurrence after AF ablation and may be useful in selecting the best candidates for AF ablation </plain></SENT>
