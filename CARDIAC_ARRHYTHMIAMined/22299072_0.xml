<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Postoperative complications induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>) are described in the neurosurgical literature and mainly involve oxygen venous emboli, postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumocephalus</z:e>; some of them even fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recently there are more and more published case reports for significant cardiac dysrhythmia related to the use of this chemical agent during routine neurosurgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, two-centre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Retrospective review of clinical/radiological documentation (including preoperative medical history, operation report and intraoperative anesthesiology data charts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients scheduled for cranial neurosurgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative occurrence of trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR), according the earlier defined by our group criteria, or other severe cardiovascular complications related to the intraoperative use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five cases were included in the study fulfilling the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the cases were recognized as intraoperative TCR, in the other three cases the cardiovascular effects were possibly due to TCR in one, mechanical stimulation of vital centre in anterior hypothalamus, brainstem, or either mechanical or thermal action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to this two-centre study, we can give, for the first time, evidence that cardiovascular complications according to the intraoperative use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> in neurosurgery are not rare with an incidence of 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Special reference is given to the occurrence of the TCR in this context </plain></SENT>
