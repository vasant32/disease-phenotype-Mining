<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report and literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit at a freestanding tertiary care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: At 7 wks of age, a female infant with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo> was confirmed to have profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> administration for a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">Levothyroxine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thyroid function tests were regularly performed to guide <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thyroid hormone replacement was discontinued after the infant had been off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for 6 mos </plain></SENT>
