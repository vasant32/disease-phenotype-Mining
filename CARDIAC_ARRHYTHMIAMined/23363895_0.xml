<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Objectives: There is increasing evidence linking <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that C-reactive protein (CRP) and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers can predict the recurrence of persistent AF after successful pharmacological cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A possible relationship with AF occurrence was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study design: Using a case-control study design, CRP, catalase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels of 42 patients (23 female, 19 male; mean age 58.4±13.6 years) with documented persistent AF episodes were compared with 21 controls (9 female; 12 male; mean age 58.1±6.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Overall AF patients were followed for 6 months, and 17 showed recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, they were divided into two groups (recurrence and no recurrence) and compared with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CRP, SOD, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in AF patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, only CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with AF recurrence compared to those without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Increased markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> are found in patients with persistent AF, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> may be associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
