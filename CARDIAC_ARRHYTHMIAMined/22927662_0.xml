<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, RF may injure cardiac structures such as the atrio-ventricular node or the right coronary artery and is usually painful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective, randomized study compares cryoablation (Cryo) with RF ablation regarding efficacy, safety, and perceived pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred and fifty-three patients (78 Cryo; 75 RF) with CTI-dependent AFL--median age 65 years (range 34-82), 140 men (91%)--were randomized to Cryo or RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was demonstration of long-term efficacy defined as no symptomatic recurrence of AFL at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation was performed with a 3.5 mm open-irrigated-tip catheter and Cryo with a 9 F, 8 mm tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation endpoint was bidirectional CTI block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate was 92% for Cryo and 95% for RF (P = 0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedural time was longer in the Cryo group (152 ± 54 min) than the RF group (116 ± 41 min) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation was considerably less painful compared with RF (mean VAS-Cryo 0.7 ± 1.2 vs. VAS-RF 4.6 ± 2.0; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Success rate at 6-month follow-up was 93% (73 of 78) for Cryo and 97% (73 of 75) for RF (P = 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No major adverse events occurred in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cryoablation of isthmus-dependent AFL is not inferior to RF but with significantly less procedure-related pain </plain></SENT>
