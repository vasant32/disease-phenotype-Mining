<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B is a multifunctional adapter protein responsible for localization and stabilization of select ion channels, transporters, and signaling molecules in excitable cells including cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B dysfunction has been linked with highly penetrant sinoatrial node (SAN) dysfunction and increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While previous studies have identified a role for <z:mp ids='MP_0001765'>abnormal ion homeostasis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the molecular mechanisms responsible for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and SAN dysfunction in human patients with ankyrin-B syndrome are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we develop a computational model of ankyrin-B dysfunction in atrial and SAN cells and tissue to determine the mechanism for increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and SAN dysfunction in human patients with ankyrin-B syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our simulations predict that defective membrane targeting of the voltage-gated L-type Ca(2+) channel Ca(v)1.3 leads to action potential shortening that reduces the critical atrial tissue mass needed to sustain reentrant activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In parallel, increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> results in conduction slowing that further increases the susceptibility to sustained reentry in the setting of ankyrin-B dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SAN cells, loss of Ca(v)1.3 slows spontaneous pacemaking activity, while defects in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ATPase increase variability in SAN cell firing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, simulations of the intact SAN reveal a shift in primary pacemaker site, SAN exit block, and even SAN failure in ankyrin-B-deficient tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies identify the mechanism for increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and SAN dysfunction in human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, ankyrin-B dysfunction involves changes at both the cell and tissue level that favor the common manifestation of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and SAN dysfunction </plain></SENT>
