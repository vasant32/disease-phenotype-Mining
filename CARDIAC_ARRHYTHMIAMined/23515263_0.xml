<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Pulmonary vein isolation is the most prevalent approach for catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term success of the procedure is diminished by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences occurring predominantly because of reconnections in previously isolated pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the EFFICAS I multicenter study was to demonstrate the correlation between contact force (CF) parameters during initial procedure and the incidence of isolation gaps (gap) at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method and Results- A radiofrequency ablation catheter with integrated CF sensor (TactiCath, Endosense, Geneva, Switzerland) was used to perform pulmonary vein isolation in 46 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the ablation procedure, the operator was blinded to CF information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, an interventional diagnostic procedure was performed to assess gap location as correlated to index procedure ablation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 65% (26/40) of patients showed â‰¥1 gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablations with minimum Force-Time Integral (FTI) &lt;400 gs showed increased likelihood for reconnection (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reconnection correlated strongly with minimum CF (P&lt;0.0001) and minimum FTI (P=0.0007) at the site of gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gap occurrence showed a strong trend with lower average CF and average FTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CF and FTI are generally higher on the right side, although the left anterior segment presents a unique challenge to achieve stable position with good CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Minimum CF and minimum FTI values are strong predictors of gap formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Optimal CF parameter recommendations are a target CF of 20 g and a minimum FTI of 400 gs for each new lesion </plain></SENT>
