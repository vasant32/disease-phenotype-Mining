<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Progressive familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> type I (PFHBI) is a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> characterized by progressive conduction disturbances in the His-Purkinje system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PFHBI has been linked to genes such as SCN5A that influence cardiac excitability but not to genes that influence cell-to-cell communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to explore whether nucleotide substitutions in genes coding for connexin proteins would associate with clinical cases of PFHBI and if so, to establish a genotype-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> correlation for that mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened 156 probands with PFHBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to 12 sodium channel mutations, we found a germ line GJA5 (connexin40 [Cx40]) mutation (Q58L) in 1 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterologous expression of Cx40-Q58L in connexin-deficient <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells resulted in marked reduction of junctional conductance (Cx40-<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> [WT], 22.2±1.7 nS, n=14; Cx40-Q58L, 0.56±0.34 nS, n=14; P&lt;0.001) and diffuse localization of immunoreactive proteins in the vicinity of the plasma membrane without formation of gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heteromeric cotransfection of Cx40-WT and Cx40-Q58L resulted in homogenous distribution of proteins in the plasma membrane rather than in membrane plaques in ≈50% of cells; well-defined gap junctions were observed in other cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Junctional conductance values correlated with the distribution of gap junction plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutation Cx40-Q58L impairs gap junction formation at cell-cell interfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of a germ line mutation in a connexin gene that associates with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and emphasizes the importance of Cx40 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> propagation in the specialized conduction system </plain></SENT>
