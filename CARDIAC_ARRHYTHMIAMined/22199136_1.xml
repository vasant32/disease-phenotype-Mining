<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to estimate the effect of ASV on 1-year prognosis in HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: After optimizing medical therapy, a 1-year follow-up study was conducted of 85 HF patients (mean age, 72 ± 10 years; 46 men), categorized as New York Heart Association class II-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into 2 groups based on adherence to ASV therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of ASV for ≥ 4h/night was designated as good adherence, and use of ASV for &lt;4h/night was designated as poor adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of fatal cardiovascular events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from progression of HF, cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> was tracked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven patients were classified into the good adherence group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 1-year follow-up, the survival rate calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis was significantly higher in the good adherence group than in the poor adherence group (P=0.0046, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of fatal cardiovascular events was 0.53 (0.27-0.99) for the good ASV adherence group (P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ASV prevents fatal cardiovascular events and improves survival in HF patients </plain></SENT>
