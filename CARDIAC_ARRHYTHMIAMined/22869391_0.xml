<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduction in renal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> spillover could be achieved after renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between RSD and AF is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the inducibility of AF during atrial rapid pacing after RSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen dogs were used for the study as follows: control group (seven dogs) and RSD group (six dogs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, dogs were subjected to atrial pacing at 800 beats/min for 7 h, and atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured every hour in the status of non-pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, pacing was stopped and the burst pacing (500 bpm) was repeated to induce AF three times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the RSD group, after each renal artery ablation, the procedure of pacing and electrophysiological measurement was exactly same as in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected before and after pacing to measure the levels of renin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a persistent decrease in AERP in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 7 h after cessation of pacing, the induced number of times and duration of AF were higher in the control group than that in the RSD group (1.0 ± 1.26 vs 3.14 ± 2.54, P = 0.03; 16.5 ± 25.1 vs 86.6 ± 116.4, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> concentration increased significantly 7 h after rapid pacing in control group (renin, 119.8 ± 31.1 vs 185.3 ± 103.5 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.01; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>, 288.2 ± 43.1 vs 369.6 ± 109.8 pg/ml, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The levels of renin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> showed a decreasing trend in RSD group, but this did not attain statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Episodes of AF could be decreased by renal sympathetic denervation during short-time rapid atrial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This effect might have relationship with decreased activity of RAAS </plain></SENT>
