<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have been performed in human beings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some of them are only descriptive, and controls were usually <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts; thus, differences between cases and controls could be related to the underlying disease rather than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We quantified by histomorphometry the above characteristics in nine samples (three from the left atrium, three from around fat pads, one from the right atrium, one from the cavum-tricuspid isthmus, and one from the ventricular septum) from 13 necropsy hearts of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and compared the findings with those from 13 control cases with the same diseases but without any atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> linear mixed model for repeated measures, with significance defined as P â‰¤.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (estimated as collagen/(collagen+myocardium) ratio-0.26 vs. 0.23, P=.35), the presence of disconnections (70.1 vs. 61.5, P=.09), abrupt turns (43.6 vs. 45.3, P=.84), or epicardial reflections (9.4 vs. 14.5, P=.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only difference identified was that cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> exhibited fewer crossings than those without (79.5 vs. 91.5, P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, alterations in myocardial fiber continuity, including <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, seem to reflect a generalized myocardial disorganization of the atria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> but are not specifically related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
