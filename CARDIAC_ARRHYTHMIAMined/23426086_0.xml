<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to assess whether the coexistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and LVH is independently associated with the rate of renal function decline and increased cardiovascular events in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: This longitudinal study enrolled 415 patients, who were classified into 4 groups according to sex-specific median values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and with/without LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change in renal function was measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, hospitalization for unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> attack, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of cardiovascular events was analyzed by Cox's regression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was significantly lower in the group with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and LVH than in the other groups (P â‰¤ 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and LVH were independently associated with increased cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 4.269; 95% confidence interval, 1.402-13.000; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings showed that the coexistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and LVH was independently associated with faster renal function decline and poor cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Assessments of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and LVH by echocardiography may help identify a high-risk group of poor renal and cardiovascular prognosis in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 </plain></SENT>
