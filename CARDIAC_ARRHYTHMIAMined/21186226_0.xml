<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study anterograde atrioventricular (A-V) nodal electrophysiological properties through the right-atrial (Ri) and left-atrial inputs (Li) under the pharmacological autonomic blockade (AUB) in patients with slow-fast A-V nodal re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with slow-fast AVNRT and 15 control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Programmed stimulation with single extrastimulus was performed from the right atrial appendage to test the Ri, and from the posterolateral coronary sinus to test the Li </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AUB was induced with intravenous <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (0.04 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (0.15 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The A-V nodal conduction times, refractoriness, discontinuous conduction (â‰¥ 40 ms atrial-His interval 'jump'), and inducibility of AVNRT or reciprocating beats were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The A-V nodal conduction times were longer: (i) through the Ri than Li, (ii) in patients than controls, and (iii) in baseline than after AUB--at slow rates in both groups and at fast rates in patients through the right input only (P &lt; 0.05-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly longer slow pathway effective refractory period was demonstrated through the Li than the Ri in patients in baseline (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The discontinuous conduction was demonstrated 94 times in 25 of 29 (83%) patients and 15 times in 6 of 15 (40%) controls (P &lt; 0.01), and was most frequently encountered with the Ri testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, inducibility was manifested most frequently with the Ri testing (P = 0.08), and decreased after AUB during this testing only (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inherent magnitude of discordance of A-V nodal conduction velocity, refractoriness, and parasympathetic modulation between the Ri and Li to the A-V node may play a role in the aetiology of AVNRT </plain></SENT>
