<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the failure-free survival rates of the Durata™ compared with the Riata™ and Sprint Quattro™ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads.METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n = 2475) implanted with a Durata (n = 828), Riata [n = 627; 8 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(n = 472) and 7 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(n = 155)], or Sprint Quattro (n = 1020) leads at our institution were included and Kaplan-Meier failure-free survival curves were constructed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lead failure was defined as electrical malfunction resulting in lead replacement, excluding dislodgements or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Annual electrical failure rates were 0.3%, 1.7, and 0.3% for the Durata, Riata, and Sprint Quattro leads, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001 for the comparison of Durata to Riata and P = 0.1.0 for the comparison of Durata to Sprint Quattro) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The failure-free survival of the Durata lead was significantly better than that of the Riata lead (P &lt; 0.0001) and similar to that of the Sprint Quattro (P = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 7 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Riata ST lead had better survival compared with the 8 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Riata lead (P = 0.050) and comparable survival with the Durata lead (P = 0.12).CONCLUSION: The Durata lead failure-free survival is significantly better than the 8 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Riata, albeit at a shorter follow-up time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Riata and comparable with that of the 7 Fr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Riata ST and the Sprint Quattro <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data provide an insight into the mechanism of electrical failure of Riata leads and have implications for patient management </plain></SENT>
