<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of cardiac <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scintigraphy to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) listed for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) devices as primary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: A prospective cohort study in 27 patients with HF referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (alone or in combination with cardiac resynchronisation therapy) at a tertiary cardiac centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiac (123)I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed with calculation of early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H:M) ratios, washout rate, and summed defect score from single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT using (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin was also performed and a summed score calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Innervation-perfusion mismatch was evaluated by comparing SPECT scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> requiring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 16 months median follow-up, 10 (37%) patients experienced a significant arrhythmic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients who suffered no event, these individuals had lower early and late H:M ratio and higher (123)I-MIBG SPECT defect scores: 1.83 ± 0.43 versus 2.34 ± 0.33 (p&lt;0.001); 1.54 ± 0.38 versus 1.96 ± 0.38 (p=0.005); 37.0 ± 9.4 versus 25.5 ± 7.7 (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mismatch scores were also higher: 18.5 ± 8.5 versus 8.4 ± 5.0 (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimal thresholds for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were &lt;1.94 for early H:M ratio (sensitivity 70%, specificity 88%); &lt;1.54 for late H:M ratio (sensitivity 60%, specificity 88%); (123)I-MIBG SPECT defect score ≥31 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In HF patients without prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, (123)I-MIBG imaging strongly predicts future arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may inform the process of case selection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy on an individual basis, although no single measurement provides sufficient reassurance to obviate device implantation if otherwise clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
