<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) followed by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the outcomes of those who underwent isolated CABG without carotid intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, conducted between March 2007 and February 2010, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had significant carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;70%) and were candidates for CABG were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures, including 30-day post-stenting complications, cardiac surgery neurological complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), and mortality rates, were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 112 patients underwent CABG without carotid artery intervention and 62 patients were scheduled for CAS + CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates in the CAS + CABG patients and isolated CABG group were 9.7% and 6.3%, respectively (P=.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CAS + CABG group, 4 patients (6.4%) were complicated by ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2 (3.2%) by MI, and 3 (4.8%) by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> had neurological causes and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> had a cardiac cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the isolated CABG group, 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases (3.6%) were diagnosed in the postoperative period, 2 of them (1.8%) being ipsilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, 1 MI case (0.9%) and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (3.6%) occurred after cardiac surgery; 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> had neurological causes and the remaining 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> resulted from other postoperative complications (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinitis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the isolated CABG approach in patients with concomitant coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is small, and there is no evidence that this risk is lessened by prophylactic CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Staged CAS + CABG may become the preferred option in patients with symptomatic bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with stable cardiac status if it is conducted in a high-volume center by experienced operators </plain></SENT>
