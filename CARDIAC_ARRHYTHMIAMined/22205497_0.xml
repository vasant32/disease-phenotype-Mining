<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although sites of complex fractionated electrograms (CFAEs) and dominant frequency (DF) are known to be critical for the maintenance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), spatial distribution of CFAEs and DF and their impact on the outcome of AF ablation remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We created CFAE and DF maps of the left atrium (LA), right atrium, and pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) with a NavX mapping system and simultaneously calculated the DF values with a Bard LabSystem Pro in 40 patients with AF (nonparoxysmal, n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 19 patients in whom circumferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (CPVI) terminated AF, there was a high DF in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (Bard-based DF value, 6.70 ± 1.01 Hz), low DF in the LA body (5.94 ± 0.75 Hz), and a significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-to-LA body DF gradient (0.76 ± 0.65 Hz), and the CFAEs were located mainly in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> antrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 21 patients not responding to CPVI, a high DF was located in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (7.04 ± 0.81 Hz) and LA body (6.75 ± 0.81 Hz), and therefore, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-to-LA body DF gradient was smaller than that in the CPVI responders (0.29 ± 0.52 Hz, P = 0.0160), and the CFAEs extended to the LA body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The higher DF in the LA body, nonparoxysmal AF, and longer AF duration remained as independent predictors of a post-ablation AF recurrence by using a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A higher LA-DF value, smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>-to-LA DF gradient, and wider LA-CFAE distribution were noted more often in the nonresponders to CPVI than in the responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggested the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate in the LA beyond the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in patients whose AF persisted after CPVI, which was further associated with post-ablation AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
