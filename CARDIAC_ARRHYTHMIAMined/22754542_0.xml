<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For over a century, the role of the parasympathetics via vagal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> release was related to controlling primarily heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although in the late 1800s shown to play a role in atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the myocardium took precedence from the mid-1950s until in the last decade a resurgence of interest in the autonomics along with signaling cascades, regulators, and ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Originally ignored as being benign and thus untreated, recent emphasis has focused on atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> seen by the general practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is now recognized to have significant mortality and morbidity due to resultant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the aging population, there will be an unprecedented increased burden on health care resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although it has been known for more than half a century that cholinergic stimulation can initiate AF, the classical concept focused on the M2 receptor and its signaling cascade including RGS4, as these had been shown to have predominant effects on nodal function (heart rate and conduction block) as well as contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence suggests that the M3 receptor may also playa role in initiation and perpetuation of AF and thus RGS2, a putative regulator of the M3 receptor, may be a target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking RGS2 (RGS2(-/-)), were found to have significantly altered electrophysiological atrial responses and were more susceptible to electrically induced AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vagally induced or programmed stimulation-induced AF could be blocked by the selective M3R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, darifenacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a potential surgical target (ICANS) and pharmacological targets (M3R, RGS2) for the management of AF </plain></SENT>
