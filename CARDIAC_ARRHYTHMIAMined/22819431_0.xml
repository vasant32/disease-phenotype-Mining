<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify electrocardiographic tools to differentiate the "malignant" form of ERP from benign ERP in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively assessed the prevalence of ERP by recording electrocardiograms in 1,161 southwestern French subjects 35 to 64 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ERP was defined by an elevation of the J point ≥1 mm in 2 consecutive leads excluding leads V(1) through V(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We categorized ERP as notching or slurring pattern as located in inferior and/or lateral leads and measured the J-point elevation amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ST segment after ERP was categorized as ascendant or horizontal/nonascendant and T waves as negative or positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Association of ERP with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortalities was assessed by adjusted Cox proportional hazard models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ERP was found in 157 subjects (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 14.2 ± 2 years, 77 subjects died (6.6%), of whom 24 (2.1%) died from cardiovascular causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ERP had an increased hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44 to 4.15, p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (5.60, 95% CI 2.27 to 11.8, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest risk was found for notching ERP and ERP with a nonascendant/horizontal ST segment, yielding when associated increased hazard ratios of 3.84 (95% CI 2.14 to 6.92, p = 0.001) and 8.75 (95% CI 3.48 to 22.0, p = 0.001) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a slurring ERP or ascendant ST segment was not associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ERP localization, J-point elevation amplitude, or T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> did not distinguish benign from malignant forms of ERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ERP with notching pattern and horizontal/descendant ST segments was associated with the highest risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These electrocardiographic patterns may be used for risk stratification in subjects with ERP </plain></SENT>
