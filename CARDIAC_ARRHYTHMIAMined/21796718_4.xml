<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine the association between exposure to antidepressants and emergency department or inpatient admission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (SD/VA), and to examine the impact of dose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using 1999-2003 Medicaid claims data from beneficiaries of five large states, supplemented with Medicare claims for dually eligible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposures were prescription claims for antidepressants of interest or a reference antidepressant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were incident first-listed emergency department or principal inpatient diagnoses indicative of SD/VA originating in the outpatient setting, an outcome previously found to have a positive predictive value of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1.3 million person-years of antidepressant exposure, we identified 4222 SD/VA outcomes for a rate of 3.3/1000 person-years (95%CI, 3.2-3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> (a referent with a putatively favorable cardiovascular risk profile), adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.80 (0.67-0.95) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi>, 1.24 (0.93-1.65) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4710">doxepin</z:chebi>, 0.79 (0.55-1.15) for <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>, and 1.26 (1.11-1.42) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6950">mirtazapine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRs for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7494">nefazodone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7640">nortriptyline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9654">trazodone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi> were near unity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For antidepressants having nonnull risks (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3219">bupropion</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6950">mirtazapine</z:chebi>), we observed no relationship with antidepressant dose and some relationships with concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of antidepressants studied, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6950">mirtazapine</z:chebi> had a statistically significantly greater SD/VA risk versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, baseline differences between these users suggest that this finding may be attributable to residual confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven other antidepressants had SD/VA risks no greater than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi>, thereby providing reassurance regarding the comparative cardiovascular safety of antidepressants </plain></SENT>
