<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined that fractures are associated with significant consequences, particularly during the first month postfracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing longevity, patients with SCI have a substantial number of illnesses and comorbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lower extremity fractures are frequent events in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, whether these fractures are associated with any increased risk of complications in SCI is not certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report was to determine the impact of lower extremity fractures on morbidities in men with SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based, nested, case-control (1,027 cases and 1,027 propensity-matched controls) of men enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Spinal Cord Dysfunction Registry from fiscal years 2002 to 2007 was reviewed to determine whether lower extremity fractures were associated with an increased risk for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In propensity score models matched for demographic (age, race) and SCI-related injury factors (level/completeness of SCI), Veterans Affairs-service connection status, and comorbidities, at 1 month following the fracture, there was an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infections</z:hpo>, pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> (p ≤ 0.03 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over 12 months, the only complication more common in fracture cases was pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (p &lt; 0.01), with an absolute difference of less than 2 % when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> at any time examined following fracture (≥0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity fractures are associated with significant consequences in men with SCI during the first month postfracture, but they do not persist for a long term, except for pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Targeted interventions to prevent complications should be considered following lower extremity fractures in SCI, particularly in the first month following fracture </plain></SENT>
