<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of neferine, an effective anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> drug isolated from the embryo of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner's seeds, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In groups 1 and 2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was given to rats by intragastric and intravenous administration, respectively, while neferine was co-administratered by intragastric administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at indicated time points and were analyzed for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> concentration using RP-HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The geometric mean ratio for C(max) and AUC(0-96) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetics parameters of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> administered intravenously or intragastrically and the control (without neferine) group (with ratios of 0.7-1.4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental groups), suggesting that neferine had no effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> plasma pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dosage regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> does not need to be taken into consideration when combined with neferine </plain></SENT>
