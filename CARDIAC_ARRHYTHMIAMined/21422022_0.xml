<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Device automaticity may alleviate the follow-up burden by minimizing the time for physician involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the prospective, multicentre AUTOMATICITY registry was to examine the performance of a subset of programmed automatic algorithms during patient follow-up and their acceptance by implanting physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical use of automatic algorithms from the Insignia pacemakers (PM; Boston Scientific, St Paul, MN, USA) was evaluated: atrial and ventricular AutoSense (sensitivity adjustment), ventricular Automatic Capture (threshold verification and output setting), AutoLifeStyle (sensor settings adjustment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to assess the reprogramming rates within 12 months of implant, the reasons for reprogramming and relationship to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 960 patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients free from any algorithm reprogramming at 12 months was 86.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 2736 algorithms were activated at enrolment, with 156 (5.7%) being reprogrammed in 115 patients at 12 months for any reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine reprogrammings (1.8%) were unintentional or related to changes in device settings such that the algorithm was no longer available, 33 (1.2%) were due to suspected sensing issues, and 22 (0.8%) were assumed related to the algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The individual 12-month reprogramming-free rates were: ventricular AutoSense 94.3%, Atrial AutoSense 93.3%, AutoLifeStyle 93.9%, and Automatic Capture 95.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the AUTOMATICITY registry show that automatic measurement of key settings and automatic adjustment to optimal programming is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The simplicity of PM follow-up and avoidance of frequent reprogramming may contribute to a more effective use of hospital time and resources </plain></SENT>
