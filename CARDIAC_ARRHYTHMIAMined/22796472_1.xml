<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a novel adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy ((aCRT) algorithm for CRT pacing that provides automatic ambulatory selection between synchronized left ventricular or BiV pacing with dynamic optimization of atrioventricular and interventricular delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 522) indicated for a CRT-defibrillator were randomized to aCRT vs echo-optimized BiV pacing (Echo) in a 2:1 ratio and followed at 1-, 3-, and 6-month postrandomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 noninferiority primary objectives: (1) the percentage of aCRT patients who improved in their clinical composite score at 6 months was at least as high in the aCRT arm as in the Echo arm (73.6% vs 72.5%, with a noninferiority margin of 12%; P = .0007); (2) aCRT and echo-optimized settings resulted in similar cardiac performance, as demonstrated by a high concordance correlation coefficient between aortic velocity time integrals at aCRT and Echo settings at randomization (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94) and at 6-month postrandomization (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.87-0.92); and (3) aCRT did not result in inappropriate device settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the arms with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points showed similar benefit, and right-ventricular pacing was reduced by 44% in the aCRT arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aCRT algorithm is safe and at least as effective as BiV pacing with comprehensive echocardiographic optimization </plain></SENT>
