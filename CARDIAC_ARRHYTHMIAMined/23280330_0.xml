<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The components of CHADS(2) score were reported to be important risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the CHADS(2) score was a useful scheme in predicting new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we aimed to use the CHADS(2) scoring system to estimate the individual risk in developing AF for patients with different comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2001, a total of 702,502 patients older than 18years old and who had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were identified from the "National Health Insurance Research Database" released by the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CHADS(2) score was calculated for every patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, 628,807 (score 0), 47,039 (score 1), 15,655 (score 2), 6843 (score 3), 3315 (score 4), 790 (score 5) and 53 (score 6) patients were studied and followed for the occurrences of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a follow-up of 9.0Â±2.2years, there were 9187 (1.3%) patients experiencing new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AF was 1.5 per 1000 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence increased from 0.8 per 1000 patient-years for patients with a CHADS(2) score of 0 to 34.6 per 1000 patient-years for those with a CHADS(2) score of 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After an adjustment for the gender and comorbidities, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of each increment of the CHADS(2) score in predicting AF was 2.342 (2.309-2.375; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CHADS(2) score, consisting of an age &gt;75 and several clinical risk factors was useful in risk estimation and stratification of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
