<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven consecutive patients diagnosed with VSA by a provocation test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> were grouped according to whether they had a J wave in the baseline electrocardiograms or not (VSA-JW group, n = 14; VSA-non-JW group: n = 53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied the associations between J-wave and ST-segment dynamics and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillations</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e>) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e>.  In the VSA-JW group, 7 of the 14 patients showed changes in J-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and/or gains in J-wave voltage, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, the four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> showed similar maximal voltage in the baseline J waves but a higher voltage during induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasms</z:e> (0.57 ± 0.49 vs. 0.30 ± 0.11 mV; P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, J waves progressively increased and were accompanied by the characteristic coved-type or lambda-shaped ST-segment elevations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the VSA-non-JW group, only four patients showed new appearances of J waves during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasms</z:e> and another patient without a distinct J wave developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillations</z:hpo> were induced more frequently in the VSA-JW group than in the VSA-non-JW group [4/14 (29%) vs. 1/53 (2%); P = 0.012] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: J-wave augmentations were caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasms</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence and augmentation of J waves, especially prominent J waves with the characteristic ST-elevation patterns, were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
