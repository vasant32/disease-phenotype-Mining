<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> can further improve angiographic and clinical outcomes compared to SES still remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of zotarolimus-eluting stents (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e>) compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>-eluting stents (SES) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Major electronic information sources were explored for randomized controlled trials comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> with SES among patients undergoing PCI during at least 9months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy outcomes were target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel revascularization (TVR), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE); safety outcomes were stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (ST), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven comparative studies were identified (a total of 5983 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> at 12-month follow-up, SES significantly reduced risk of MACE (relative risk [RR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61 to 0.89, p=0.002), and TLR (RR:0.39; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.52; p&lt;0.00001), without significant differences in terms of TVR (RR:0.68, 95% CI: 0.38 to 1.20; p=0.18), ST (RR:0.71; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.31; p=0.28), cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (RR:0.83; 95% CI: 0.49-1.42, p=0.50) or MI (RR:1.08; 95%CI: 0.80 to 1.45; p=0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At 12-month follow-up, SES are superior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ZES</z:e> in reducing the incidences of TLR and MACE in patients undergoing PCI, without significant differences in terms of TVR, ST, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and MI </plain></SENT>
