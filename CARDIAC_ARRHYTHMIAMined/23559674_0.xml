<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -Because of the technical difficulty with achieving pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation in the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF), novel catheter designs to facilitate the procedure are in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A visually-guided laser ablation (VGLA) catheter was designed to allow the operator to directly visualize target tissue for ablation, and then deliver laser energy to perform point-to-point circumferential ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single center studies have demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the multicenter feasibility, efficacy, and safety of performing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation using the VGLA catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -This study includes the first 200 PAF patients treated with the VGLA catheter (33 operators, 15 centers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After transseptal puncture, the VGLA catheter was used to perform <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrical isolation was assessed using a circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the VGLA catheter, 98.8% (95% CI, 97.8-99.5%) of targeted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> were isolated using a mean of 1.07 catheters/patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy and procedure times were 31±21 (mean±sd) and 200±54 min respectively, and improved with operator experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, atrio-esophageal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> or significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a 2% incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> and 2.5% incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1442879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phrenic nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, the drug-free rate of freedom from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after one or two procedure was 60.2% (95% CI, 52.7-67.4%) CONCLUSIONS: -In this multicenter experience of the first 200 patients treated with the VGLA catheter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation can be achieved in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients using a single VGLA catheter with an efficacy similar to radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
