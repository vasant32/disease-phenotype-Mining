<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) and their relationship to the superior vena cava (SVC) was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phrenic nerve (PN) stimulation was performed during ablation of the right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> with a 28-mm CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The freezing cycle was immediately terminated in case of loss of PN capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-five patients (age, 58 ± 11 years; ejection fraction, 0.59 ± 0.06; left atrial size, 40 ± 5 mm) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No persistent PNP was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient PNP occurred in 4 of 65 patients (6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PN function normalized within 24 h in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A short distance between the right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and the SVC was significantly associated with PNP, but left atrial and 3D <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Low temperature early during the freezing cycle (&lt;-41 °C at 30 s) predicted PNP with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100 and 98 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The anatomical relationship between the right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and the SVC is a preprocedural predictor for the development of transient PNP, and low temperature early during ablation at the right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> is a sensitive warning sign of impending PNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of the 28 mm CB, transient PNP occurred in 6 % of patients undergoing CB ablation </plain></SENT>
