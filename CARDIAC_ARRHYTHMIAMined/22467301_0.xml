<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, Ca(2+) alternans appears as cytosolic Ca(2+) transients of alternating amplitude at regular beating frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac alternans is a multifactorial process but has been linked to disturbances in intracellular Ca(2+) regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In atrial myocytes, we tested the role of voltage-gated Ca(2+) current, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load, and restitution properties of SR Ca(2+) release for the occurrence of pacing-induced Ca(2+) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that peak Ca(2+) current was not affected during alternans, and alternans of end-diastolic SR Ca(2+) load, evaluated by application of <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> or measured directly with an intra-SR fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51105">fluo-5N</z:chebi>), were not a requirement for cytosolic Ca(2+) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restitution properties and kinetics of refractoriness of Ca(2+) release after activation during alternans were evaluated by four different approaches: measurements of 1) the delay (latency) of occurrence of spontaneous global Ca(2+) releases and 2) Ca(2+) spark frequency, both during rest after a large and small alternans Ca(2+) transient; 3) the magnitude of premature action potential-induced Ca(2+) transients after a large and small beat; and 4) the efficacy of a photolytically induced Ca(2+) signal (Ca(2+) uncaging from DM-nitrophen) to trigger additional Ca(2+) release during alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the latency of global spontaneous Ca(2+) release was prolonged and Ca(2+) spark frequency was decreased after the large Ca(2+) transient during alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the restitution curve of the Ca(2+) transient elicited by premature action potentials or by photolysis-induced Ca(2+) release from the SR lagged behind after a large-amplitude transient during alternans compared with the small-amplitude transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that beat-to-beat alternation of the time-dependent restitution properties and refractory kinetics of the SR Ca(2+) release mechanism represents a key mechanism underlying cardiac alternans </plain></SENT>
