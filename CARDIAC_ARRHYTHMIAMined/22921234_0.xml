<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a recently recognized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> (CTD) caused by mutations in transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR)1 and TGFBR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical outcomes of aortic repair in patients with LDS are poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 16 patients with TGFBR mutations identified by gene analysis in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1993 and 2011, they underwent 41 aortic surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (group D: dissection group) underwent aortic repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> as a first surgical intervention, and 6 patients (group N: nondissection group) underwent surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002616'>aortic root dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 103.7 Â± 92.3 months (range, 2- 276 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group N, valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The residual aorta in 9 patients (90%) from group D required further repairs, 3 times on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in 4 patients (40%), the aorta was entirely replaced in serial procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group N, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred in only 1 patient (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aortic event-free rates at 5 years were 40% in group D and 80% in group N, respectively (p = 0.819) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred 1 month after VSRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cumulative survival rates at 5 years were 100% in group D and 83% in group N, respectively (p = 0.197) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical outcomes for patients with LDS were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Once <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> occurred, the aorta expanded rapidly, requiring further operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early surgical intervention may improve prognosis by preventing a fatal aortic event </plain></SENT>
