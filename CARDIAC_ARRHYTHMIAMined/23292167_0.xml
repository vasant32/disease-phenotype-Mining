<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although relatively small in magnitude, the late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (I(NaL)) represents a functionally relevant contributor to cardiomyocyte (electro)<z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many aspects of I(NaL) itself are as yet still unresolved, including its distribution and function in different cell types throughout the heart, and its regulation by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel accessory proteins and intracellular signalling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its complexity is further increased by a close interrelationship with the peak <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current and other ion currents, hindering the development of inhibitors with selective and specific properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased knowledge of the intricacies of the complex nature of I(NaL) during distinct cardiovascular conditions and its potential as a pharmacological target is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide an overview of the functional and electrophysiological effects of late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current inhibition on the level of the ventricular myocyte, and its potential cardioprotective and anti-arrhythmic efficacy in the setting of acquired and inherited ventricular dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
