<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Earlier studies have shown that the slow conduction zone in patients with cavotriscuspid (CTI)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> without prior surgery (NS-AFL) is the CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the location of this slow zone in patients with CTI-dependent flutter and a prior atriotomy has not been formally studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of the slow zone in patients with prior atriotomy and CTI-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (PA-AFL) and comparison with NS-AFL may have important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen consecutive patients with PA-AFL and 17 consecutive patients with NS-AFL were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity (CV) was measured using 3-dimensional mapping in 3 areas around the TVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These regions were defined as the CTI area from lateral inferior vena cava orifice to coronary sinus ostium (region I), mid- to upper-septum (S), and free wall (F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In region F, the CV was much slower in PA-AFL than in NS-AFL patients (0.43 ± 0.13 vs 0.76 ± 0.26 m/s, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, region I was slower in NS-AFL than PA-AFL (0.57 ± 0.18 m/s vs 0.84 ± 0.24 m/s, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PA-AFL patients, the slow zone was in region F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But in most (11/17) NS-AFL patients the slow zone was in region I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in CV in region S between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unlike NS-AFL, CTI in PA-AFL displays relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conduction but the slow zone is on the free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This arrhythmogenecity of atriotomy may perhaps be avoided if the incisional line were altered to extend to the TV </plain></SENT>
