<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs in 1%-2% of the general population and its prevalence increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi>, a noniodinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36790">benzofuran</z:chebi> similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, was developed as an antiarrhythmic agent for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our systematic review was to critically evaluate randomized controlled trials that compared treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> versus placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Central) were searched up to November 2011 with no language restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We included randomized controlled trials in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> was compared to placebo or other drugs in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal and external validity was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified seven papers corresponding to eight randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DAFNE, EURIDIS/ADONIS, and ATHENA trials demonstrated a reduction of AF recurrence with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> as compared to placebo in patients with nonpermanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DIONYSOS study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> is less effective for the prevention of recurrent AF but improved tolerability as compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering patients with permanent AF, the ERATO trial showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> had rate-control effects while the PALLAS study was stopped early since <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from cardiovascular causes were significantly more frequent in subjects treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> as compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ANDROMEDA trial included patients with recent hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and was terminated early because of excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Like most antiarrhythmic drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> reduces the recurrence of AF in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF as compared to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, relapse rates in the first year of therapy are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> showed to be less effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> should be avoided in patients with permanent AF and a high risk for cardiovascular events or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
