<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 146 consecutive patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> who received emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 55), elective PCI (n = 47), or drug treatment (n = 44) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma NT-proBNP levels and left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) were measured before the treatment intervention and at 1 week and 1 month afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An exercise stress test was performed 1 month after the intervention, and the occurrences of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were recorded at the 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the elective PCI and drug treatment groups, at 1 week and 1 month after the intervention, the emergency PCI group's plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly lower, and the group's LVEFs were significantly higher (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly negative correlation between plasma NT-proBNP levels and LVEFs in each group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive exercise stress testing rates were 13.0%, 32.6%, and 38.6% in the emergency PCI, elective PCI, and drug treatment groups, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrences of MACE in the emergency PCI, elective PCI, and drug treatment groups were 34.5%, 59.5%, and 65.9%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Emergency PCI resulted in lower plasma NT-proBNP levels, lower MACE incidence, higher LVEFs, and better early exercise tolerance compared with elective PCI or drug treatment, indicating that lower plasma NT-proBNP levels predicted a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
