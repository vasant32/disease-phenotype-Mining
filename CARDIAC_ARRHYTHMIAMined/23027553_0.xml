<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present theSpiral Classification Algorithm(SCA), a fast and accurate algorithm for classifying electrical spiral waves and their associated breakup in cardiac tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classification performed by SCA is an essential component of the detection and analysis of various cardiac arrhythmic disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given a digitized frame of a propagating wave, SCA constructs a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, piecewise interpolates this representation with cubic splines, and subjects the result to an accurate curvature analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on spiral-tip tracking, as it considers the entire wave front and back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To increase the smoothness of the resulting symbolic representation, the SCA uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the smoothness at join points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SCA has been applied to a number of representative types of spiral waves, and, for each type, a distinct curvature evolution in time (signature) has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distinct signatures have also been identified for spiral breakup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results represent a significant first step in automatically determining parameter ranges for which a computational cardiac-cell network accurately reproduces a particular kind of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
