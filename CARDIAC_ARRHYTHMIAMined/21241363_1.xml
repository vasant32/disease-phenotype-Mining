<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological (standard intracellular microelectrode technique) and pro-arrhythmic (occurrence of early after-depolarization) effects of five class III agents acting on delayed rectifier current (I(K)), rapid (I(Kr)), and/or slow (I(Ks)) components have been studied in rabbit Purkinje fibers taken near the septum and submitted in vitro to reduced stimulation rate (from 1 to 0.5 Hz) in the absence or presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (10 nm) during normoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were two I(Kr) blockers (d-sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>), two I(Ks) blockers (chromanol 293B and HMR 1556), and a non-selective I(K) blocker (azimilide) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>d-sotalol, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, and azimilide lengthened APD(60) and APD(90) in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both d-sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> showed pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at highest concentrations and in the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and lower stimulation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite azimilide markedly lengthened APD(90), it was globally less pro-arrhythmic than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in normoxic rabbit Purkinje fibers, I(Kr) blockade prolonged action potential duration (APD) and increased the incidence of early after-depolarizations, particularly so in the presence of adrenergic stimulation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, I(Ks) blockade did neither, and non-selective I(K) blockade (by azimilide) behaved principally as I(Kr) blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in normoxic rabbit Purkinje fibers, I(Ks) blockade was neutral, whereas I(Kr) blockade was pro-arrhythmic, which may make a difference worth exploration in more complex models </plain></SENT>
