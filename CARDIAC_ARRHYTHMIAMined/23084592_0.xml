<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">Methadone</z:chebi> and buprenorphine are widely used in the treatment of opioid <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some study results suggest that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> can be associated with QT interval prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, whereas no such risk has been observed for buprenorphine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to determine the risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) increase among patients treated with these medications in an opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) programme, and to study possible associations between QTc changes and serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> or buprenorphine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients enrolled in the OMT programme were followed after start of treatment with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> (n=45) or buprenorphine (n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QTc interval was assessed by electrocardiography (ECG) at baseline and after 1 month (n=79) and 6 months (n=66) in the OMT programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of serum concentrations of buprenorphine, (R)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi>, (S)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients had QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc value above 450 ms) at baseline or after 1 or 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When analysed in a linear mixed effects model, QTc was not associated with the serum concentrations of buprenorphine or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, low serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels increased QTc significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support and extend previous findings that treatment with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> in modest doses (i.e. below 100mg/d) is not associated with clinically significant QTc increases, and that buprenorphine in commonly used doses is a suitable alternative to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> with regard to the risk of QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
