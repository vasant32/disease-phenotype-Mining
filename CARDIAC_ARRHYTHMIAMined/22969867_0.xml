<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the expression of Cx43 and the incidences of ventricular tachyarrhythmias [i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>)] during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild stress (CMS) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) control and CMS rats were assigned into a sham operation (SO) group and a MI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were assessed and Cx43 protein expression was measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 30-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the incidences of VT (7/12, 58.3%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (5/12, 41.7%) in the CMS-MI group were significantly decreased compared with those in the control-MI group (12/12, 100.0% and 11/12, 91.7%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amount of total Cx43 of the CMS-SO group was significantly decreased to approximately 50% compared with that of the control-SO group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 30-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not result in a significant change in the amount of total Cx43 (total Cx43 is defined as the non-phosphorylated Cx43 and phosphorylated Cx43) compared to that of the SO group in CMS rats (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of non-phosphorylated Cx43 in the CMS-MI group was markedly increased compared to that of the CMS-SO group (P&lt;0.05), suggesting that the relative amount of phosphorylated Cx43 was significantly decreased in CMS rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gap junctional permeability in the CMS-MI group (50.4Â±4.9%) was significantly decreased compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-ischemic value in the CMS-SO group (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study suggested that the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias was markedly increased in depressed rats, which may be associated with the reduction of Cx43 protein expression in the ventricle of depressed rats </plain></SENT>
