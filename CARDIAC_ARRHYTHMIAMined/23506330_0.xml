<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, mutations in the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, voltage-gated, type V, alpha subunit gene and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like gene are estimated to account for approximately 28% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 32-year-old mixed-race Brazilian man who is <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, voltage-gated, type V, alpha subunit gene and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like gene mutation-negative with a type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern and a history of high family mortality, including five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> among relatives of whom four were first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient who has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in four first-degree family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case report reinforces the evidence that genetic studies are of limited use while determining risk but remain helpful for diagnosis, and that diagnosis via electrocardiography is of great importance in preventing adverse events and stratifying risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there are several technologically advanced diagnostic tools, they might not be accessible in small towns and hospitals; however, a basic diagnostic tool like electrocardiography is easily accessible </plain></SENT>
