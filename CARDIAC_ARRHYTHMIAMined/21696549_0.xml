<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present a case of a patient referred for left cardiac sympathetic denervation as a last resort treatment option for her 19-year standing diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, based on her atypical clinical course and additional imaging studies, a diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction, rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She left the clinic with a drastically different treatment plan and an improved quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because many cardiac and noncardiac diseases can demonstrate QT prolongation on electrocardiogram, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible diagnoses should be considered before diagnosing a patient with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> especially with regard to the profound treatment implications and genetic follow-up in family members </plain></SENT>
