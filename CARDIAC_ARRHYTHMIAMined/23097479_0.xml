<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Awe-inspiring achievements is what makes sports so fascinating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well appreciated however that top-level sports may sometimes overtax the body, and can lead to injuries, most notably of musculo-skeletal nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper defends the thesis that the heart can also develop sports injuries at the ventricular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We will elaborate on our hypothesis, originally put forward in 2003, that intense endurance activities put a particularly high strain on the right ventricle (RV), which over time, may lead to a proarrhythmic state resembling right (or less often) left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This can develop even in the absence of underlying demonstrable genetic abnormalities, probably just as a result of excessive RV wall stress during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The syndrome of 'exercise-induced arrhythmogenic RV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>' may easily be overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sports cardiologists, like orthopaedic specialists, should be prepared to realise that excessive sports activity can lead to cardiac sports injuries in some, which will help to council on safe participation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
