<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation is being used more frequently as a treatment for these diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although rare, serious complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> have been reported as a result of ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, emergency department (ED) thoracotomy has been reserved for cases of traumatic arrest only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a successful modified ED thoracotomy in a patient with postablation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> and subsequent obstructive shock who failed intravenous fluid resuscitation, pressor administration, and multiple attempts at pericardiocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this case, a modified approach was used to incise the pericardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although this was associated with large blood loss, we believed that using the traditional method of completely removing the pericardium would have resulted in uncontrolled <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, our method led to successful resuscitation of the patient until definitive care was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A smaller pericardial incision than is traditionally used during ED thoracotomy deserves further consideration and research to determine whether and when it may be most useful as a temporizing treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> when other methods have failed </plain></SENT>
