<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An early repolarization (ER) pattern characterized by J-point elevation, slurring of the terminal part of the QRS, and ST-segment elevation has long been recognized and considered to be totally benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have presented evidence demonstrating that an ER pattern in inferior leads or inferolateral leads is associated with increased risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, named early repolarization syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early repolarization syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> share similar electrocardiographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, risk factors, as well as a common arrhythmic platform related to amplification of I(to)-mediated J waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> and early repolarization syndrome differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J wave manifestation, they can be considered to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression, termed J-wave syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early repolarization syndrome has been proposed to be divided into 3 subtypes: type 1, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the lateral precordial leads, is prevalent among healthy male athletes and rarely seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> survivors; type 2, displaying an ER pattern predominantly in the inferior or inferolateral leads, is associated with a higher level of risk; whereas type 3, displaying an ER pattern globally in the inferior, lateral, and right precordial leads, is associated with the highest level of risk for development of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and is often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> storms </plain></SENT>
