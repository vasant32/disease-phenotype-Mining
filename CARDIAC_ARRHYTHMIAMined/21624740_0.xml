<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used to treat patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current-generation LVADs have major limitations, including the need for open chest surgery, limiting their widespread use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the aortoatrial continuity could be used as a unique anatomic vantage point for entirely percutaneous LVAD placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty human autopsied hearts were examined to ascertain the presence and define the dimensions of the continuity between the posterior aortic wall and the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, a "septum" between the aorta and left atrium was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 animal experiments, a custom mechanical shunt was deployed in the wall between the left atrium and noncoronary cusp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With continuous intracardiac ultrasound imaging, and at necropsy, there was no evidence of device dislodgement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo>, or aortic or coronary artery trauma noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use the wall between the aorta and left atrium as an access route for a potentially entirely percutaneous LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a system obviates the need for accessing the left ventricle, minimizing complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the future, such devices may allow widespread treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and severe aortic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valvular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
