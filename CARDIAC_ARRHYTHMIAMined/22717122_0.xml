<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are benign, others can be life threatening and require significant medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As with many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> illnesses, it is important to study the potential psychosocial effects of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and how they may impact a child's quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to create a quality of life measure specific to childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to describe the current psychosocial functioning of this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 46 families participated in a one-time paper and pencil assessment during their regularly scheduled clinic visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results indicated promise for the validity and reliability of this new measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children in the current sample also demonstrated a high degree of resiliency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses with larger samples will be needed to verify the psychometric properties of this measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, the high functioning of many of these children despite medical trauma is promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should consider using some screening measures to decide which children may be most in need of intervention </plain></SENT>
