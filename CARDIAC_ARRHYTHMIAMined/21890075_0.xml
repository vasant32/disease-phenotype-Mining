<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with CSHD and IA who received a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population included 162 patients with CSHD (n = 43) and IA (n = 119) who were prospectively followed up in a nationwide registry from 2005 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mortality rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the study patients was 38 Â± 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with CSHD had a greater frequency of left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;30%) than did the patients with IA (37% vs 5%, respectively; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The predominant indication for WCD was pending genetic testing in the IA group and transplant <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> in the CSHD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compliance with the WCD was similar in the 2 groups (91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WCD shocks successfully terminated 3 ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the patients with IA during a median follow-up of 29 days of therapy (corresponding to 23 appropriate WCD shocks per 100 patient-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in the patients with CSHD during a median follow-up of 27 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients died while actively wearing the WCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 year of follow-up, the survival rates were significantly lower among the patients with CSHD (87%) than among the patients with IA (97%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that the WCD can be safely used in high-risk adult patients with IA and CSHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with IA showed a greater rate of ventricular tachyarrhythmias during therapy but significantly lower long-term mortality rates </plain></SENT>
