<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How delayed afterdepolarizations are synchronized to overcome the source-sink mismatch and produce focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the intact heart remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether local β-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of delayed afterdepolarizations and to examine the effects of tissue geometry and cell-cell coupling on the induction of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Simultaneous optical mapping of transmembrane potential and Ca(2+) transients was performed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit hearts during subepicardial injections (50 μL) of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) or control (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Tyrode's solution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local NE produced premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) from the injection site that were dose-dependent (low-dose [30-60 μmol/L], 0.45±0.62 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> per injection; high-dose [125-250 μmol/L], 1.33±1.46 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> per injection; P&lt;0.0001) and were inhibited by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NE-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> exhibited abnormal voltage-Ca(2+) delay at the initiation site and were inhibited by either sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibition or reduced perfusate [Ca(2+)], which indicates a Ca(2+)-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NE-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> were more common at right ventricular than at left ventricular sites (1.48±1.50 versus 0.55±0.89, P&lt;0.01), and this was unchanged after chemical ablation of endocardial Purkinje fibers, which suggests that source-sink interactions may contribute to the greater propensity to right ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial gap junction uncoupling with carbenoxolone (25 μmol/L) increased focal activity (2.18±1.43 versus 1.33±1.46 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> per injection, P&lt;0.05), which further supports source-sink balance as a critical mediator of Ca(2+)-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first experimental demonstration that localized β-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload and release in the intact heart and highlight the critical nature of source-sink balance in initiating focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
