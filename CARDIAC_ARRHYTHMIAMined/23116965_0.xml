<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the therapeutic potential of ECG on the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the direct actions of ECG on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found ECG enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 μM) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(Na) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(Na) recovery kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Working at a concentration level of I(Na) enhancement, ECG has no notable effect on voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents and L-type Ca(2+) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECG increased the firing rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by ECG in fast firing rate to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sAP waveform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of dominant cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel subunit, Nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal how ECG, the novel I(Na) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
