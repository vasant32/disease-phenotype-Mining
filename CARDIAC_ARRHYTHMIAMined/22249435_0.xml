<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a sensitive marker of altered sympathetic-parasympathetic function and is reduced in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, illness, and trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of major abdominal surgery on the course of HRV parameters is still an issue requiring further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, observational study including 40 consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery under "fast-track" perioperative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time and frequency domain parameters of HRV were measured 1 day prior to operation and on days 1-5 postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>General and surgical complications as well as the course of leucocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP) were documented and correlated to the HRV measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Time domain parameters of HRV showed a significant decrease compared to the preoperative values on postoperative day 1 and returned to baseline on day 2, demonstrating impaired autonomic regulation in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation to complications or course of leukocytes or CRP was significant in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal resections significantly influence the HRV course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The autonomic regulation is reduced in the early postoperative time and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters return to baseline until the third day </plain></SENT>
