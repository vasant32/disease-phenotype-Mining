<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The different influences of one of the PRL isoforms (PRL I) on the cardiovascular system have been described in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Our goal was to establish an appropriate iv dose of 2 PRL isoforms (PRL I and PRL II) in intact rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After establishing this dose, PRL I (0.01 mg/kg) or PRL II (0.001 mg/kg) was administered in bolus 10 min before left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (7 min) followed by re-perfusion (15 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then aimed to study and compare the effects of these isoforms on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>- and re-perfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and re-perfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mortality index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, VT) incidence and duration, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial index of oxygen consumption [pressure rate product (PRP)] were measured and calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both PRL isoforms reduced animal mortality (from 50 to 18.75 and 25%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PRL II significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> incidence (to 25%) as well as VT duration (18.21 Â± 3.09) and these effects were markedly different from PRL I and from the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both PRL reduced PRP in the recovery phase (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We proved that supraphysiological doses of PRL isoforms administered in bolus could protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> as well as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> episodes during re-perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of PRL's positive influence on the cardiovascular system and as an endogenous, well-tolerated substance, it might be of potential clinical use </plain></SENT>
