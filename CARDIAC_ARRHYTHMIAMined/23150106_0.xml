<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Studies analysing the frequency of rhythm disorders in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, factors triggering rhythm disorders occur frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a retrospective case control study was performed investigating the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in a population of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> while evaluating several associated factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The files of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (n  =  293) in the period 2004 - 2008 were analysed retrospectively regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the presence of relevant risk factors was analysed using χ ²tests and logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 61.1  % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were male (mean age 61.7 years) and 38.9  % female (mean age 62.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> according to the Child-Pugh score (CP) was as follows: CP A 43.3  %, CP B 32.8  % and CP C 23.9  % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, rhythm disorders were diagnosed in 16.4  % (48/293) of the study population, most frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (68.8  %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (6.7  %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An advanced age and comorbidities such as arteriosclerotic diseases, hypercholesterinemia (p  &lt;  0.001, each) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (p  =  0.013) correlated significantly with the frequency of rhythm disorders which occurred more often in males than in females (p  = 0.066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085762" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="aca">alcohol abuse</z:e>, the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were not associated significantly with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of rhythm disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>84.4  % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> were treated by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased (&lt;  3.5 mmol/L) and elevated (&gt;  5 mmol/L) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> values were observed in 60.6  % of the study collective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rhythm disorders were more often observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> (especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, p  &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to the average population, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was increased in our cirrhotic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of rhythm disorders was significantly associated with arteriosclerotic diseases, hypercholesterinaemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> must be considered under <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> therapy and in the presence of electrolyte disturbances </plain></SENT>
