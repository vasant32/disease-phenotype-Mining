<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An accurate diagnosis and optimal risk-stratification are often limited because of substantial phenotypic overlap between pathological entities and adaptive cardiovascular responses that normally occur in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An accurate diagnosis, however, is particularly important in this population, as two competing risks need to be cautiously balanced: the risk of under-diagnosis of an arrhythmogenic substrate that may trigger life-threatening events versus the risk of over-diagnosis that may result in an athlete's improper disqualification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in athletes may pose therapeutic dilemmas, and often differs substantially compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this review we present the most frequently observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in athletes and briefly discuss their pathophysiologic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further propose diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based upon current guidelines, official recommendations, and emerging evidence from relevant clinical investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We focus particularly on disparities in current guidelines regarding the management of certain rhythm disorders, as these areas of uncertainty may reflect the challenging nature of these disorders and may indicate the need for individualized approaches in every-day clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electrophysiological responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise, and of the pathophysiological basis and the true clinical significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in athletes, may enhance decision-making, and may allow for management strategies which more prudently weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio of each approach </plain></SENT>
