<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the use of hyperosmolar therapy in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e> (TTH) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and supratentorial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> undergoing renal replacement therapy treated with 23.4% saline (30-60 mL) and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> for high ICP or clinical evidence of TTH were analyzed in a retrospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was reversal of TTH or ICP crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures were modified Rankin scale on hospital discharge, survival to hospital discharge, and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 254 subjects over 7 years, 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> had 11 events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a 23.4% saline bolus, along with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> (91%), hypertonic saline (HS) maintenance fluids (82%), and surgical interventions (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reversal occurred in 6/11 events (55%); 2 of 6 patients survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ICP recording of 6 TTH events showed a reduction from ICP of 41 ± 3.8 mmHg (mean ± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) with TTH to 20.8 ± 3.9 mmHg (p = 0.05) 1 h after the 23.4% saline bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> increased from 141.4 to 151.1 mmol/L 24 h after 23.4% saline bolus (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients were undergoing hemodialysis at the time of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, clinical volume overload, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after HS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with hyperosmolar therapy, primarily 23.4% saline solution, was associated with clinical reversal of TTH and reduction in ICP and had few adverse effects in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hyperosmolar therapy may be safe and effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and these initial findings should be validated in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
