<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The idea presented in this paper is that using many classifiers arranged in the form of ensemble leads to the increased accuracy of the recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such ensemble the important problem is the integration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classifiers into one effective classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper proposes the use of genetic algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was shown that application of the genetic algorithm is very efficient and allows to reduce significantly the total error of heartbeat recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by the numerical experiments performed on the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi> BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database </plain></SENT>
