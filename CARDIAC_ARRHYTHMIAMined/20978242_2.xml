<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is associated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases, a circumstance that makes it a challenge for health care services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to quantify the prevalence of HF in family medicine offices and describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> co-morbidity associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational descriptive study set in a health area of the Community of Madrid, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out in a population of 198,670 individuals over 14 years of age, attended to by 129 specialists in family medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was considered to have HF when this diagnosis (ICPC code K77) appeared in his or her electronic medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of HF was quantified and its association with another 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of HF was 6.9‰, 7.9‰ among women and 5.9‰ among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with HF had a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> co-morbidity, with an average of 5.2 + 2.1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 3% of the patients present with isolated HF and &gt;60% have four or more additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases most frequently detected in HF patients </plain></SENT>
