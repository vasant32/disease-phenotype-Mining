<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 68-year-old female who died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postmortem investigation detected a huge <z:hpo ids='HP_0010617'>cardiac fibroma</z:hpo> in the pars muscularis of the interventricular septum, occupying almost the entire muscular septum, and restricting the volume of left ventricular chamber </plain></SENT>
