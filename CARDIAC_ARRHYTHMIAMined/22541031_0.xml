<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of AF is mainly marked by the associated thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of every six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, one is due to AF, but the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> attributable to AF increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic risk stratification is a key component of the clinical evaluation of the AF patient, and a clinical performance measure, and should guide the antithrombotic therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> is effective for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in nonvalvular AF but, due to several reasons, it is largely underutilized in daily clinical practice, and INR values are often sub-therapeutic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) are easier to manage, and don't require laboratorial monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In phase III clinical trials they have shown to be at least as effective as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, but safer, particularly regarding <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, a complication that is responsible for 90% of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-attributable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show a potential to increase the proportion of AF patients adequately anticoagulated, which will represent a significant advance in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to AF </plain></SENT>
