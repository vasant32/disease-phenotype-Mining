<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 14,290 men and women (75% white; 53% female; mean age, 54 years) free of AF at baseline participating in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study in the United States, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident AF cases through 2009 were ascertained from electrocardiograms, hospital discharge codes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for AF associated with serum and dietary Mg quintiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up time of 20.6 years, 1,755 incident AF cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, lower serum Mg was associated with higher AF risk: compared to individuals in the middle quintile (â‰¥ 0.80-0.83 mmol/L), the HR (95% CI) of AF in quintiles 1, 2, 4, and 5 were 1.34 (1.16-1.54), 0.99 (0.85-1.16), 1.04 (0.90-1.22), and 1.06 (0.91-1.23), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of significant interactions between serum Mg and sex or race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between dietary Mg and AF risk was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum Mg was associated with a higher AF risk, and this association was not different between whites and African Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary Mg was not associated with AF risk </plain></SENT>
