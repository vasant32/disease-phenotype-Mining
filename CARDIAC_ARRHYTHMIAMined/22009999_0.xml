<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a novel case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> administration and review chemotherapy-related cardiac toxicities, focusing on <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-containing compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old man with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149925" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="SCLC">small cell lung cancer</z:e> and asymptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease was inconsistently adherent to his medication regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While undergoing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> infusion, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had no other immediate arrhythmogenic causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His condition remained stable until he died 8 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was unknown and the family declined postmortem examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Although this patient's cardiac history and nonadherence to his medications may have increased his susceptibility to develop atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the Naranjo probability scale reveals a possible relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and infusion of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A literature search revealed other adverse cardiac events due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33749">platinum compounds</z:chebi>; however, to our knowledge, this case is the first to describe an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A definitive causal link cannot be determined, but this may have been the result of a direct arrhythmogenic effect of treatment or to a novel hypersensitivity reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the potential deleterious impact of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, we have reported this case to the Food and Drug Administration as a new adverse effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Providers should consider cardiac monitoring during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="31355">carboplatin</z:chebi> infusion in patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> or at high risk of cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
