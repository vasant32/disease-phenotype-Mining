<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short IEGM snapshots showing 3-10 s before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection were added to the Biotronik Home Monitoring system in 2005 as the first-generation IEGM Online </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RIONI study tested the primary hypothesis that experts' ratings regarding the appropriateness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy based on IEGM Online and on standard 30 s IEGM differ in &lt;10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 619 ICD patients were enrolled and followed for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to a predefined procedure, 210 events recorded by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were selected for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three expert board members rated the appropriateness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and classified the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> using coded IEGM Online and standard IEGM to avoid bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average duration of IEGM Online was 4.4Â±1.5 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to standard IEGM, the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was ventricular in 135 episodes (64.3%), supraventricular in 53 episodes (25.2%), oversensing in 17 episodes (8.1%), and uncertain in 5 episodes (2.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expert board's rating diverged between determinable IEGM Online tracings and standard IEGM in 4.6% of episodes regarding the appropriateness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (95% CI up to 8.0%) and in 6.6% of episodes regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> classification (95% CI up to 10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By enabling accurate evaluation of the appropriateness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the first-generation IEGM Online provided a clinically effective basis for timely interventions and for optimized patient management schemes, which was comparable with current IEGM recordings </plain></SENT>
