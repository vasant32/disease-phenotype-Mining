<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine has been shown to produce atrial-selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-dependent parameters and suppress <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in a variety of experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study contrasts the effects of ranolazine and those of a clinically used anti-AF class IC agent, propafenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological and anti-AF effects of propafenone and ranolazine were compared at clinically relevant concentrations (i.e., 0.3-1.5 and 1-10 μM, respectively) in canine isolated coronary-perfused atrial and ventricular preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmembrane action potential and pseudo-ECG were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both ranolazine and propafenone produced atrial-selective prolongation of action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Propafenone depressed <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-mediated parameters [maximum rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (V(max)), conduction time, and diastolic threshold of excitation] and induced postrepolarization refractoriness to a greater degree than ranolazine, and these effects, unlike those induced by ranolazine, were not or only mildly atrial-selective at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rates (cycle length 500 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At fast pacing rates, however, the effects of propafenone on V(max) and conduction time became atrial-selective, because of the elimination of diastolic interval in atria, but not in ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Propafenone (1.5 μM) and ranolazine (10.0 μM) were effective in preventing the initiation of persistent <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-mediated AF (6/7 and 9/11 atria, respectively), its termination (8/10 and 8/12 atria, respectively), and subsequent reinduction (8/8 and 7/8 atria, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, propafenone and ranolazine both suppress AF, but ranolazine, unlike propafenone, does it with minimal effects on ventricular myocardium, suggesting a reduced potential for promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
