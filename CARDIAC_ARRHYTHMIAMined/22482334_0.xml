<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carbamazepine is an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47802">iminostilbene</z:chebi> derivative structurally related to cyclic antidepressants which implies its potential cardiotxic properties, especially in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the frequency and severity of cardiovascular complications in carbamazepine intoxication and its relationship with level of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with carbamazepine intoxication referred to our department recruited using convenience sampling method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis included following parameters: systolic (SBP) and diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) blood pressure, ECG parameters: heart rate (HR), QRS width, PR interval and corrected QT interval (QTc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relations between features on admission, 12 and 24 hours later and level of consciousness evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 77 patients (28 males, 49 females; median age 25.1) which got our criteria included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QRS complexes in 9 cases (11.7%) were wider than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and PR interval and corrected QT interval (QTc) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between QT interval, QRS width and pulse rate changes with level of consciousness during 24 hours post admission, but blood pressure [systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP)] progressively decreased and PR interval changes progressively increased during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, there was negative correlation just between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sever</z:e> decrease of level of consciousness (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) and blood pressure [systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP)], and positive correlation with QRS complexes widening at 12 hours after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and diastolic blood pressure, QT interval and PR interval on admission and 12 hours and 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regarding the relationship between level of consciousness and cardiovascular changes at 12 hours after admission, particular attention on cardiovascular changes and ECG monitoring particularly in intoxicated patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>), should considered; it will lead to prevent unexpected complication, mortality and to decrease the length of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
