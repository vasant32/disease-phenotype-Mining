<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the beneficial aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the myocardial metabolism have been widely demonstrated the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the myocardial oxygen tension (PmyO2) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this reason the PmyO2 of German Landrace pigs (male, three months of age) during ECC was analysed under mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (32°C, n = 6 pigs) and under normothermia (n = 10 pigs, control group) within a time period of 23 min (1400 sec) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flexible invasive Clark type microcatheters were used to measure the PmyO2 in the beating heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During normothermal ECC a continuous PmyO2 increase from 36.5 ± 15.8 mmHg to 52.6 ± 27.2 mmHg (+44.1%) after 1400 sec was measured (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> caused a continuous PmyO2 decrease from initially 46.9 ± 17.5 mmHg to 36.7 ± 20.8 mmHg (-21.8%, p &lt; 0.013) in the test period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography revealed no signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during normo- and hypothermic ECC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems obvious that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> results in a reduction of the oxygen transfer to the myocardial cells and that this effect outweighs the beneficial effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> in the myocardium which are related to <z:mp ids='MP_0005290'>reduced oxygen consumption</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> oxygen supply to the myocardium remained sufficient for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardial function </plain></SENT>
