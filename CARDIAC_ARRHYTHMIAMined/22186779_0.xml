<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy is an established therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, improving quality of life and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite advances in technique, available leads and delivery systems, trans-venous left ventricular (LV) lead positioning remains dependent on the patient's underlying venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left phrenic nerve courses over the surface of the pericardium laterally and may be stimulated by the LV pacing lead, causing uncomfortable diaphragmatic twitch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) procedure to correct phrenic nerve stimulation secondary to cardiac resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Most current ways of avoiding phrenic stimulation involve either electronic reprogramming to distance the phrenic nerve from the stimulation circuit or repositioning the lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe a case where the phrenic nerve was surgically insulated from the stimulating current by insinuating a patch of bovine pericardium between the epicardium and native pericardium of the heart thus completely resolving previously intolerable and incessant diaphragmatic twitch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia with single-lung ventilation and minimal use of neuromuscular blocking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical patch insulation of the phrenic nerve was performed using minimally invasive VATS surgery, as a short-stay procedure, with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No diaphragmatic twitch occurred post-surgery and the patient continued to gain symptomatic benefit from cardiac synchronization therapy (New York Heart Association Class III to II), enabling return to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In cases where the trans-venous position of a LV lead is limited by troublesome phrenic nerve stimulation, thoracoscopic surgical patch insulation of the phrenic nerve could be considered to allow beneficial cardiac resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
