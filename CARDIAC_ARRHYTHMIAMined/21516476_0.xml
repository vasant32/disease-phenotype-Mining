<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the correlation of CCI with the Clavien postoperative complication scale (CPCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perioperative characteristics of 47 patients undergoing radical nephrectomy were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following items were assessed: preoperative patient characteristics including age, gender, CCI, American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) physical status classification system category, renal and hepatic functions, type of nephrectomy incision, operative time, clinical stage and histopathological subtype of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and preoperative co-morbid conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo>, renal and hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, postoperative complications were also graded according to the CPCS and accepted as those occurring within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary diseases</z:e> were found to be significant risk factors for the development of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age adjusted odds ratio was 7.112 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean CCI in patients who did not develop any postoperative complication was 4.49 ± 1.95, whereas it was 5.75 ± 2.60 for patients who developed postoperative complications (P = 0.138) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Spearman correlation analysis, CCI value was found to be significantly correlated with CPCS grade (P = 0.011, rho value = 0.366) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> is a strong predictor of postoperative complications after radical nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher preoperative CCI scores may have higher postoperative CPCS grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are warranted </plain></SENT>
