<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study has determined whether neighbourhood deprivation is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether there is an association between neighbourhood deprivation and hospitalization for AF.METHODS AND RESULTS: The entire Swedish population aged 25-74 years was followed from 1 January 2000 until hospitalization for AF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, emigration, or the end of the study period (31 December 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analysed by multilevel logistic regression, with individual-level characteristics (age, marital status, family income, educational attainment, migration status, urban/rural status, mobility, and comorbidity) at the first level and level of neighbourhood deprivation at the second level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neighbourhood deprivation was significantly associated with AF hospitalization rate in women [odds ratio (OR) = 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.47], but not men (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds of AF in women living in the most deprived neighbourhoods remained significant after adjustment for age and individual-level socioeconomic characteristics (OR = 1.12, 95% 1.08-1.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the full model, which took account of age, individual-level socioeconomic characteristics, and comorbidities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e>, OR = 1.30; type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, OR = 1.32; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> and alcohol-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, OR = 1.57; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, OR = 2.84; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, OR = 1.80; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, OR = 7.40; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, OR = 1.81; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, OR = 6.79), the odds of AF did not remain significant in women in the most deprived neighbourhoods (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.07).CONCLUSION: Neighbourhood deprivation and socioeconomic disparities are not independently associated with hospitalized AF in contrast to many other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
