<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are voltage oscillations that occur during the repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential and cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a variety of clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EADs occur in the setting of reduced repolarization reserve and increased inward-over-outward currents, which intuitively explains the repolarization delay but does not mechanistically explain the time-dependent voltage oscillations that are characteristic of EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a recent theoretical study, we identified a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation as a dynamical mechanism that causes voltage oscillations during EADs, depending on the amplitude and kinetics of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC) current relative to the repolarizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate this mechanism experimentally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that cardiac monolayers exposed to the LTCC <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> BayK8644 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> produce EAD bursts that are suppressed by the LTCC blocker nitrendipine but not by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current blocker tetrodoxin, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of intracellular Ca(2+) stores with thapsigargin and <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, or buffering of intracellular Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These EAD bursts exhibited a key dynamical signature of the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism, namely, a gradual slowing in the frequency of oscillations before burst termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A detailed cardiac action potential model reproduced the experimental observations, and identified intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> accumulation as the likely mechanism for terminating EAD bursts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings in cardiac monolayers provide direct support for the Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism of EAD-mediated triggered activity, and raise the possibility that this mechanism may also contribute to EAD formation in clinical settings such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and increased sympathetic output </plain></SENT>
