<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF is a persistent condition with progressive structural remodeling of the atrial cardiomyocytes due to the AF itself, resulting in cellular changes commonly observed in aging and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While rhythm control by electrocardioversion or drug treatment is the treatment of choice in symptomatic AF patients, its efficacy is still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current research is directed at preventing first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF by limiting the development of substrates underlying AF progression and resembles mechanism-based therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upstream therapy refers to the use of non-ion channel anti-arrhythmic drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF, with the ultimate aim to prevent the occurrence (primary prevention) or recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> following (spontaneous) conversion (secondary prevention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) are molecular chaperones and comprise a large family of proteins involved in the protection against various forms of cellular stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their classical function is the conservation of proteostasis via prevention of toxic protein aggregation by binding to (partially) unfolded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our recent data reveal that <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> prevent electrical, contractile, and structural remodeling of cardiomyocytes, thus attenuating the AF substrate in cellular, Drosophila melanogaster, and animal experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, studies in humans suggest a protective role for <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> against the progression from paroxysmal AF to persistent AF and in recurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss upregulation of the heat shock response system as a novel target for upstream therapy to prevent derailment of proteostasis and consequently progression and recurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
