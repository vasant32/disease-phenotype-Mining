<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have demonstrated an increased prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature contractions</z:e> and anatomical changes in AN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate P wave parameters and P wave dispersion, an electrocardiographic marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and its effect on AN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group included 48 patients with AN, most hospitalized for a few weeks, and a matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underwent 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) under strict standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P wave length and P wave dispersion in each patient were computed from a randomly selected beat and an averaged beat, constructed from 7 to 12 beats, included in a 10-s ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences found between the groups for minimal, maximal, average P wave duration and P wave dispersion, calculated either from a random beat or averaged beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, medically treated AN patients who have gained weight have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> P wave parameters, and therefore do not appear to have an increased electrocardiographic risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate the influence of different disease stages, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> and other medical complications on P wave parameters and risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in AN patients </plain></SENT>
