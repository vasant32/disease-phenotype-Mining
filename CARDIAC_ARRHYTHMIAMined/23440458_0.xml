<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36281">caffeic acid</z:chebi> phenethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (CAPE) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, two natural anti-inflammatory <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi>, on I ( hERG ) in HEK-293 cells overexpressed with hERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CAPE dose-dependently decreased repolarization tail current of hERG (I ( hERG,tail); IC(50), 10.6 ± 0.5 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CAPE also shifted half-activation voltage (V (1/2)) to the left (from -17.5 to -26.5 mV) and accelerated activation and inactivation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CAPE inhibition of I ( hERG,tail) was not attenuated in the pore-blocker site mutants of hERG (Y652A and F656A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A point mutation of Cys723 (C723S) mimicked the effects of CAPE and caused a left shift of V (1/2) and acceleration of I ( hERG,tail) deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, I ( hERG,tail) inhibition by CAPE was still observed in C723S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, CAPE inhibits hERG channel by class 3 mechanism, i.e., modification of gating, not by blocking the pore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> induced changes of I ( hERG ) similar to those of CAPE, while additional interaction with pore-blocking sites was suggested from attenuated I ( hERG,tail) inhibition in Y652A and F656A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, I ( hERG ) induced by human action potential voltage clamp was increased by CAPE while decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mathematical simulation of action potential derived from the experimental results of CAPE and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> supports that CAPE, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi>, would induce shortening of AP duration by facilitation of I ( hERG ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The above results revealed intriguing roles of Cys723 in hERG kinetics and suggested that conventional drug screening by using step pulse protocol for I ( hERG,tail) would overlook the hERG kinetic modulations that could compensate the decrease of I ( hERG,tail) </plain></SENT>
