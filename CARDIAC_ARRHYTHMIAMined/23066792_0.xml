<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, we have begun to elucidate the genetic substrate underlying AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of multiple risk loci that confer increased susceptibility to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These loci harbor intriguing candidate genes including those encoding ion channels, transcription factors, and signaling molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current efforts are ongoing to functionally validate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the future, novel genotyping technologies such as exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing promise to uncover a greater proportion of the heritability underlying AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article we review recent advances in AF genetics research and discuss future developments in the field </plain></SENT>
