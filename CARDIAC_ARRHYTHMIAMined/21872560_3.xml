<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the device- and procedure-related safety of a novel force-sensing radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter capable of measuring the real-time contact force (CF) and to present CF data and its possible implications on patient safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical outcome of RF ablation for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> may be affected by the CF between the catheter tip and the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insufficient CF may result in an ineffective lesion, whereas excessive CF may result in complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-seven patients (43 with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>] and 34 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> [AF]) received percutaneous ablation with the novel studied catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CF applied and safety events related to the procedure were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CF values at mapping ranged from 8 ± 8 to 60 ± 35 g and from 12 ± 10 to 39 ± 29 g in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> group and the LA group, respectively, showing a significant interinvestigator variability (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High transient CFs (&gt;100 g) were noted in 27 patients (79%) of the LA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One device-related complication (tamponade, 3%) occurred in the AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation using real-time CF technology is safe for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High CFs may occur during catheter manipulation and not just during ablation, suggesting that measuring CF may provide additional useful information to the operator for safe catheter manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the future, CF-sensing catheters may also increase the effectiveness of RF ablations by allowing better control of the RF lesion size </plain></SENT>
