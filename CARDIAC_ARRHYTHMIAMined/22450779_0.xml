<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Despite favorable metabolic and vascular effects, thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs have not convincingly reduced cardiovascular mortality in clinical trials, raising the possibility of countervailing, off-target effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that TZDs block cardiac ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channels in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether TZDs affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, spectral characteristics, and mortality of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) and whether such effects are recapitulated by a non-selective K(ATP) blocker (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>) or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> K(ATP) blocker (5-hydroxydecanoate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 121 anesthetized pigs were pre-treated with TZD (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi>, 1 mg/kg IV, resulting in clinically relevant plasma concentrations), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg IV), 5-hydroxydecanoate (5 mg/kg IV) or inert vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subset of pigs treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> or vehicle, ischemic preconditioning was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 6 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In non-preconditioned pigs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> occurred sooner with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (11±3 min, p&lt;0.05) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (14±3 min, p=0.06) than with vehicle (20±2 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Defibrillation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was successful in 44% of pigs treated with vehicle, compared with 0% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (p=0.057) and 33% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After ischemic preconditioning, defibrillation was successful in 62% of pigs treated with vehicle, compared with 26% treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TZDs attenuated slowing of conduction due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and shifted ECG power spectra during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> toward higher frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> effects of TZDs were recapitulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, but not by 5-hydroxydecanoate, supporting an interaction of TZDs with the sarcolemmal K(ATP) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a porcine model, TZDs promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and increase mortality of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, associated with alterations of conduction and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> spectral characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar effects in a clinical setting might adversely impact cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
