<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The centenarian population is gradually increasing, so it is becoming more common to see centenarians in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram abnormalities in the elderly have been reported, but several methodological biases have been detected that limit the validity of their results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to analyse the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> in a prospective study of the centenarian population and to assess their impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We performed a domiciliary visit, where a medical history, an ECG and blood analysis were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Barthel index (BI), cognitive mini-exam (CME) and Charlson index (ChI) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up by telephone up until their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 80 centenarians were studied, 26 men and 64 women, mean age 100.8 (SD 1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 81% had been admitted to the hospital at least once in the past, 81.3% were taking drugs (mean 3.3, rank 0-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ChI was 1.21 (SD 1.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men had higher scores both for BI (70 -SD 34.4- vs. 50.4 -SD 36.6-, P = .005) and CME (16.5 -SD 9.1- vs. 9.1 -SD 11.6-, P = .008); 40.3% of the centenarians had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, 67.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, 13% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>, 22.1% <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminaemia</z:hpo> and 10.7% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e>, without statistically significant differences regarding sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 7% had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG; 21 (26.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), 30 (37.5%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e> and 31 (38.8%) abnormalities suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, without sex-related differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was significantly associated with the presence of AF (P = .002, OR 5.2, CI 95% 1.8 to 15.2) and changes suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P = .019, OR 3.2, CI 95% 1.2-8.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean survival was 628 days (SD 578.5), median 481 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mortality risk was independently associated with the presence of AF (RR 2.0, P = .011), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> (RR 2.2, P = .032), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminaemia</z:hpo> (RR 3.5, P &lt; .001) and functional dependence assessed by BI (RR 1.8, P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> are common in centenarians, they are not related to sex, functional capacity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The only abnormality that has an impact on survival is AF </plain></SENT>
