<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Direct catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> does not yield reproducible permanent control as for other atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need for an alternative intervention, i.e., left atrial exclusion, based on elective ablation of the interatrial connecting bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the "operative <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>" of the three major interatrial connections: the Bachmann bundle, the coronary sinus bundle, and the left atrial-atrioventricular node connection, based on macroscopic dissections of human and porcine hearts and our previous experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified the three right atrial attachments, with the coronary sinus (CS) and left atrial (LA)-atrioventricular (AV) nodal connection being most problematic for safe ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To obtain a complete isolation of the left from the right atrium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three connections must be ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CS connection must be ablated distal to the ostium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If present, the LA-AV nodal connection can be safely ablated from the left atrium </plain></SENT>
