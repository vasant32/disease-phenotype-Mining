<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was that the intervention would reduce the occurrence of phantom shocks.METHODS AND RESULTS: The design was secondary explorative analyses of data from a randomized controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-six patients with first-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (79% male, mean age 58 years) were randomized (1 : 1) to either combined rehabilitation or a control group receiving 'treatment as usual' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 144 participants completed the 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention consisted of 12 weeks of exercise training and 1 year of psycho-educational follow-up focusing on modifiable factors associated with poor outcomes, e.g. phantom shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were ancillary questions regarding the experience of phantom shocks, date, time, and place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (9.4%) experienced a phantom shock, 7 in the intervention group and 5 in the control group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither age, sex, quality of life nor perceived health at baseline was significantly related to the probability of occurrence of phantom shock.CONCLUSION: Phantom shocks were experienced by about one in ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients, with no interventional effect found and no significant difference found regarding receiving an actual shock therapy among phantom shock patients.: Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT00569478) </plain></SENT>
