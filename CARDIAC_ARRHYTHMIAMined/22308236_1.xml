<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated mechanisms by which the Kir2.1 D172N mutation facilitates and perpetuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The ten Tusscher et al. model for human ventricular action potentials (APs) was modified to incorporate changes to I(K1) based on experimentally observed changes to Kir2.1 function: both heterozygous (WT-D172N) and homozygous (D172N) mutant scenarios were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell models were incorporated into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> one-dimensional (1D), 2D tissue, and 3D models to compute the restitution curves of AP duration (APD-R), effective refractory period (ERP-R), and conduction velocity (CV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporal and spatial vulnerability of ventricular tissue to re-entry was measured and dynamic behaviour of re-entrant excitation waves (lifespan and dominant frequency) in 2D and 3D models of the human ventricle was characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D172N 'mutant' I(K1) led to abbreviated APD and ERP, as well as steeper APD-R and ERP-R curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It reduced tissue excitability at low excitation rates but increased it at high rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It increased tissue temporal vulnerability for initiating re-entry, but reduced the minimal substrate size necessary to sustain re-entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SQT3 'mutant' I(K1) also stabilized and accelerated re-entrant excitation waves, leading to sustained rapid re-entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased I(K1) due to the Kir2.1 D172N mutation increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk due to increased tissue vulnerability, shortened ERP, and altered excitability, which in combination facilitate initiation and maintenance of re-entrant circuits </plain></SENT>
