<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from mice and humans suggest multiple roles for Tbx3 in development and function of the cardiac conduction system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the functional development, maturation, and maintenance of the conduction system are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the requirements for Tbx3 in these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We generated a unique series of Tbx3 hypomorphic and conditional mouse mutants with varying levels and locations of Tbx3 activity within the heart, and developed techniques for evaluating in vivo embryonic conduction system function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disruption of Tbx3 function in different regions of the developing heart causes discrete phenotypes and lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>: sinus pauses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> indicate sinoatrial node dysfunction, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> reveal abnormalities in the atrioventricular junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surviving Tbx3 mutants are at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by knockdown of Tbx3 in adults reveal its requirement for conduction system homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> in Tbx3-deficient embryos are accompanied by disrupted expression of multiple ion channels despite preserved expression of previously described conduction system markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that Tbx3 is required for the conduction system to establish and maintain its correct molecular identity and functional properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Tbx3 is required for the functional development, maturation, and homeostasis of the conduction system in a highly dosage-sensitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TBX3 and its regulatory targets merit investigation as candidates for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
