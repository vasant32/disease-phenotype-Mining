<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The transseptal puncture technique has been widely used in therapeutic left atrium catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But this technique may lead to some life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can not be used widely because it is restricted by economy and deferring the transseptal puncture procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to introduce a simple and safe transseptal puncture procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The distal of coronary sinus (CS) electrode was positioned close to the lateral margin of heart, which was about at 3 o'clock at left anterior oblique (LAO) 30° referred to whole cardiac profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was then used as the marker for the level of fossa ovalis at posterior-anterior projection to guide the pull of transseptal needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The midpoint between the distal CS and the posterior margin of heart at right anterior oblique (RAO) 45° view was considered as the location of fossa ovalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Once the puncture was succeeded, the guidewire was introduced to the left superior pulmonary vein via puncture sheath after the needle was retrieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The end of outer sheath was introduced into left atrium with the protection of guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was applied in 539 patients (316 male, 223 female; (53 ± 16) years old) who underwent catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or left-sided atrioventricular accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This transseptal approach reached 100.0% success and was succeeded in 98.9% with the first attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first attempt puncture was aborted due to greater resistance to needle advancement or smaller needle curve in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the second attempts were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> succeeded after the needle curve was reshaped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no tamponade and embolism occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The atrial septum puncture approach using the location of distal CS electrode as important marker and the guidewire for protection when sending outer sheath into left atrium is reliable and safe </plain></SENT>
