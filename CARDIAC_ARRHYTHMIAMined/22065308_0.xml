<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Nonsense mutations that create premature termination codons (PTC) leading to disease by a mechanism of haploinsufficiency are relatively common in the SCN5A gene encoding the major <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel in heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTCs in SCN5A are associated with isolated conduction disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological therapy does not exist for these disorders, but would be highly beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, an orally bio-available drug capable of suppressing premature termination, PTC124, has been identified that selectively induces ribosomal read-through of premature but not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> termination codons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term effects of PTC124 on action potential characteristics of rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The effects of PTC124 on action potentials of isolated adult rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes were studied using the perforated patch-clamp methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> effects of PTC124 were measured in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, while long term effects were measured after 48 h in cultured cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Resting membrane potential, maximum upstroke velocity, action potential amplitude and action potential duration at 20, 50 and 90% of repolarization were not affected by application of PTC124, neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nor after 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PTC124 has no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or long-term effects on rabbit ventricular action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These experiments form the basis for future studies evaluating the use of this therapy in preventing potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with BrS and/or conduction disease </plain></SENT>
