<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A recently developed dye-based assay to study gap junction permeability is analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The assay is based on electroporation of dye into a large number of connexin 43 expressing cells, grown to confluency on electrically conductive slides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subsequent intercellular spread of dye to non-electroporated parts of the monolayer enables estimation of the intercellular coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, the extent of dye spread has been analyzed in qualitative terms only and not in a manner based directly on the physics of the underlying diffusion process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We apply a continuum approximation assuming that the observed dye spread can be described by Fick's law of diffusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deduced from Fick's law, new measures are presented which directly relate the observed spread of dye to the diffusion coefficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The theoretical framework enables the estimation of an effective diffusion coefficient from Fick's law independently of the specific indicator substance used in the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For Lucifer Yellow, diffusion stops within few minutes after the electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore only an order-of-magnitude estimate of the diffusion coefficient can be given for this dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In terms of the underlying diffusion coefficient, the hitherto used measures give a relatively poor degree of quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the present methods may yield direct information on the effective intercellular diffusion coefficient and hence provide additional and more precise information as to the permeability modulating effect of various substances </plain></SENT>
