<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated stimulation of the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi), the nucleus which is thought to play a role in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep control, activates an inhibitory pathway to preganglionic cardiac vagal neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (NA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we test the hypothesis that hypocretin-1 modulates the inhibitory neurotransmission to cardiac vagal neurons evoked by stimulation of the LPGi using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation from rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of hypocretin-1 receptors produced a dose-dependent and long-term facilitation of GABAergic postsynaptic currents evoked by electrical stimulation of the LPGi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> diminished LPGi-evoked GABAergic current in cardiac vagal neurons and this inhibition by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was prevented by pre-application of hypocretin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The action of hypocretin-1 was blocked by the hypocretin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SB-334867 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Facilitation of LPGi-evoked GABAergic current in cardiac vagal neurons under both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition and during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> could be the mechanism by which hypocretin-1 affects parasympathetic cardiac function and heart rate during REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings indicate a new potential mechanism that might be involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> that can occur during sleep </plain></SENT>
