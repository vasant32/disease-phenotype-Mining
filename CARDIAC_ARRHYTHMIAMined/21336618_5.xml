<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether implementation of a three-point strategy would reduce major vascular complications resulting from catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred twenty-four consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF were studied: 162 in each group (with and without the test strategy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three-point test strategy included the following: (1) performing the procedure on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> with an INR from 2.0 to 3.5 (mean INR of 2.44), rather than stopping <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> prior to the procedure and bridging the patient back to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> with low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, (2) using a small 21 G needle to obtain femoral vein access rather than a larger 18 G needle, and (3) eliminating the use of femoral arterial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major vascular complications were defined as complications requiring either blood transfusion or surgical/percutaneous repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major vascular complications were identified in 6/162 (3.7%) of the control patients without the strategy listed above compared to 0/162 (0%) in the test patients with implementations of this strategy (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of other complications was comparable between the two groups (tamponade requiring drainage: 1/162 control, 1/162 test; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> not requiring drainage: 0/162 control, 1/162 test; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>: 1/162 control and 1/162 test; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 1/162 control, 0/162 test): (p = NS for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A three-point strategy including performing procedures with therapeutic <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>, using a small gauge needle to obtain vascular access and eliminating femoral arterial access significantly reduced major vascular access complications and did not affect other major complications, during catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implementation of this strategy may be useful to reduce groin complications resulting from AF ablation </plain></SENT>
