<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>Mitral stenosis</z:hpo> (MS) is a structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001633'>abnormality of the mitral valve</z:hpo> apparatus that can be resulted from previous rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011570'>congenital mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100570'>carcinoid</z:hpo> disease etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> can affect the incidence, duration and frequency of AF post mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected fifty patients with rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and 50 patients with non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> who were candidates for mitral valve replacement (MVR) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-operative tests such as CRP, ESR, CBC, UA, ANA, APL (IgM, IgG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, RF were performed on participants' samples and the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo>, rheumatic or non-rheumatic, was determined clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early post-operative complications such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, renal and respiratory dysfunction etc., were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent holter monitoring after being out of ICU to the time of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 48.56 Â± 17.64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>57 cases (57%) were male, and 43 cases (43%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post-operative AF occurred in 14 cases (14%); 3 cases (6%) in non-rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> group, and 11 cases (22%) in the rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between the incidence of AF and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>Renal dysfunction</z:hpo> after MVR was higher in rheumatic MS group than in non-rheumatic MS group (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> (rheumatic or non-rheumatic) and early mortality after mitral valve replacement (P = 0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We concluded that the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> affect post-operative outcomes, especially the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and some complications after mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
