<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defibrillation using electric shocks is the only choice of treatment to restore the heart to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rhythm especially in out-of-the-hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> incidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Refibrillation (i.e., recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) is a common and significant problem in cardiac resuscitation as it negatively impacts the survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such refibrillation cases administration of anti-arrhythmic drugs could improve the shock outcomes or prevent refibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases of prolonged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior to the shocks have been shown to improve the survival rates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This feedback in real-time would be of immense assistance to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel in choosing the right combination of therapies (i.e., shock, CPR, pharmacology interventions) in improving the shock outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a real-word database of 34 pre-shock <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> electrograms obtained from Toronto area EMS personnel, the proposed method achieved classification accuracies of 76.5% and 75% for a two level binary classification of the three groups </plain></SENT>
