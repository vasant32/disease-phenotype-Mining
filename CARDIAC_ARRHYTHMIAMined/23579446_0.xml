<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Effective <z:chebi fb="29" ids="37577">chemical compound</z:chebi> toxicity screening is of paramount importance for safe cardiac drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using mammals in preliminary screening for detection of cardiac dysfunction by electrocardiography (ECG) is costly and requires a large number of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, zebrafish embryos can be used as the ECG waveform is similar to mammals, a minimal amount of chemical is necessary for drug testing, while embryos are abundant, inexpensive and represent replacement in animal research with reduced bioethical concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here the utility of pre-feeding stage zebrafish larvae in detection of cardiac dysfunction by electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have optimised an ECG recording system by addressing key parameters such as the form of immobilization, recording temperature, electrode positioning and developmental age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, analysis of 3 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos treated with known QT prolonging drugs such as terfenadine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> led to reproducible detection of QT prolongation as previously shown for adult zebrafish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, calculation of Z-factor scores revealed that the assay was sensitive and specific enough to detect large drug-induced changes in QTc intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the ECG recording system is a useful drug-screening tool to detect alteration to cardiac cycle components and secondary effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in zebrafish larvae before free feeding stage, and thus provides a suitable replacement for mammalian experimentation </plain></SENT>
