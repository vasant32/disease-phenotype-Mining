<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48669">Tranexamic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi>) has been shown to reduce blood loss in surgical patients and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, with no apparent increase in vascular occlusive events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings raise the possibility that it might also be effective in traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>Intracranial Bleeding</z:mp> Study (CRASH-2 IBS) was conducted to quantify the effect of an early short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> on intracranial haemorrhage and new focal cerebral ischaemic lesions in patients with TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: CRASH-2 IBS was a prospective randomised controlled trial nested within the CRASH-2 trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a local pack system that selected the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from the pack number, the treatment packs were identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pack number was recorded on the entry form, which was sent to the international trial co-ordinating centre in London, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once the treatment pack number was recorded, the patient was included in the trial whether or not the treatment pack was opened or the allocated treatment started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> site investigators and trial co-ordinating centre staff were masked to treatment allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Ten hospitals: (India) Aditya Neuroscience Centre, Sanjivani Hospital, CARE Hospital, Christian Medical College, Medical Trust Hospital, Jeevan Jyoti Hospital and (Colombia) Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paul, Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, Hospital Universitario San José de Popayán and Fundación Valle del Lili </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The trial was conducted in a subset of 270 CRASH-2 trial participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients eligible for inclusion in the CRASH-2 IBS fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the CRASH-2 trial, and also had TBI [Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score of ≤ 14 and a brain computerised tomography (CT) scan compatible with TBI] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pregnant women and patients for whom a second brain CT scan was not possible were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to receive either a loading dose of 1 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> infused over 10 minutes followed by an intravenous infusion of 1 g over 8 hours or matching placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the increase in size of intracranial haemorrhage growth between a CT scan at hospital admission and a second scan 24-48 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients were allocated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> and 137 to placebo, of whom information on the primary (imaging) outcome was available for 123 (92%) and 126 (92%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The analysis suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> was likely to be associated with a reduction in haemorrhage growth [adjusted difference -3.8 ml, 95% credibility interval (CrI) -11.5 ml to 3.9 ml], fewer focal ischaemic lesions [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% CrI 0.20 to 1.46] and fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.22 to 1.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This was the first randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> in TBI patients and it found that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful effects can be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, although uncertainty remains, our analyses suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36088">TXA</z:chebi> administration might improve outcome in TBI patients and provide grounds for evaluating this hypothesis in future research </plain></SENT>
