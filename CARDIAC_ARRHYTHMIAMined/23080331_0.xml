<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiac autonomic functions between Turkish and Japanese MetS patients with heart rate turbulence (HRT) and heart rate variability (HRV) were compared as the aim of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study consists of 149 nondiabetic subjects with MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were further classified into subgroups based on ethnicity (76 from Turkey, 73 from Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory Holter ECG recording was applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects whose HRV and HRT (total <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO), total slope (TS)) parameters were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The waist circumference was the only demographic parameter that was significantly different between the Turkish and Japanese patients with MetS (99.31 ± 6.12 vs 91.12 ± 6.89 for men and 91.48 ± 7.45 vs 86.26 ± 5.78 for woman; p &lt; 0.001 and &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between Turkish and Japanese patients with MetS in terms of the HRT values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(TO Turkish, 0.77 ± 0.19 %; TO Japanese, 0.49 ± 1.03 %, p = 0.031; TS Turkish, 1.93 ± 1.26; TS Japanese, 2.44 ± 1.37, p = 0.041, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for HRV parameters, standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NN intervals index was only different between Turkish and Japanese patients with MetS (90.79 ± 58.94, 128.18 ± 105.30; p = 0.034, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HRT and some HRV scores of ethnic Turkish MetS patients are worse than the scores of ethnic Japan MetS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We think that these differences are related to the central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
