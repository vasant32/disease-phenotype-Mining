<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The G-rich sequences and the G-quadruplexes were localized adjacent to the binding motif of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, which negatively regulates relaxin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that the formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> could influence relaxin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>-induced formation of G-quadruplexes did increase relaxin gene expression measured at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Formation of G-quadruplexes significantly reduced STAT3 binding to the promoter of relaxin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was associated with consequent increase in the binding of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II and STAT5a to relaxin gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cardiac fibroblasts and rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> was found to suppress fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> through up-regulating relaxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The antifibrotic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> in vitro and in vivo was similar to that by exogenous relaxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin </plain></SENT>
