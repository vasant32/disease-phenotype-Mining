<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Determinant risk factors for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein losing enteropathy</z:hpo> (PLE), including haemodynamics, remain unclear in patients after the Fontan operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our purpose was to characterize the serial PLE haemodynamics before and after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and to determine the risk factors based on the cardiac catheterization-based analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 354 Fontan survivors who had undergone postoperative cardiac catheterizations, we experienced 26 PLE patients during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-left ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> systemic ventricle, functional one-lung pulmonary circulation and an early postoperative high central venous pressure (CVP) were associated with the PLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the high CVP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19 per 1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.37, especially â‰¥12 mmHg, OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.25-7.64, P &lt; 0.05 for both) and one-lung pulmonary circulation (OR = 10.0-10.5, P &lt; 0.001) independently predicted the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of the PLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a Fontan route stenosis/obstruction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, ventricular dysfunction/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and pulmonary arterio-venous fistulae were demonstrated in 10 (38%), 8 (31%), 4 (15%) and 3 (12%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared with 56 excellent Fontan survivors, the high CVP, ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery resistance, and the low arterial oxygen saturation, systemic artery pressure, and ventricular ejection fraction characterized the pre-PLE Fontan haemodynamics (P &lt; 0.05-0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the following intensive treatments reduced the CVP, systemic artery pressure and cardiac output (P &lt; 0.05-0.01), resulting in haemodynamics no different from those of the excellent survivors, except for the low systemic pressure (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pre-PLE haemodynamics was characterized by several impaired haemodynamics, while those after PLE only by a low systemic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A high early postoperative CVP was the only haemodynamic predictor for a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strict selective criteria for the operation and strategies to eliminate CVP-raising factors are mandatory to prevent a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PLE </plain></SENT>
