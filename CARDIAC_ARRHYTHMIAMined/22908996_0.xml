<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats fed a standard rat chow plus red palm oil (200 µL/day) for 5 weeks were compared with untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic but not particulate PKCε expression as well as Cx43-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, total Cx43 proteins, and its phoshorylated forms were increased, and disordered localization of Cx43 was attenuated in the left ventricle of RPO-fed SHR compared with untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These alterations were associated with suppression of early post-ischemic-reperfusion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and electrically inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the treatment dose of RPO caused down-regulation of myocardial Cx43, but did not alter its cell membrane distribution or overall PKCε expression in WKY rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was, however, associated with poor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> protection, suggesting overdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that SHR benefit from RPO intake, particularly because of its apparent anti-arrhythmic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This protection can be, in part, attributed to the preservation of cell-to-cell communication via up-regulation of myocardial Cx43, but not with PKCε activation </plain></SENT>
