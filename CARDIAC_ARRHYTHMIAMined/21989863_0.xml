<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of tissue Doppler echocardiography-derived E/E' for risk stratification before noncardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 445 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> who had undergone tissue Doppler echocardiography before noncardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) was assessed from clinical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After excluding patients who could not have E/E' measurements, 200 patients were further analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCEs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and deferred surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients developed PCEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>E/E' was significantly higher in patients with PCE (18.4 ± 5.8 vs. 12.2 ± 4.5, p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed E/E' (odds ratio 1.2, p &lt; 0.007) and RCRI (OR 4.8; 95%, p &lt; 0.006) were independent predictors of PCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>E/E' appeared to be useful in perioperative risk stratification among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> undergoing noncardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
