<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels (Na(V)s) underlie the upstroke of the action potential in the excitable tissues of nerve and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After opening, Na(V)s rapidly undergo inactivation, a crucial process through which <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> conductance is negatively regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of inactivation by inherited mutations is an established cause of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, or painful syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> (Ca(2+)) modulate <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel inactivation, and multiple players have been suggested in this process, including the cytoplasmic Na(V) C-terminal region including two EF-hands and an IQ motif, the Na(V) domain III-IV linker, and calmodulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calmodulin can bind to the IQ domain in both Ca(2+)-bound and Ca(2+)-free conditions, but only to the DIII-IV linker in a Ca(2+)-loaded state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of Ca(2+) regulation, and its composite effect(s) on channel gating, has been shrouded in much controversy owing to numerous apparent experimental inconsistencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, we attempt to summarize these disparate data and propose a novel, to our knowledge, physiological mechanism whereby <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> promote <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current facilitation due to Ca(2+) memory at high-action-potential frequencies where Ca(2+) levels may accumulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The available data suggest that this phenomenon may be disrupted in diseases where cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> levels are chronically high and where targeted phosphorylation may decouple the Ca(2+) regulatory machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many Na(V) disease mutations associated with electrical dysfunction are located in the Ca(2+)-sensing machinery and misregulation of Ca(2+)-dependent channel modulation is likely to contribute to disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
