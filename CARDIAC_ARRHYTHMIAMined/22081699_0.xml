<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We engineered mice in which the phosphomimetic phospholemman S68E mutant (inhibits NCX1 but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase) was constitutively overexpressed in a cardiac-specific manner (conS68E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 4-6 wk, conS68E mice exhibited severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, increased left ventricular (LV) mass, <z:mp ids='MP_0003393'>decreased cardiac output</z:mp> (CO), and ∼50% mortality compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein levels of NCX1, calsequestrin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor, and α(1)- and α(2)-subunits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase were similar, but sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase was lower, whereas L-type Ca(2+) channels were higher in conS68E hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude were similar, but action potential duration was dramatically prolonged in conS68E myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diastolic intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) was higher, [Ca(2+)](i) transient and maximal contraction amplitudes were lower, and half-time of [Ca(2+)](i) transient decline was longer in conS68E myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> reached maximum within 3 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> addition, followed by decline in WT but not in conS68E myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchange, L-type Ca(2+), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase, and depolarization-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents were decreased in conS68E myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 22 wk, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and increased LV mass persisted in conS68E survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite comparable baseline CO, conS68E survivors at 22 wk exhibited decreased chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that constitutive overexpression of S68E mutant was detrimental, both in terms of depressed cardiac function and increased arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
