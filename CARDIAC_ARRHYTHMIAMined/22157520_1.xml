<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data exist concerning the incidence of AF, its impact on mortality, the effectiveness of therapy, and the risk factors of AF after pulmonary transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the medical files of 224 consecutive lung transplant recipients who underwent surgery over a 10-year period at a large Canadian center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected patient characteristics, in-hospital treatments, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-to-event analysis was used to account for in-hospital follow-up and models generated to assess the impact of AF on mortality and independent risk factors of AF after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative AF occurred in 65 patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF was more likely to occur with complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinitis</z:e>, and bronchial dehiscence and was not an independent risk factor of mortality (hazard ratio=1.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-4.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological or electric therapy for rhythm or rate control of AF was administered to 97% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was used in 46%, electric cardioversion in 28%, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient remained in AF at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age (hazard ratio=1.08 by year; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.12), bilateral transplantation (hazard ratio=1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.42), and a history of AF before the transplantation (hazard ratio=4.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-19.11) were found to be independently associated with an increased incidence of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AF is fairly common after pulmonary transplantation, transient, and relatively benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is not independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients return to sinus rhythm before discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Age, prior AF, and bilateral transplantation increase the risk of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
