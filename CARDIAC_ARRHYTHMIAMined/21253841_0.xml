<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, catheter ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is still a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various rather complex ablation strategies exist and their results are not very favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate a well-defined reasonable approach to catheter ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strategy consisted of a circumferential pulmonary vein ablation in combination with a potential-guided segmental approach to achieve complete pulmonary vein isolation and a linear lesion at the roof of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 43 patients (30 men, 13 women; mean age 55 years (SD ± 9 years)) with symptomatic persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent catheter ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> using the above-mentioned approach (with the CARTO or the NAVX system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, catheter ablation of the mitral isthmus and the right atrial isthmus was performed in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, cardiac MRI or multi-detector spiral computed tomography was performed prior to the ablation procedure and a surface rendered model of the left atrium was created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After discharge, patients were scheduled for repeated visits at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> clinic at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ablation procedure could be performed as planned in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had to undergo a repeat ablation procedure, so that a total of 52 procedures were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An additional linear lesion was created at the mitral isthmus in three patients (7%) during the initial procedure and in one patient (2.3%) during the second procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation of the right atrial isthmus was performed in 11 patients (25.6%) during the first procedure and in four additional patients during the redo procedure (9.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four out of 43 patients (55.8%) experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence within the first 3 months after ablation requiring an electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>At 1-year follow-up, analysis of a 7-day Holter monitoring revealed no evidence for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence in 26 of 43 patients (60.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In nine of 43 patients (20.9%), only short episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In eight patients (18.6%), a recurrence of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (&gt;48 h) was revealed by the long-term recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A duration of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> &gt;3 months was the most powerful predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis revealed a markedly higher rate of stable sinus rhythm at 1-year follow-up in patients with a short duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (≤ 3 months) compared to patients with a longer duration of AF (&gt;3 months) prior to the procedure (72.0% versus 44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> can be performed safely and effectively using this ablation strategy (especially in patients with short-lasting persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (≤ 3 months)) </plain></SENT>
