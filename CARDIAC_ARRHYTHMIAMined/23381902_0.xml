<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca(2+) release (IP3ICR) in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) under physiological conditions, as well as under cellular remodelling, remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we test the hypothesis that local IP3ICR directly affects <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR) function and subsequent Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release in atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IP3ICR was evoked by UV-flash photolysis of caged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16595">InsP3</z:chebi> under whole-cell configuration of the voltage-clamp technique in atrial myocytes isolated from C57/BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Photolytic release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16595">InsP3</z:chebi> was accompanied by a significant increase in the Ca(2+) release event frequency (4.14 ± 0.72 vs. 6.20 ± 0.76 events (100 μm)(-1) s(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These individual photolytically triggered Ca(2+) release events were identified as Ca(2+) sparks, which originated from RyR openings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was verified by Ca(2+) spark analysis and pharmacological separation between RyR and InsP3R-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-Ca(2+) release (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi>, xestospongin C, tetracaine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant SR-Ca(2+) flux but eventless SR-Ca(2+) release through InsP3R were characterized using SR-Ca(2+) leak/SR-Ca(2+) load measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results strongly support the idea that IP3ICR can effectively modulate RyR openings and Ca(2+) spark probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that eventless and highly efficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16595">InsP3</z:chebi>-dependent SR-Ca(2+) flux is the main mechanism of functional cross-talk between InsP3Rs and RyRs, which may be an important factor in the modulation of ECC sensitivity </plain></SENT>
