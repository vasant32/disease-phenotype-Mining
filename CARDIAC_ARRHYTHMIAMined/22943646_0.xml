<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment experience of patients with non-<z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary cardiac tumors</z:e> accompanied with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and imaging data as well as therapy efficacy and outcome were analyzed in 10 patients with non-<z:mp ids='MP_0003391'>myxomas</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary cardiac tumors</z:e> accompanied with refractory VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5 male and 5 female patients in this cohort [mean age (37.6±18.2) years] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Palpitation was presented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients, 7 patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and 2 patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376288" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amaurosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by combined use of transthoracic echocardiograms, MRI, and CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time from symptom to diagnosis was (33.2±36.7) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptom-related VT was documented by ECG or Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipoma</z:hpo> in 7 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 1 patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010614'>fibroma</z:hpo> in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were located in the left ventricle, 1 in right atria, 1 at peri-aortic root and 1 near right ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 10 patients received anti-arrhythmic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ventricular tachyarrhythmia disappeared after surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients who were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs, radiofrequency ablation or subtotal excision showed only suboptimal efficacy during (39.4±25.1) months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> removal is the best treatment strategy for the treatment of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in patients with primary cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
