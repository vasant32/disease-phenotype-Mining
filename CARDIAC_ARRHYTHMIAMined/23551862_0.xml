<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the spectrum of types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> has been reported, there has been no previous population-based study of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to define the population incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We based this study on the Northern Region of England with a resident population of 3.1 million and an annual live birth rate of 33 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in infants in 1991-2010 from the regional cardiac database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> diagnoses were based on analysis of the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infants with only the substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (such as QT prolongation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular pre-excitation</z:hpo>) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 20 years, there were 662 698 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 162 cases of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of which 22 had associated structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>cardiovascular malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 24.4 per 100 000 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011688'>atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia</z:hpo> with an incidence of 16.3 per 100 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> both occurred at 2.1 cases per 100 000 live births, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report a population incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in infants </plain></SENT>
