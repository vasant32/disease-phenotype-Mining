<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary veins are a major source of ectopic activities initiating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and the fibrillatory conduction, associating multiple wavelets and high frequency functional reentries called "rotors" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF is responsible for atrial electrophysiological, contractile and structural remodelling, shortening the wavelength, accelerating AF cycle length and sustaining the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> led to new therapeutic approaches, including ablation, and could eventually lead to the development of new anti-arrhythmic drug agents </plain></SENT>
