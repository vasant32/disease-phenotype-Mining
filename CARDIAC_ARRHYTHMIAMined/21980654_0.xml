<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors for NA occurrence after AP ablation and to investigate pro-arrhythmic effect of RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total of 124 patients (88 males, mean age 43 +/- 14 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> and single AP have been followed after successful RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-ablation finding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, not recorded before the procedure, was considered a NA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The origin of NA was assessed by analysis of P-wave and/or QRS-complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and, thereafter, it was compared with locations of previously ablated APs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the follow-up of 4.3 +/- 3.9 years, NA was registered in 20 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of specific NAs was as follows: atrioventricular (AV) block 0.8%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial premature beats</z:e> 1.6%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> 5.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> 0.8%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> 4.8%, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>) 7.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox-regression analysis identified (1) pre-ablation history of pathway-mediated tachyarrhythmias &gt;10 years (HR = 3.54, p = 0.016) and (2) septal AP location (HR = 4.25, p = 0.003), as the independent predictors for NA occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four NA cases (two cases of septal <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>, one of typical AFL and one of <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV-block</z:mp>) presumed NA origin was identified in the vicinity of previous ablation target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NAs were found in 16% of patients after AP elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In few of these cases, late on-site arrhythmic effect of initially curative RF lesion might be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While earlier intervention could prevent NA occurrence, closer follow-up is advised after ablation of septal AP </plain></SENT>
