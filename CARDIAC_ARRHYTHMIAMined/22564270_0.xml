<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Though <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> permanently; there is not enough data about the prevalence, frequency of risk factors, and adequacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prevalence of AF, the frequency of risk factors, adequacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in patients who were admitted to our outpatient tertiary cardiology clinic according to current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients, admitted to our Cardiology outpatient clinic between January - June 2010 and had a history of AF were included to the study retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' demographic findings, clinical AF classification, CHA2DS2VASC scores, treatments the measured INR values in last 12 months retrospectively and the success of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 432 (9.1%) of 4721 patients had AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among them 253 (58.5%) patients were female, mean age was 70.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Permanent AF was the most common type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common risk factor was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (71.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CHA2DS2VASC score was â‰¥ 2 in 377 patients (87.2%) and 254 (67.3%) of those patients had absolutely indicated for anticoagulation therapy, were taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 37 patients with one risk factor, and 10 of 18 patients without risk factors were also receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was indicated in 123 patients, 36 patients had contraindications, 13 patients refused anticoagulation, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was stopped in 5 patients because of noncompliance with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>15.9% of patients were not on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> although anticoagulation was indicated and no contraindication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>83.5% patients INR levels were between therapeutic ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation is applied successfully among an important part of AF patients in our tertiary center, but in a substantial group of patients the guidelines are still not implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>New, cost-effective, safe, accessible treatments are needed for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> contraindicated patients </plain></SENT>
