<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many types of cardiovascular complications such as; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, impaired cardiac function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and decreased left ventricular function, have been attributed to interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of combination therapy pegylated interferon and ribavirin on left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients, eligible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a full cardiovascular baseline examination including; detailed medical history, thorough clinical examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cardiac evaluation was performed at the beginning and six months after starting combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant changes regarding cardiac symptoms including; <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp>, cough, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, were found during or six months after starting the combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG findings showed statistically non-significant decreases in the QT interval, while corrected QT showed statistically non-significant increases six months after beginning combined therapy, when compared to their values before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also with regard to the echocardiography findings, there was no statistically significant difference found between any of the echocardiography parameters six months after starting combined therapy compared to their values before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that, combination therapy does not cause a significant deterioration in cardiac function in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and it may be used safely in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
