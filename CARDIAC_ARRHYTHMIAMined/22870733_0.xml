<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF fulfils many of the criteria for a screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data about the prevalence of AF in non-hospitalized patients are available in Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess feasibility and effectiveness of a nationwide-organized voluntary screening programme in the general population in Belgium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 13.564 participants were screened, of whom 10,758 were older than 40 years (GSP group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants filled in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk stratification questionnaires (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A one-lead electrocardiogram was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 228 participants had AF at the time of screening (AF group), with 125 women and 103 men (i.e., 1.9% and 2.6% of total women and men), representing a prevalence of 2.2% (95% CI 1.3% and 3.0%) of the screened population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age of the AF group was 67 +/- 12 y (range 40-87 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using the CHADS2-score, 58% of participants with a positive AF screening had a high risk score, and 21% had an intermediate risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the CHA2DS2-VASc-score, 72% of the participants had a high risk score, and 21% had an intermediate risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AF was present in 2.2% of the respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At least 60% of AF group had an increased risk for thrombo-embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although substantial methodological issues limit the exact interpretation of these results, the present study shows that a volunatry screening programme with a simple screening protocol is able to detect an important number of patients with previously undetected AF </plain></SENT>
