<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cardiac dysfunction is one of the main cause of drug candidate failures in the preclinical and/or clinical studies and responsible for the retraction of large number of drugs from the market </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prediction of arrhythmic risk based on preclinical trials during drug development remains limited despite intensive and costly investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, methods for analyzing beating behavior of cardiomyocytes (CMs) in culture to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are not well developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, we combined two emerging technologies, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived CMs and impedance-based real-time (xCELLigence RTCA Cardio Instrument) monitoring of CM electrical activity, to assess the effect of drugs known affect cardiac activity such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">carbachol</z:chebi>, terfenadine, sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells were exposed to a drug in a single dose or repeated dose scenarios and data were analyzed using RTCA Cardio software, Poincar√© plot and detrended fluctuation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results revealed significant changes in beating parameters of iPS-CMs induced by reference compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heptanol, gap junction blocker, completely disrupted the synchronous beating pattern of iPS-CMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decrease of beating rate, amplitude and beat-to-beat signal variations of iPS-CMs monolayer observed in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> revealed severe abnormality detected by the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the irregular beating rhythms recorded in the presence of Terfenadine and Sotalol at high concentration, reflect abnormalities in cell contraction and/or relaxation which may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these results indicated that xCELLigence RTCA Cardio system combined with iPS cells, has the potential to be an attractive high-throughput tool for studying CMs during prolonged culture times and to screen potential drugs for cardiotoxic side effects </plain></SENT>
