<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven centres responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rhythm control was preferred in patients with significant AF-related symptoms by 73% of centres, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after a first detected episode by 59%, and in young patients even if AF was well tolerated by 49% of centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common strategy after successful conversion of the first AF episode was a 'wait-and-see' approach without initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional Î²-blockers were always or sometimes used as first-choice drugs for AF prevention by 76% of centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 11% used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> regularly as a first-choice drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic work-up for exclusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> prior to initiation of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Markers monitored for proarrhythmia risk were QRS duration for class IC drugs (68%) and the QT interval for sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, rhythm control is more widely employed than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beta-blockers are widely used for AF prevention in contrast to the limited use of the new drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
