<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These poor outcomes persist despite improvements in the modalities employed as well as an enhanced understanding of the effects of the extracorporeal circuit, anticoagulation, treatment doses, fluid replacement and dialysis membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, there has been an emerging appreciation that intermittent RRT (in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> maintenance haemodialysis setting) is capable of generating sufficient circulatory stress to propagate additional widespread end-organ injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mitigation of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001050'>plethora</z:hpo> of risks by the correct identification of complications, targeting of therapy refinements and prediction, whilst problems still remain occult, is desirable and becoming increasingly possible in the pursuit of improved outcomes in this high-mortality therapeutic field </plain></SENT>
