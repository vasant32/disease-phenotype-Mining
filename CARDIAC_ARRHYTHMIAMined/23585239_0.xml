<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular complications are a known risk of catheter-based pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVAI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> necessitate full-dose anticoagulation, which worsens outcomes in the event of vascular access injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Real-time ultrasound allows direct visualization of vascular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that ultrasound use with venipuncture reduces vascular complications associated with PVAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adverse events occurring with PVAI was performed during two periods: 2005-2006 when ultrasound was not used and 2008-2010 when ultrasound was routinely employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received full-dose IV <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during PVAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the no ultrasound cohort, only 14 % underwent PVAI without stopping <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, while 91 % of patients in the ultrasound cohort were on continued <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only patients deemed at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with a periprocedural international normalized ratio (INR) less than 2 were bridged with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound reduced total vascular complications (1.7 vs. 0.5 %, p &lt; 0.01) and decreased the incidence of major vascular complications by sevenfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> with INR ≥ 1.2 on the day of PVAI was associated with more vascular complications (4.3 vs. 1.2 %, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound guidance overcame the risk associated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vascular complications in anticoagulated patients with INR ≥ 1.2 using ultrasound guidance were two- and ninefold lower than those in patients not using ultrasound with an INR &lt; 1.2 (0.5 vs. 1.2 %, p &lt; 0.05) and INR ≥ 1.2 (0.5 vs. 4.3 %, p &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided venipuncture improves the safety profile of PVAI, reducing vascular complications in patients on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> to levels below those with no ultrasound and off <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
