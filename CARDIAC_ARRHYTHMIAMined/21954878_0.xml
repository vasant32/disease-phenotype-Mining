<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) is a complex disease where multiple factors may induce left-atrial structural remodeling (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the differential SR of the left-atrial posterior wall (LAPW) of patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> with or without persistent AF, and the expression of key proteins involved in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Light microscopy of LAPW samples from 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and persistent AF (group 1), 33 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in sinus rhythm (group 2), and 15 autopsy controls (group 3) was used to measure myocyte diameter, percentage of myocytolytic myocytes, interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and capillary density; RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to assess the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels of SOD-1, SOD-2, HO-1, calpain, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and VEGF; immunofluorescence was used to locate these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocyte diameter was similar in groups 1 and 2, but larger than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to group 2, group 1 had more myocytolytic myocytes (20.8 ± 5.6% vs 14.7 ± 4.5%; P &lt; 0.0001), increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (10.4 ± 5.1% vs 7.5 ± 4.2%; P &lt; 0.05), and decreased capillary density (923 ± 107 No/mm(2) vs 1,040 ± 100 No/mm(2); P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the proteins were more expressed in groups 1 and 2 than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of SOD-1, SOD-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were higher in group 1 than in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The LAPW of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients with or without AF shows considerable SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The former has more severe histopathological changes and higher levels of proteins involved in SR, thereby reaching a threshold beyond which the sinus impulse cannot normally activate atrial myocardium </plain></SENT>
