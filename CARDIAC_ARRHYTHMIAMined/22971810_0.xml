<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined oxidative damage in I/R injury and investigated the correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and impaired cardiac function after I/R injury of the isolated rat heart.Methods: Hearts isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hearts arrested using St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thomas cardioplegic solution and then they were reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hearts were divided into three groups depending on the frequency (0-2) of I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After I/R, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), positive maximum left ventricular developing pressure (max LV dP/dt) and coronary flow (CF) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">Creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) was measured in the coronary effluent and 8-hydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">Adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) was measured from frozen myocardial tissue after experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: We immunohistochemically demonstrated and quantified levels of 8-OHdG after I/R injury of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of I/R injury and cardiac dysfunction significantly and negatively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ATP products were similar among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was not by affected <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>.Conclusion: The frequency of I/R injury had more of an effect on 8-OHdG products and on impaired cardiac function with less myocyte damage than ischemic duration within 30 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
