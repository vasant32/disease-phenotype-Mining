<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of these diseases may be partially explained by the presence of common risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the effect of AF on the prognosis in HF is still debatable, it is associated with specific complications and affects therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate epidemiology and management of coexisting HF and AF among Polish outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study was performed within the framework of the Polish National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Disease</z:e> Prevention and Treatment Program, POLKARD 2003-2005, and included patients with HF treated in a representative number of 400 outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was collected using questionnaires and included demographic characteristics as well as information about coexisting diseases and treatment, provided by patients and physicians on the basis of the available medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study involved 3682 patients with HF (mean age 67.1 ±11.7 years; 58% of patients were men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF was present in 38% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> increased with the New York Heart Association class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed significant differences between the subgroups of patients with AF and those with sinus rhythm in terms of demographic parameters, risk factors, concomitant diseases, and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi> and β-blockers was significantly lower in the subgroup with AF, a multivariable analysis showed that it was associated with specific demographic characteristics and comorbidities rather than with arrythmia itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specialty patient care was associated with increased use of therapy aimed to improve the prognosis of HF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF constitute a particular subgroup within the population of patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A specific distribution of risk factors with a significant effect of noncardiac diseases may confound HF therapy in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Specialty care may be able to optimize treatment in patients with coexisting HF and AF </plain></SENT>
