<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CTSS with OTSS for mechanically ventilated patients home and abroad were identified via manual and computer retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> related data were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta analysis was conducted using the statistical software RevMan 5.1 on the basis of strict quality evaluation with the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one related papers were found and 12 RCTs involving 1205 patients in CTSS group and 1179 patients in OTSS group were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of meta analysis showed that CTSS was associated with a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD = -0.73, 95%CI -1.07 - -0.40, P &lt; 0.0001), but the incidence of ventilator associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and microbial colonization, mortality and length of ICU stay exhibited no difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, compared with OTSS, CTSS reduced the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RR = 0.23, 95%CI 0.07 - 0.74, P = 0.01) and minimized the disturbance to heart rate (WMD = -1.97, 95%CI -3.03 - -0.91, P = 0.0003), mean arterial pressure (WMD = -2.01, 95%CI -3.02 - -1.01, P &lt; 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) (WMD = -1.00, 95%CI -1.14 - -0.86, P &lt; 0.000 01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with OTSS, CTSS could reduce disturbance to respiratory and circulatory system by sputum suction and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CTSS has no advantage in prevention of ventilator associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or microbial colonization, nor does it shorten the length of ICU stay or improve the outcome of mechanically ventilated patients </plain></SENT>
