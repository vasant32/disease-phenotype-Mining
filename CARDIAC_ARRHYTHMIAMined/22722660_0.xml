<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sites of high dominant frequency (DF(peak)) are thought to indicate the location of drivers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), but characterization of their spatiotemporal distribution and stability, critical to their relevance as targets for catheter ablation, requires simultaneous global mapping of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Noncontact electrograms recorded simultaneously from 256 left atrial sites during spontaneous AF were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After subtraction of the ventricular component, fast Fourier transform identified the DF at each site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal areas of DF(peak) were defined as those having a DF &gt;20% above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neighboring sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with spontaneous AF (11 paroxysmal and 13 persistent) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In paroxysmal AF, sites of DF(peak) (mean DF, 11.6±2.9 Hz) were observed in 100% of patients (present during 65% of the mapping period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, DF(peak) was detected in only 31% of patients with persistent AF (P&lt;0.001) and for only 5% of the mapping period (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, locations of DF(peak) varied widely in both consecutive and separated segments of AF (κ coefficient range, -0.07-0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation sequences around sites of DF(peak) did not demonstrate centrifugal activation that would be expected from focal drivers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Focal areas of high DF are more frequent in paroxysmal than persistent AF, are spatiotemporally unstable, are not the source of centrifugal activation, and are not, therefore, indicative of fixed drivers of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the absence of spatiotemporal stability, the success of ablation at sites of DF(peak) cannot be explained by elimination of fixed drivers </plain></SENT>
