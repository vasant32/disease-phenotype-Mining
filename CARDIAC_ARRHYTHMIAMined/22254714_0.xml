<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, but the mechanism for that outcome has not been exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endocardial electrograms were recorded during spontaneous episodes of CSR and PB in patients in conscious and unconscious states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis exposed a regular bidirectional phase-walk in the relationship between respiration and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently developed signal processing techniques revealed that respiration also modulates cardiac repolarization properties at multiple simultaneous frequencies, and the effect was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> across measurement sites in both ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These measurements offer unique evidence of the electro-physiological manifestations of these breathing patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of phase relationships suggested a mechanism by which the behavior may predispose patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such predisposition would be easily measured to direct treatment priorities and improve risk stratification </plain></SENT>
