<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five additional loci have been associated primarily with the PR interval and subsequently with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate if 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), representing the 8 genomic loci previously linked with AF in genome-wide association studies, were associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 209 patients with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF, and a control group consisting of 534 individuals free of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 8 SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three SNPs were found to be significantly associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF: rs2200733 closest to PITX2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-2.27; P = 0.004), rs3807989 near to CAV1 (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.72; P = 0.015), and rs11047543 near to SOX5 (OR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.18-2.44; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When correcting for multiple testing, rs2200733 and rs11047543 were still significantly associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three SNPs, rs2200733 (4q25), rs3807989 (7p31), and rs11047543 (12p12), were associated with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 SNPs are positioned close to genes that in previous studies have been demonstrated to be important for cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>/development, thereby suggesting a link between these SNPs and structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results however, indicate that variants in these 3 loci are associated with AF through mechanisms that do not involve major structural abnormalities in the heart </plain></SENT>
