<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes of pulmonary vein isolation alone and pulmonary vein isolation plus the use of complex fractionated electrogram-guided ablation (CFEA) have not been fully compared in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>.This prospective study included 70 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> that remained inducible after pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For radio-frequency catheter ablation, patients were nonrandomly assigned to a control group (pulmonary vein isolation alone, Group 1, n=35) or a CFEA group (pulmonary vein isolation plus additional CFEA, Group 2, n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The times to first recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias were compared between the 2 groups.In Group 2, CFEA rendered <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> noninducible in 16 patients (45.7%) and converted inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> into inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutters</z:hpo> in 12 patients (34.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> remained inducible in 7 patients (20%) after the combined ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 23 months, freedom from recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the recurrent tachyarrhythmias were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, whereas regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was the major mechanism of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in Group 2 (atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in 5 of 6 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 1 patient).We found that CFEA after pulmonary vein isolation significantly reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia and might modify the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
