<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report photocontrol of excitation of cultured cardiomyocytes that have been made light sensitive by using the addition of azobenzene trimethylammonium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (AzoTAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trans-isomer of AzoTAB reversibly suppresses spontaneous activity and propagation of excitation waves, whereas the cis-isomer has no detectable effect on the electrical properties of cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Photoisomerization of AzoTAB was achieved by switching the illumination wavelength, Î», from ~440 nm (trans-isomer) to ~350 nm (cis-isomer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous irradiation at two wavelengths with properly chosen intensities allowed for dynamic control of the cis-isomer/trans-isomer ratio and the level of excitability from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to fully unexcitable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted by using AzoTAB-treated confluent monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excitation waves were monitored by using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-sensitive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51103">Fluo-4</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By projecting two-wavelength illumination patterns onto otherwise uniform cell layers, we were able to create excitable networks with the desired topology, dimensions, and functional properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present article discusses potential applications of this technique for the analysis of complex patterns of electrical excitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
