<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the potential associations of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/ deletion (I/D) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> synthase (CYP11B2) gene -344T/C polymorphisms with the risk and recurrence of lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-three patients who underwent successful catheter ablation for lone AF were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and ninety-seven sinus rhythm subjects without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjects were genotyped for ACE gene I/D and CYP11B2 gene -344T/C polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the ACE gene DD genotype and D allele were associated with a greater prevalence of lone AF (both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ACE gene DD genotype had a significantly larger left atrial dimension (LAD; 41.6±5.7 mm vs. 39.6±5.2 mm; P=0.043) and higher risk of AF recurrence [44.7% vs. 23.2%; odds ratio (OR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-5.61; P=0.008] compared with the II+ID genotype in lone AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for a variety of risk factors, the ACE gene DD genotype had a 1.97-fold increased risk for lone AF (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.15-3.37; P= 0.013) and 2.35-fold increased risk for AF recurrence (RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.10-5.04; P=0.028) compared with the ACE gene II+ID genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation between the CYP11B2 gene -344T/C polymorphism and lone AF or its recurrence was observed in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the ACE gene DD genotype was associated with an increased incidence of lone AF and its recurrence following ablation, which was partly mediated by LAD </plain></SENT>
