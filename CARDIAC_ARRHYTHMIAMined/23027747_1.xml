<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work describes the purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the CBS-domain pair of the murine CNNM2 <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> transporter (formerly known as ancient domain protein 2; ACDP2), which consists of a pair of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> β-synthase (CBS) motifs and has 100% sequence identity to its human homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CNNM proteins represent the least-studied members of the eight different types of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> transporters identified to date in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, the CNNM family is encoded by four genes: CNNM1-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CNNM1 acts as a cytosolic copper chaperone, whereas CNNM2 and CNNM4 have been associated with <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mutations in the CNNM2 gene cause familial dominant hypomagnesaemia (MIM:607803), a rare human disorder characterized by renal and intestinal <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg(2+)) <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp>, which may lead to symptoms of Mg(2+) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001281'>tetany</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This manuscript describes the preliminary crystallographic analysis of two different crystal habits of a truncated form of the protein containing its regulatory CBS-domain pair, which has been reported to host the pathological mutation T568I in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The crystals belonged to space groups P2(1)2(1)2 and I222 (or I2(1)2(1)2(1)) and diffracted X-rays to 2.0 and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively, using synchrotron radiation </plain></SENT>
