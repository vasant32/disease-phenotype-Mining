<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability (HRV), arterial blood pressure (MAP), and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) were recorded during supine (SUP) and passive head up tilt (HUT) in eight healthy humans, spontaneously breathing either room air or 10 % <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the time domain, heart rate increased and variability decreased with HUT in both trials, with no difference between trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the frequency domain, normalized low frequency HRV increased, and normalized high frequency HRV decreased with HUT in both trials, with no difference between trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAP was 74.9 (8.6) and 77.5 (11.7) mmHg when SUP in the room air and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> trials, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in MAP occurred with HUT in the room air trial but not in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both trials, end tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> decreased with HUT, with no difference between trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the room air trial, end tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> increased with HUT, whereas during the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> trial, end tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> decreased with HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution of heart beats relative to the phase of ventilation (%HB(IN) and %HB(OUT)) was similar in both trials: the %HB(IN) was 43.5 (3.3) % and %HB(OUT) was 56.5 (4.2) % breathing room air when SUP, and 45.5 (3.0) and 54.5 (3.2) when hypoxic and SUP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For both trials, this distribution did not change with HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As both HRV and RSA showed similar responses to HUT when spontaneously breathing either room air or 10 % <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi>, we suggest that autonomic cardiovascular reflexes are preserved during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
