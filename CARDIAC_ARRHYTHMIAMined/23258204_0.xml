<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the last decade new insights regarding AF genetic background have been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial aggregation suggesting a potential heritability was well known in the pre-molecular era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Now, research on the molecular basis of the disease is providing evidence that familial AF is mostly autosomal, both dominant and recessive, and genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in several disease genes with different functional effects may be associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early results encourage family studies and monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, genome-wide association studies have recently identified common polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of AF in different large populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies are contributing to provide early answers, but also raise new questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this review we analyze existing knowledge on genetics of AF and related potential clinical impact </plain></SENT>
