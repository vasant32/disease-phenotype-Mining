<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:  We hypothesized that α-2 AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> would have an inhibitory effect on abnormal repolarization-related ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, the effects of 2 clinically available α-2 AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>) on the occurrence of VTs were assessed in a methoxamine-sensitized rabbit model of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (Study 1: n=45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control rabbits, administration of methoxamine and nifekalant almost invariably caused VTs (14/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, incidence of VT significantly decreased during the treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> (1μg·kg(-1)·min(-1): 5/12 [P&lt;0.01 vs. control]) or with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> (33.3μg·kg(-1)·min(-1): 10/18 [P&lt;0.01]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To verify that VTs in this animal model are triggered by early afterdepolarization (EAD), the monophasic action potential on the left ventricular surface was recorded in 28 open-chest rabbits (Study 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EAD-like hump was less frequently detected during treatment with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> (2/14) than in saline-treated rabbits (9/10, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presence of a hump was significantly related to the advent of VTs (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:  Agents with α-2 AR agonistic action have an inhibitory effect on VTs in a rabbit model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alpha-2 AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi>, may be a therapeutic choice for abnormal repolarization-related VTs that are resistant to conventional treatment.  </plain></SENT>
