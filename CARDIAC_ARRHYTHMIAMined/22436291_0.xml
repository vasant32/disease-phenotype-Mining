<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated myocardial protection by human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (hANP) during cardiac surgery without cardioplegia and determined whether suppression of myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury by hANP allows intraoperative aortic cross-clamp time to be prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two pigs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental pigs were divided into 4 groups: 15 min clamping; hANP 15 min clamping; 30 min clamping; and hANP 30 min clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both hANP groups, a 100 Î¼g dose of hANP was administered after clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>), histopathological studies, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi>, myocardial Ca(2+), and ATP concentrations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the myocardial contractile force indicator E(max), in the 30 min groups, showed a significantly higher recovery rate in the hANP than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> numbers were significantly lower in the hANP than in the control groups for both arrest durations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On microscopic examination, hANP reduced ischemic reperfusion injury in the 30 min groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The myocardial ATP level was significantly higher in the hANP 30 min than in the control 30 min group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> and myocardial Ca(2+) concentrations were significantly inhibited in both hANP groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hANP ameliorates ischemic reperfusion injury, improves postoperative myocardial contractility, and reduces reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that hANP allows aortic cross-clamping to be prolonged and thereby exerts a direct myocardial protective effect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
