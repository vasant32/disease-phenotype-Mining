<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Premarket evaluation of CIEDs cannot be expected to eliminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> performance defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Robust postmarket surveillance systems are needed to promote patient safety and reduce harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Challenges impacting existing surveillance mechanisms include underreporting of defects, low rates of return of explanted CIEDs, lack of integration of surveillance into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> workflow, underutilization of existing resources including registries, a lack of capacity of aging resources, multiple proprietary platforms that lack interoperability, and the unmet need for common data variables as well as newer methods to generate, synthesize, analyze, and interpret evidence in order to respond rapidly to safety signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term solutions include establishing a unique device identification system; promoting expanded use of registries for surveillance and post-approval studies; developing additional methods to combine evidence from diverse data sources; creating tools and implementing strategies for universal automatic, triggered electronic event reporting; and refining methods to rapidly identify and interpret safety signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protection from litigation and creation of financial and other incentives by legislators, regulators, payers, accreditation organizations, and licensing boards can be expanded to increase participation in device surveillance by clinicians and health care facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Research to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of surveillance strategies is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interim solutions to improve CIED surveillance while new initiatives are launched and the system strengthened are also presented </plain></SENT>
