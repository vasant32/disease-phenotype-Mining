<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found between the 1 minute and 5 minute parameters for maximal-RR, minimal-RR, average-RR, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, and total power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, a good correlation between 10 second and 5 minute parameters was found for maximal-RR, minimal-RR, average-RR, and RMSSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that certain ultra-short HRV parameters can be used efficiently in DM patients for autonomic evaluation </plain></SENT>
