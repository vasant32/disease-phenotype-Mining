<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether T-wave alternans (TWA) level is correlated with nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) incidence in association with PCI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed continuous 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 48 STEMI patients during and after successful primary PCI, achieving Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) grade 3 flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TWA was measured using modified moving average method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum TWA was elevated in patients with (N = 22) compared to without (N = 26) NSVT (75.1 ± 6.3 vs 49.9 ± 3.6 μV, P &lt; 0.005) during the 22-hour monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TWA ≥ 60μV predicted NSVT with sensitivity of 77%; specificity, 73%; positive predictive value, 71%; and negative predictive value, 79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.87 for maximum TWA in predicting NSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By comparison, ST-segment levels did not differ in patients with versus without NSVT and were not predictive (AUC = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TWA was elevated prior to PCI and remained elevated at 30 minutes after balloon inflation despite restoration of TIMI grade 3 flow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, declining by 22 hours (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maximum ST-segment levels decreased from before PCI to 30 minutes after balloon inflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TWA is regionally specific, with higher values prior to PCI in precordial lead V5 than in V1 for left coronary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TWA may be useful in identifying individuals at heightened risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in association with primary PCI and can potentially signal time-dependent changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vulnerability </plain></SENT>
