<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Late lesion extension may be involved in the genesis of delayed radiofrequency (RF) effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because RF lesion is thermally mediated, we hypothesized that induction of heat shock response (thermotolerance) would modulate lesion healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of thermotolerance on the dimensions and remodeling of RF lesions in a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats (weight 300 g) subjected to heat stress (n = 22, internal temperature of 42 °C for 10 min) were compared to controls (n = 22, internal temperature of 37 °C for 10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 48 h (peak of HSP70 myocardial concentration), a modified unipolar RF lesion (customized catheter, tip 4.5 mm in diameter; 12 W; 10 s) was created on the left ventricular free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 2 h (n = 10 per group) and 4 weeks (n = 12 per group) after ablation for lesion analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An echocardiogram was obtained at 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference between groups regarding the size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (controls 27 ± 2 vs. treated 27 ± 3 mm(2)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesions (controls 17 ± 1 vs. treated 19 ± 1 mm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histology of lesions did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The echocardiogram revealed dilation of the cavities and moderate systolic dysfunction without difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> lesion dimensions were similar between control and treated animals over time (ablation undertaken 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>) and also using a conventional ablation catheter (50 °C; 15 W; 10 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thermotolerance does not reduce the size or remodeling of RF lesions in the rat myocardium </plain></SENT>
