<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HRAS mutations predicting p.Gly12Val, p.Gly12Asp, and p.Gly12Cys substitutions have been associated with severe, lethal, CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on molecular, clinical, and pathological findings in patients with mutations predicting HRAS p.Gly12Val that were identified in our clinical molecular genetic testing service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such mutations were identified in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, three were deletion/insertion mutations affecting coding <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 35 and 36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients died within 6 postnatal weeks, providing further evidence that p.Gly12Val mutations predict a very poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High birth weight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> (and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo>), <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth failure</z:hpo> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dysmorphism was subtle or non-specific, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, coarsened facial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011220'>prominent forehead</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005280'>depressed nasal bridge</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000463'>anteverted nares</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000369'>low-set ears</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0005753'>limb shortening</z:hpo>, a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001591'>bell-shaped chest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001883'>talipes</z:hpo>, and fixed flexion deformities of the wrists were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neonatal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, highly suggestive of CS, was also present in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had congenital alveolar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and another, born after 36 weeks' gestation, bronchopulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A rapidly fatal disease course, and the difficulty of identifying subtle dysmorphism in neonates requiring intensive care, suggest that this condition remains under-recognized, and should enter the differential diagnosis for very sick infants with a range of clinical problems including <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and disordered pulmonary development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical management should be informed by knowledge of the poor prognosis of this condition </plain></SENT>
