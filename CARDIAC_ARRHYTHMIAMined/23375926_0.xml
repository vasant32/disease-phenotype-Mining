<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Yoga is known to have significant benefit on cardiovascular health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of yoga in reducing AF burden is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This single-center, pre-post study enrolled patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF with an initial 3-month noninterventional observation period followed by twice-weekly 60-min yoga training for next 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF episodes during the control and study periods as well as SF-36, Zung self-rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and Zung self-rated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores at baseline, before, and after the study phase were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Yoga training reduced symptomatic AF episodes (3.8 ± 3 vs. 2.1 ± 2.6, p &lt; 0.001), symptomatic non-AF episodes (2.9 ± 3.4 vs. 1.4 ± 2.0; p &lt; 0.001), asymptomatic AF episodes (0.12 ± 0.44 vs. 0.04 ± 0.20; p &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), and improved the QoL parameters of physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health domains on SF-36 (p = 0.017, p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.019, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was significant decrease in heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after yoga (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with paroxysmal AF, yoga improves symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden, heart rate, blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, and several domains of QoL </plain></SENT>
