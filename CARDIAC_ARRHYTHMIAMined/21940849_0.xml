<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if exercise (Ex) protects hearts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> oxidation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two experimental groups: sedentary controls (Sed) or short-term Ex (10 days of treadmill running) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the last session, hearts were excised and exposed to either perfusion with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> oxidant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> (200 Î¼M) or global I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ex significantly delayed the time to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> after irreversible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a shorter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> perfusion protocol with washout, Ex significantly decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, as evidenced by a delayed time to the first observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores, and lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ex hearts exposed to I/R (30-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/30-min reperfusion) also showed lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> compared with Sed counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our finding that Ex protected intact hearts from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> oxidation was corroborated in isolated ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In myocytes from Ex animals, both the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> fluorescence and incidence of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were delayed after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there were no baseline differences in reduced-to-oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> ratios (GSH/GSSG) between the Sed and Ex groups, GSH/GSSG was better preserved in Ex groups after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> perfusion and I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase activity was significantly enhanced after Ex, and this was preserved in the Ex group after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48958">diamide</z:chebi> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that Ex protects the heart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after two different oxidative stressors and support the hypothesis that sustaining the GSH/GSSG pool stabilizes cardiac electrical function during conditions of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
