<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the rate of persistent AF termination achievable with a stepwise ablation strategy, the predictors of AF termination, and the clinical outcomes associated with termination and nontermination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 143 consecutive patients (age 62 ± 9 years, AF duration 5.7 ± 5.2 years) with persistent and longstanding persistent AF resistant to antiarrhythmic medication who presented in AF for catheter ablation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablation was done with a stepwise approach, including pulmonary vein isolation, followed by complex fractionated atrial electrogram ablation and ablation of resultant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was then performed after a 2-month blanking period to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence, defined as AF or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> lasting ≥ 30 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AF termination by ablation was achieved in 95 (66%) of the 143 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of AF termination included longer baseline AF cycle length (p &lt;0.001) and smaller left atrial size (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF termination by ablation was associated with both a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence after a single procedure without antiarrhythmic drugs (p = 0.01) and overall clinical success (single or multiple procedures, with or without antiarrhythmic drugs; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the predictors of overall clinical success included AF termination by ablation (p = 0.001), a shorter ablation duration (p = 0.002), younger age (p = 0.02), male gender (p = 0.03), and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, among patients with persistent AF, termination of AF by ablation can be achieved in most patients and is associated with reduced recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
