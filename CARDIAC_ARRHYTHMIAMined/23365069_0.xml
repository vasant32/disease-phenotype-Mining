<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat (NNT) are considered by many to be the most appropriate figures to use for the informed consent process, yet the results of published implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) trials are frequently presented as relative risk reduction or odds ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The period over which risk reduction is calculated also varies between trials, making comparison difficult.METHODS AND RESULTS: Published <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> trials used to formulate national and international guidelines were examined for 1, 2, and 3 year total mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and medically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of patients enrolled and at risk at these time points were also sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Where the raw data were not included in the original text, estimates were taken from published Kaplan-Meier graphs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight primary prevention (PP) trials, three secondary prevention (SP) trials, and one SP meta-analyses were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For PP, ARR at 3-year follow-up ranged from 0 (no benefit) to 24.6% (NNT = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For SP, ARR at 3-year follow up ranged from 3.7% (NNT = 27) to 11.3% (NNT = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Absolute risk reduction increased with follow-up in PP trials, whereas there was considerable variation in SP trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, very few trial patients received 3-year follow-up, giving wide confidence intervals (CIs).CONCLUSION: Absolute risk reduction from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> trials varies significantly depending upon trial entry criteria, subgroup characteristics, and duration of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relatively small number of patients followed for 2 or more years leads to wide CIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations, the standardized ARR and NNT data presented may give a more individualized estimate of risk/benefit that could potentially aid an informed consent process </plain></SENT>
