<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are associated with an increased mortality risk in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about risk stratification in the specific group of adult patients with CHD and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify predictors of mortality in adult with CHD and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to establish a risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study involved 378 adult patients with CHD (mean age 39 Â± 13 years) and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> who had serial follow-up in a tertiary referral center from 1999 through 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, there were 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality rate was 2.0% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Common modes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (20%), and perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of mortality were poor functional class (hazard ratio 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.69 to 8.03, p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> (hazard ratio 3.33, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.35, p = 0.003), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.41 to 6.19, p = 0.004), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 2.73, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.59, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A risk score was constructed using these predictors in which patients were assigned 1 point for the presence of each risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in the low-risk (no risk factor), moderate-risk (1 risk factor), and high-risk (&gt;1 risk factor) groups were 0.5%, 1.9%, and 6.5% per patient-year, respectively (log-rank p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in adult with CHD and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> specific clinical variables identify patients at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the absence of any of these risk factors is associated with an excellent survival despite the presence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
