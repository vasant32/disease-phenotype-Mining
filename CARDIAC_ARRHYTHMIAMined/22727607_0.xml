<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known or understood about the nature of complications that occur during a surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Definitions, classification, and documentation are substantive challenges to comprehensive event capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that our prospective complication database (ie, Surgical Activity Tracking System) would supplement traditional sources of intraoperative complication reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients undergoing surgery on a single general surgical service from June 2005 through May 2010 were selected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had been entered into the Surgical Activity Tracking System, a prospective complication database that identifies and captures complications in real time, using a specially trained nurse practitioner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative complications were grouped into 1 of 9 categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative reports and discharge summaries were analyzed by an independent reviewer to determine if the complication(s) had been documented by a traditional data source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight thousand eight hundred and ninety-six operations were performed on 7,729 patients during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-seven patients (1.5%) experienced an intraoperative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nonintestinal organ lacerations, inadvertent enterotomies, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were the most common adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The operative reports failed to mention 20 of the 151 complications (13%), and discharge summaries failed to report 22 complications (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some complications, such as inadvertent enterotomy, were almost always reported, but others such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, were only occasionally described (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective complication tracking system identified a considerable number of complications that were not available in either the operative report or discharge summary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of unreported adverse events varied greatly by category, suggesting opportunities for improvement in both complication identification and tracking </plain></SENT>
