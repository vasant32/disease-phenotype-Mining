<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cardiac electrical impulse depends on an orchestrated interplay of transmembrane ionic currents in myocardial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two critical ionic current mechanisms are the inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(K1)), which is important for maintenance of the cell resting membrane potential, and the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (I(Na)), which provides a rapid depolarizing current during the upstroke of the action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By controlling the resting membrane potential, I(K1) modifies <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel availability and therefore, cell excitability, action potential duration, and velocity of impulse propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, I(K1)-I(Na) interactions are key determinants of electrical rotor frequency responsible for abnormal, often lethal, cardiac reentrant activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used a multidisciplinary approach based on molecular and biochemical techniques, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> gene transfer or silencing, and electrophysiology to show that I(K1)-I(Na) interactions involve a reciprocal modulation of expression of their respective channel proteins (Kir2.1 and Na(V)1.5) within a macromolecular complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, an increase in functional expression of one channel reciprocally modulates the other to enhance cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modulation is model-independent; it is demonstrable in myocytes isolated from mouse and rat hearts and with transgenic and adenoviral-mediated overexpression/silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also show that the post synaptic density, discs large, and zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain protein SAP97 is a component of this macromolecular complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that the interplay between Na(v)1.5 and Kir2.1 has electrophysiological consequences on the myocardium and that SAP97 may affect the integrity of this complex or the nature of Na(v)1.5-Kir2.1 interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal modulation between Na(v)1.5 and Kir2.1 and the respective ionic currents should be important in the ability of the heart to undergo self-sustaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac rhythm disturbances</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
