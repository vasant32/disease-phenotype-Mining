<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective controlled cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Hospital in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: A total of 575 women with ICP and 1374 control women, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> having delivered in 1969-1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were sent to 544 ICP patients and 1235 control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responses were received from 1178 (66.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaire survey in autumn 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived health, symptoms and complaints, diseases diagnosed by a doctor and use of medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected in perceived health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in recent symptoms and complaints were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses made by a doctor showed higher frequencies in the ICP group than in control women for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and hypothyreosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and high cholesterol requiring medication as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> were less frequent in the ICP group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Women in this group used antacid medicines more often than control women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There were few differences between the ICP patients and control women except for a higher frequency of later <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatobiliary disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and hypothyreosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Women with a history of ICP should be screened for hypothyreosis more readily than those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> warrants further research </plain></SENT>
