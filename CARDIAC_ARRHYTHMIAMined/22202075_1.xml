<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase C (PKC) and several other kinases play a pivotal role in cardiac electrophysiological remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identifying specific therapies that regulate these kinases is the main focus of current research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PKC, a family of serine/threonine kinases, has been implicated as potential signaling nodes associated with biochemical and biophysical stress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the role of PKC isozymes that are involved in cardiac excitability and discuss both genetic and pharmacological tools that were used, their attributes and limitations </plain></SENT>
