<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic drugs are considered a trigger factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002271'>autonomic dysregulation</z:hpo>, which has been shown to predict potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the dose-dependent effect of antipsychotic drugs and other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> on autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) activity remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the dose-dependent effect of antipsychotic drugs and other clinical factors on ANS activity in an adequate sample size of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 211 Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and 44 healthy subjects participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANS activity was assessed by means of heart rate variability (HRV) power spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">Antipsychotic drug</z:chebi> treatment and various clinical factors were investigated for each participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient group was categorized into three subgroups according to daily dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotic drug</z:chebi>, and HRV was compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed significantly decreased low-frequency and high-frequency components of HRV in the patient group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high-dose group showed a significantly lower HRV than the medium-dose group and an even lower HRV than the low-dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a significant association between HRV and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotic drug</z:chebi> dose was identified by multiple regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HRV was not associated with age, sex, body mass index, duration of illness, or daily dose of other <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that antipsychotic drugs exert a significant dose-dependent effect on the extent of decline in ANS activity, and that optimal antipsychotic medication is required to avoid possible cardiovascular adverse events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
