<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to examine diastolic dysfunction as a risk for incident AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the association of echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function with the incidence of AF in 4480 participants enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study, an ongoing cohort of community-dwelling older adults from four US communities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent baseline echocardiography in 1989-1990 and were followed for incident AF on routine follow-up and hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 50 941 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up time 12.1 years), 1219 participants developed AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multivariable-adjusted age-stratified Cox models, diastolic echocardiographic parameters were significantly associated with the risk of incident AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant parameters were the Doppler peak E-wave velocity and left atrial diameter, which demonstrated a positive nonlinear association [HR 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) and HR 1.7 (CI 1.4-2.1) for highest vs. lowest quintile, respectively], and Doppler A-wave velocity time integral, which displayed a U-shaped relationship with the risk of AF [HR 0.7 (CI 0.6-0.9) for middle vs. lowest quintile] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each diastolic parameter displayed a significant association with adjusted NT-proBNP levels, although the nature of the association did not entirely parallel the risk of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further cluster analysis revealed unique patterns of diastolic function that may identify patients at risk for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a community-based population of older adults, echocardiographic measures of diastolic function are significantly associated with an increased risk of AF </plain></SENT>
