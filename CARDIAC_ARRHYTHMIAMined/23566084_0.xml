<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine risk factors for the presence of LQTS-related symptoms in a single pediatric center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were 146 consecutive LQTS patients (M:F= 72:74) who visited our hospital between April 2005 and August 2012 and during the preceding 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>103 subjects were discovered by the school-based screening, 15 subjects visited because of their symptoms, and the others were 28 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One subject died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for the presence of symptoms after diagnosis were longer QTc values (p=0.01), the presence of past history of LQTS-related symptoms (p=0.04), and longer follow-up periods (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noncompliance with medicine was the sole risk factor for frequent symptoms after diagnosis (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In subjects discovered by the school-based screening, 9 subjects (9%) had LQTS-related symptoms after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up periods was the sole risk for the presence of symptoms (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean period until the presence of symptoms after diagnosis was 3.1 Â± 2.7 year (0.1-7.1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Good compliance with medicine is essential to prevent recurrent episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A new strategy is required to keep on following-up subjects for long time though subjects discovered by the school-based screening </plain></SENT>
