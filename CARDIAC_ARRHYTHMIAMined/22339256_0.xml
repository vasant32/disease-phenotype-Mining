<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the development of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors that block fibrinogen binding to the receptor has become an attractive strategy for antiplatelet therapy with an expected strong and specific effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presently, there are three commercially available GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors: abciximab, eptifibatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three drugs are commonly administered intravenously, and large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated a clear clinical benefit and good safety profile in patients at high risk, especially those undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, several studies tested the intracoronary (IC) route for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in order to verify its safety and its possible superiority as compared to the intravenous (IV) route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the studies testing the IC route were conducted using abciximab and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> with better results in terms of myocardial reperfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and also promising results in terms of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the IC administration of eptifibatide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> only some, even if promising, data are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Larger and randomized studies are warranted to confirm the superiority of the IC route of administration of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to the IV one in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> undergoing PCI </plain></SENT>
