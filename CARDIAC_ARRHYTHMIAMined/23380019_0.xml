<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> carry a high burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and may pose special challenges when these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are addressed invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to describe our early experience with radiofrequency (RF) needle transseptal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> to facilitate ablation procedures in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of attempted transseptal access with a commercial RF needle at Children's Hospital Boston between February 2007 and January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10 patients had attempted RF transseptal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 27 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had undergone atrial switch procedures (Mustard/Senning), four had undergone Fontan operations, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indication for left atrial access was mapping/ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in nine cases, and left-sided accessory pathway in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RF needle was chosen primarily in eight of 10 cases, whereas in the remaining two cases RF was used only after failed attempts with a conventional Brockenbrough needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Septal material was atrial muscle in five cases, pericardium in three, and synthetic fabric in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In nine of 10 patients, RF transseptal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was successful, including both patients in whom a conventional needle had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no clinically significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RF transseptal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> can be an effective method of obtaining left atrial access for electrophysiologic procedures in patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, including cases where a conventional Brockenbrough needle has failed </plain></SENT>
