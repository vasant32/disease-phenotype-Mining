<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events between patients transplanted for NASH and alcohol (ETOH)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective cohort study (August 1993 to March 2010) of 242 patients (115 NASH and 127 ETOH) with â‰¥12 months follow-up after liver transplantation (LT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> or coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier's and Cox's proportional hazard analyses were conducted to compare survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to calculate the likelihood of CV events, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cardiac cause, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> requiring hospitalization &lt;1 year after LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the NASH group were older (58.4 versus 53.3 years) and were more likely to be female (45% versus 18%; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were more likely to be morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (32% versus 9%), have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (25% versus 6%), or have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (53% versus 38%; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, NASH patients were more likely to have a CV event &lt;1 year after LT, compared to ETOH patients, even after controlling for recipient age, sex, smoking status, pretransplant <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, CV disease, and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (26% versus 8%; odds ratio = 4.12; 95% confidence interval = 1.91-8.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority (70%) of events occurred in the perioperative period, and the occurrence of a CV event was associated with a 50% overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there were no differences in patient, graft, or CV mortality between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CV complications are common after LT, and NASH patients are at increased risk independent of traditional cardiac risk factors, though this did not affect overall mortality </plain></SENT>
