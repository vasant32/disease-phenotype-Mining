<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether experimentally-induced endotoxaemia induced elevations in plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in horses and how this might affect the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight Standardbred horses received an intravenous continuous rate infusion of endotoxin (total dose 500 ng/kg) for 6 h while being monitored using electrocardiography (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected before the start of the endotoxin infusion, every 60 min during the infusion, then 1, 2, 3, 8, 10 and 24 h post-infusion, and analysed for cTnI concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One horse was excluded from the study owing to a high initial cTnI concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endotoxin infusion induced an increase in cTnI concentrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> horses, reaching mean peak concentration of 0.135±0.094 μg/L by 1 h post-infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cTnI concentrations then decreased and were no longer significantly different from pre-infusion concentrations at 6, 10 and 24 h post-infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of ventricular events was generally low during the infusion period, but increased during the first 3 h post-infusion in 6/7 horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevated cTnI concentrations could be detected early after an endotoxaemic insult using an ultrasensitive cTnI assay, with peak cTnI concentrations preceding the occurrence of ventricular events on ECG </plain></SENT>
