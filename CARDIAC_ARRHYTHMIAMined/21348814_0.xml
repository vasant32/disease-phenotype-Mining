<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 1.258 consecutive patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular Fibrillation</z:hpo>, sustained and nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular Tachycardia</z:hpo> were considered as HRVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association between admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, in-hospital mortality and HRVT was assessed with Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of in-hospital HRVT was 20% (254/1258 patients) and in-hospital mortality (115/1.258) was higher in patients with HRVT (20% vs 6%) (p&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes Mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) was present in 441 patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Optimal threshold level of glycemia admission to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 180 mg/dl (AUC = 0.716; 0.66- 0.76)(p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with euglycemia on admission (&lt; 120 mg/dL) had lowest prevalence of HRVT (13%)(OR=0.6;0.46-0.78) in contrast to non DM patients who presented <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 180 mg/dL that exhibited 2-fold increase of in-hospital HRVT (36%; OR=2.2; 1.6-3)(p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate risk adjusted hazard ratio (HR) analysis showed that, blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg (HR=2.4; 1.6-3.6)(p&lt;0.001), White Blood Count (WBC)&gt;10.000 cell count (HR=1.44;1.02-2)(p=0.04) and admission glycemia 180 mg/dL (HR=1.5; 1.04-2.3)( p=0.03) had a significantly increased risk in in-hospital HRTV only in NDM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher glycemia on admission the higher prevalence of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and mortality regardless <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status in patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated initial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level and WBC count considered along with other clinical data can assist in life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in non diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
