<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the EW and the electrical activation has been established in prior studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the methods used previously to map the EW required the reconstruction of images over multiple cardiac cycles, precluding the application of EWI for non-periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, new imaging sequences are developed and applied based on flash- and wide-beam emissions to image the entire heart at very high frame rates (2000 fps) during free breathing in a single heartbeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The methods are first validated by imaging the heart of an open-chest canine while simultaneously mapping the electrical activation using a 64-electrode basket catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Feasibility is then assessed by imaging the atria and ventricles of closed-chest, conscious canines during sinus rhythm and during right-ventricular pacing following atrio-ventricular dissociation, i.e., during a non-periodic rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EW was validated against electrode measurements in the open-chest case, and followed the expected electrical propagation pattern in the closed-chest setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that EWI can be used for the characterization of non-periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in conditions similar to the clinical setting, in a single heartbeat, and during free breathing </plain></SENT>
