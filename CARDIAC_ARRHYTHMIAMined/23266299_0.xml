<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Frequency and severity of cardiac involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of our study were to determine the frequency and progression of cardiac and muscle involvement in a relatively large cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> throughout Italy and Germany and to provide long-term outcomes in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 104 DM2 and 117 DM1 patients underwent baseline and follow-up assessments of, ECG, 24h Holter monitoring, 2D echocardiography and electrophysiological study (EPS) when appropriate, and manual muscle strength testing (mean follow-up: 7.4±4.1 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> and 5.7±4years for DM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 10% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients vs 31% of DM1 patients had PR≥200ms and 17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients vs 48% of DM1 patients had QRSD≥100ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> vs 28 patients with DM1 required PM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients were stronger than DM1 patients at baseline, but muscle strength worsened significantly over time (p&lt;0.0001), just as in DM1, although at a slower annual rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the frequency and severity of cardiac involvement and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> are reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> compared to DM1 and that progression is slower and less severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, careful cardiac evaluation is recommended in this patient population to identify patients at risk for potential major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
