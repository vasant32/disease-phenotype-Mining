<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence strongly implicates hereditary determinants in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and the genetic defects responsible for AF in the majority of cases remain to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the coding exons and splice junctions of GATA4, a gene encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor critical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac morphogenesis, were sequenced in a cohort of 150 unrelated patients with idiopathic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the mutation carriers and a total of 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped for the presence of mutations identified in index patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of the mutant GATA4 was characterized using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, two novel heterozygous GATA4 mutations (p.Y38D and p.P103A) were identified in 2 unrelated families with AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each family the mutation co-segregated with AF and was absent in the 400 control chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis showed that the mutations of GATA4 were associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings expand the mutation spectrum of GATA4 linked to AF, and further support the notion that compromised GATA4 confers genetic susceptibility to AF </plain></SENT>
