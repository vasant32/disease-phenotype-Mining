<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Wenxin Keli is a popular Chinese herb extract that approximately five million Asians are currently taking for the treatment of a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its electrophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The concentration-dependent electrophysiological effects of Wenxin Keli were evaluated in the isolated rabbit left ventricular myocytes and wedge preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli selectively inhibited late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (I(Na) ) with an IC(50) of 3.8 ± 0.4 mg/mL, which was significantly lower than the IC(50) of 10.6 ± 0.9 mg/mL (n = 6, P &lt; 0.05) for the fast I(Na)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli produced a small but statistically significant QT prolongation at 0.3 mg/mL, but shortened the QT and T(p-e) interval at concentrations ≥1 mg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wenxin Keli increased QRS duration by 10.1% from 34.8 ± 1.0 ms to 38.3 ± 1.1 ms (n = 6, P &lt; 0.01) at 3 mg/mL at a basic cycle length of 2,000 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, its effect on the QRS duration exhibited weak use-dependency, that is, QRS remained less changed at increased pacing rates than other classic <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blockers, such as flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Wenxin Keli at 1-3 mg/mL markedly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-induced QT and T(p-e) prolongation by attenuation of its reverse use-dependence and abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-induced early afterdepolarization (EAD) in four of four left ventricular wedge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also suppressed digoxin-induced delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> without changing the positive staircase pattern in contractility at 1-3 mg/mL in a separate experimental series (four of four) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Wenxin Keli suppressed EADs, DADs, and triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> via selective inhibition of late I(Na)  </plain></SENT>
