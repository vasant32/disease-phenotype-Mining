<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to assess the influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation rates of anatomic characteristics of the ostium, increasing experience of four different operators, and additional use of a steerable sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the first 190 patients (pts) undergoing PVAC ablation, minimum/maximum diameter, area and shape of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia, and the length of a common ostium were analysed from computed tomography 3D reconstructions of the left atrium and related to isolation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a comparison was drawn between pts at the beginning and after completion (isolation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in â‰¥ 85% of pts) of the learning curve, and the effect of a steerable sheath was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved with the PVAC alone in 85% of pts and in 94% of veins after a median procedure and ablation time of 154 [interquartile ranges (IQR): 120, 200] and 51 (IQR: 38, 70) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in isolation rates was observed after the first 60 pts (73 vs. 90% of pts; P&lt; 0.01; 88 vs. 96% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>; P&lt; 0.001), coincident with routine use of a steerable sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anatomic characteristics (larger minimum diameter and area) identified unsuccessful isolation only of the left inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> at the beginning of the learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein isolation rates using this catheter are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anatomic variability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia modestly affects <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Standard use of a steerable sheath plays a major role in increasing isolation rates and overcoming 'difficult' <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomies</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
