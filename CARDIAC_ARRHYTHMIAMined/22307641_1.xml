<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the Ca(2+) signals produced by the opening of these channels is a hallmark of many intracellular signaling cascades, including excitation-contraction coupling in heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using optogenetic approaches, we discovered that Ca(v)1.2 channels form clusters of varied sizes in ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physical interaction between these channels via their C-tails renders them capable of coordinating their gating, thereby amplifying Ca(2+) influx and excitation-contraction coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light-induced fusion of WT Ca(v)1.2 channels with Ca(v)1.2 channels carrying a gain-of-function mutation that causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> in humans with Timothy syndrome (Ca(v)1.2-TS) increased Ca(2+) currents, diastolic and systolic Ca(2+) levels, contractility and the frequency of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) fluctuations in ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that these changes in Ca(2+) signaling resulted from Ca(v)1.2-TS increasing the activity of adjoining WT Ca(v)1.2 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data support the concept that oligomerization of Ca(v)1.2 channels via their C termini can result in the amplification of Ca(2+) influx into excitable cells </plain></SENT>
