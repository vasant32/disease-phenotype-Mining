<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we propose a new method utilizing a novel near-infrared voltage-sensitive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> DI-4-ANBDQBS to determine the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of the sources of such depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the method in live preparations of pig left and right ventricular myocardium (thickness 8-18 mm) and phantoms imitating the optical properties of myocardial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method utilizes an alternating transillumination approach that involves comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded broad-field epifluorescence and transillumination images produced at two alternating directions of illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recordings were taken simultaneously by two CCD cameras facing the endocardial and epicardial surfaces of the heart at a frame rate up to 3 KHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In live preparations, we were able to localize the origin of the depolarization wave with a precision of Â±1.3mm in the transmural direction and 3 mm in the image plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of detection was independent of the depth of the source inside ventricular wall </plain></SENT>
