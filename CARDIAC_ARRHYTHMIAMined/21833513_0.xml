<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quadripolar Quartet model 1458Q (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) left ventricular lead (LV) has four electrodes (one distal tip and three ring) capable of ten different pacing vectors which may allow reprogramming to eliminate PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients underwent attempted CRT-D implantation between October 2009 and October 2010 with the Quartet lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pacing parameters, lead position, complications and presence of PNS were collected at implant, pre-discharge and at 3 and 6 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A quadripolar LV lead was successfully implanted in 95% (38/40) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, one patient (3%) had a lead displacement requiring reposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LV pacing parameters remained stable at 6 months follow-up (mean threshold 1.3 V at 0.6 ms and impedance 948 Ω) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PNS at the time of implant was observed in 12 patients (32%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were overcome by using the additional vectors available on the quadripolar LV lead or by repositioning the lead at the time of index implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 6 months follow-up there were five (13%) cases of PNS, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were successfully treated by reprogramming to a different vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No cases required reintervention, surgical epicardial lead placement, or that lead be turned off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The quadripolar Quartet lead is associated with a high implant success rate, stable pacing parameters and a low displacement rate during the first 6 months after implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ten LV pacing vectors available with this lead allowed PNS and capture threshold problems to be overcome at implant, and importantly at follow-up, thus obviating the need for lead reposition </plain></SENT>
