<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the international literature.The impact of AF in terms of cost is not negligible and it is therefore desirable to implement an organizational scheme that safeguards the appropriateness of care, taking charge of the patient as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of early diagnosis of AF are to improve the appropriateness of care and optimize the use of specialized tests, thereby reducing hospital admissions for complications or recurrences of AF </plain></SENT>
