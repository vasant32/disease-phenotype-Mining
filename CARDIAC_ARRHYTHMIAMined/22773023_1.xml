<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We describe a novel fluoroscopy coregistered, 4-dimensional catheter tracking technology (MediGuide Technology [MGT]) used for treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate (1) the feasibility of nonfluoroscopic catheter manipulation within dynamic left atrial chamber models; (2) the integration of the technology into an established electroanatomical mapping system; and (3) potential clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-nine patients received <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation using MGT-enabled NavX-EnSite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matched patients ablated with a conventional NavX-EnSite system served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MGT was used for the deployment of diagnostic catheters within preacquired cine loops, for nonfluoroscopic chamber mapping within dynamic angiograms, and for 4-dimensional tagging of anatomical landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Integration with the electroanatomical mapping system allowed correction of field distortions and a reference tool to detect and correct map shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation was done without MGT because the ablation catheter was not MGT enabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MGT worked safely and stably in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catheter deployment within the preacquired cine loops was successfully performed in 45 of 49 (92%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Catheter tracking within dynamic left atrial angiograms allowed nearly nonfluoroscopic creation of NavX-EnSite geometries with subsequent computed tomography model registration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, MGT significantly reduced total procedural fluoroscopy time (median [quartiles]) from 31 minutes (25, 43 minutes) to 16 minutes (10, 23 minutes) and irradiation dose from 14 453±7403 to 7363±5827 cGy*cm(2) (mean±SD), respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MGT is a tracking technology that allows 4-dimensional visualization of dedicated catheters within moving chamber models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Integration of the MGT with an established electroanatomical mapping system provided algorithms to facilitate mapping in the electroanatomical mapping system environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As a first measurable clinical impact, MGT was able to reduce fluoroscopy exposure by nearly 50% </plain></SENT>
