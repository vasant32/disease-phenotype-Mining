<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In some pathological conditions <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> concentration is high while in others it is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases,<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> can occur and lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, acylcarnitine (acyl-CAR), but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi>, is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through modulation of ionic currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of acyl-CARs on hERG, K(IR)2.1 and K(v)7.1/minK channels (channels responsible for I(KR), I(K1) and I(KS) respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HEK293 cells stably expressing hERG, K(IR)2.1 or Kv7.1/minK were studied using the patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Free <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> (CAR) and acyl-CAR derivatives from medium- (C8 and C10) and long-chain (C16 and C18:1) fatty acids were applied intra- and extracellularly at different concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For studies on hERG, C16 and C18:1 free fatty acid were also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Extracellular long-chain (LCAC), but not medium-chain, acyl-CAR,induced an increase of I(hERG) amplitude associated with a dose-dependent speeding of deactivation kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They had no effect on K(IR)2.1 or Kv7.1/minK currents.Computer simulations of these effects were consistent with changes in action potential profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND APPLICATIONS: Extracellular LCAC tonically regulates I(hERG) amplitude and kinetics under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This modulation may contribute to the changes in action potential duration that precede <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and primary systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
