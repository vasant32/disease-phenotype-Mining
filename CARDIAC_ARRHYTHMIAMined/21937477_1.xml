<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, catheter-based ablative approaches are mainly reserved for drug-refractory patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the value of an ablative therapy as a first-line alternative remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to analyse the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural success and clinical outcome of patients with lone paroxysmal AF undergoing cryoballoon ablation (CBA) as first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen individuals (mean age 44 ± 9 years, range 23-61 years, 15 males) with lone paroxysmal AF preferring a catheter-based treatment to drug treatment as first-line therapy were consecutively enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean left atrial size was 39 ± 4 mm and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 58 ± 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a mean of 2.4 CBA (range 2-4) applications pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation could be demonstrated in 70 (97%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional lesions with a focal ablation catheter were needed to isolate one right inferior pulmonary vein and one left superior pulmonary vein in two different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (100%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a 2-month blanking period, 16 patients (89%) were free of symptomatic AF recurrence at a mean follow-up of 14 ± 9 months and without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation in patients with lone paroxysmal AF yields a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> efficacy rate with a great chance of being free of symptomatic AF recurrence without antiarrhythmic drugs on a mid-term follow-up period, when offered as a first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
