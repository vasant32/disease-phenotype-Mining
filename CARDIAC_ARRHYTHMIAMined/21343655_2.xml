<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> involves various serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that sometimes have lethal consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the electrocardiogram findings, arrhythmogenicity and abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system in children with fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2008, 7 consecutive patients (mean age: 7 years) who suffered from fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 12-lead electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring and signal-averaged electrocardiograms were performed and compared between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, convalescent, and recovery phases in the 4 surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, electrophysiologic assessment was carried out during the convalescent phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five out of 7 patients developed complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, 3 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, 2 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, 1 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, 1 had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, and 1 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the surviving patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> resolved during the convalescent and remote phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No atrial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced in any patients during the programmed stimulation study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the convalescent phase, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> could be induced and there were no signs of any conduction abnormalities on electrophysiological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Close follow-up should be performed to observe for the occurrence of any new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and/or a decrease in cardiac function in children with fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
