<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is little recent information regarding outcome and its determinants following cardioversion (CV) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) or flutter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to help improve prediction of cardiac rhythm outcome following CV for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cardiac rhythm at 6 weeks and 12 months was documented following elective (EC; n=496) or immediate (IC; n=52) cardioversion for AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in a single referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 65 and 58% of IC patients remained in sinus rhythm (SR) 6 weeks and 1 year after CV (respectively) compared with 43% and 30% in EC patients (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent positive predictors of SR 6 weeks after cardioversion included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy (OR 2.04 [1.28-3.33], P&lt;0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (OR 1.85 [1.09-3.13], P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Negative predictors included the need for &gt;1 shock to achieve SR (OR 1.61 [1.12-2.37], P=0.011) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> duration, (OR 0.96 [0.95-0.97], P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and the need for &gt;1 shock remained independent predictors of rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of shocks required to achieve SR is a newly demonstrated independent predictor of rhythm outcome after elective CV </plain></SENT>
