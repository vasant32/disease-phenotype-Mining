<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Up to 2008, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> that was the most recommended in our intensive care unit (ICU) after fluid resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recently, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> has become the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> that was most recommended in our ICU after fluid resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine if there was an efficacy or safety benefit to this protocol therapeutic change in patients with shock admitted to our ICU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome variable was ICU mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is a prospective observational study conducted in 2 periods in our ICU (Habib Bourguiba University Hospital, Sfax, Tunisia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 2 study periods, 251 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 130 patients in group 1 and 121 patients in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to most of the baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The comparison between the 2 groups showed that in the first period, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> that was the most used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the second period, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> that was most used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> prescription in septic shock, we concluded that in the first study period, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was used as the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> as the first choice in 85.7% of cases (P &lt; 0.001), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is the first choice in 100% of cases in the second period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cardiogenic shock, in the first study period, dobutamine was used as the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> as the first choice in 61% of cases (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is the first choice in 43% of cases in the second period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, in hypovolemic shock, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was used as the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> as the first choice in 68% of cases in group 1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> is the first choice in 88% of cases in the second period (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During the ICU stay, some adverse events related to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> use were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was at 51% in the first group and 44% in the second group (P = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was not significantly different for each type of shock (septic, cardiogenic, and hypovolemic) in both groups (P &gt; 0.05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), although the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in the first group, in clinical practice, our study confirms that the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> did not differ significantly between the 2 groups of patients mostly treated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (group 1) and the group mostly treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
