<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AF is expected to rise with the aging population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to characterize the Québec AF patient population at the time of diagnosis of AF, quantify medical resource use prior to and after the initial diagnosis of AF, and determine overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Québec databases to evaluate patients diagnosed with AF between January 1, 1998, and April 30, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 64,157 patients were included in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of diagnosis of AF, patients also suffered from several diseases, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (15.8%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> (15.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the year prior to AF diagnosis, in the year after AF diagnosis patients were more frequently hospitalized (1.5 vs 1.1 hospitalizations) and for longer periods (5.6 vs 3.3 days), and had more outpatient visits (12.9 vs 11.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival rapidly decreased during the first 60 days (60-day mortality, 6.1%) and steadily declined thereafter, with mortality rates of 14.7% and 36.8% at 1 and 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: At the time of diagnosis of AF, patients often suffer from several comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of AF is associated with an increase in medical resource use and higher mortality rates, particularly within the first 60 days </plain></SENT>
