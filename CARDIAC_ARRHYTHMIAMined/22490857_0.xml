<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the value of cardiopulmonary exercise test and conventional pulmonary function tests in the prediction of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in high risk patients with chest <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2006 to January 2009, 216 consecutive patients with thoracic <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> underwent conventional pulmonary function tests (PFT, spirometry + DLCOsb for diffusion capacity) and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The correlation of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications with the parameters of PFT and CPET were retrospectively analyzed using Chi-square test, independent sample t-test and logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 216 patients, 57 did not receive operation due to advanced stage diseases or poor cardiopulmonary function in most of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 159 underwent different modes of operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients (22.6%) in this operated group had postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and 10 patients (6.3%) developed operation-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients (1.9%) died of the complications within 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were stratified into groups based on V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max/pred (≥ 65.0%, &lt; 65.0%); V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max×kg(-1)×min(-1) (≥ 20 ml, 15 - 19.9 ml, &lt; 15 ml) and FEV1 (≥ 2.0 L, 1.2 - 1.99 L, &lt; 1.2 L) according to the criteria in reported papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant difference among these groups in the parameters (P &lt; 0.05), the rates of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications were much higher in the groups with poor cardiopulmonary function (V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max/pred &lt; 65.0%; V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max×kg(-1)×min(-1) &lt; 15 ml or FEV1 &lt; 1.2 L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was shown by logistic regression analysis that postoperative cardiopulmonary complications were significantly correlated with age, associated diseases, poor results of PFT or CPET, operation modes and operation-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FEV1 in spirometry, V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max×kg(-1)×min(-1) and V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max/pred in cardiopulmonary exercise test can be used to stratify the patients' cardiopulmonary function status and is correlated well with FEV1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>V(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) max×kg(-1)×min(-1) is the best parameter among these three parameters to predict the risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in patients with chest <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> and borderline cardiopulmonary function </plain></SENT>
