<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:  Congenital left <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysm</z:hpo> (LVA) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> (LVD) are rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo> frequently associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:  A total of 108 patients with LVA or LVD having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG-abnormalities</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into 2 groups according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>: a distinct ECG group (8 ECG patterns known to be frequently associated with LVA/LVD); and a control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, rhythm disturbances, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, embolic events, and hospitalization for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 64±10 years; 45 (42%) were male; median follow-up (FU) was 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint occurred in 12/27 patients from the distinct ECG group and in 15/81 patients in the control group (44% vs. 19%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac event rate per year (CER) was 1.8% vs. 0.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and embolic events) at time of diagnosis increased the incidence of adverse events during FU (70% vs. 28%; P=0.05; CER 2.9% vs. 1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age ≥64 years, presence of LVD, gender, and location of the anomaly did not affect the incidence of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:  The incidence of adverse events in symptomatic patients with isolated LVA or LVD and distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> patterns is increased during long-term FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the present patients, however, experienced cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>.  </plain></SENT>
