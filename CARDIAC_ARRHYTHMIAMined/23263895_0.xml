<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (PCVA) during electrophysiologic (EP) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> is one of the most feared complications during EP procedures with very few data regarding its characteristics, management, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1998 and December 2008, we reviewed 30,032 invasive EP procedures for PCVA occurrence and characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management and outcomes were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-eight <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (53 %) were intraprocedural and 18 (47 %) postprocedural </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two (84 %) were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and six (16 %) as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> except one (37, 97 %) were ischemic and the vast majority occurred during ablation procedures (36, 95 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 11 (35 %) were treated with reperfusion (eight catheter-based therapy and three intravenous t-PA) of whom five (46 %) had complete recovery, three (27 %) had partial recovery, and three (27 %) had no recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No hemorrhagic transformations occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> during EP procedures is rare and is almost always ischemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It occurs more frequently during ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion therapy is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
