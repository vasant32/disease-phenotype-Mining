<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to develop The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) mortality risk models for multiple valve procedures, which comprise 12% of total valve operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database for 50,231 patients undergoing combinations of aortic (A), mitral (M), and tricuspid (T) surgery between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2010, divided into developmental (2004 to 2009) and validation (2010) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary valve operations, aortic root replacements, and dissection procedures were excluded, and insufficient AT procedures were available to model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using stepwise logistic regression, the risk of operative mortality was estimated for each valve surgery type: AM, n = 27,035; MT, n = 18,686; and AMT, n = 4,510 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two separate models were estimated, one that included only patient characteristics and status at presentation, and thereby would be suitable for performance profiling; and another that added discretionary operative variables such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation or valve repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unadjusted operative mortality was 7.6% for MT, 9.4% for AM, and 13.1% for AMT procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors for mortality included emergency presentation, advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, reoperation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006528'>chronic lung disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and female sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In models containing intraoperative variables, performance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation and atrioventricular valve repair were protective for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the validation sample, the model exhibited acceptable discrimination in each of the three procedural subgroups (C = 0.711 to 0.727) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk models were developed to predict operative mortality for patients having multiple valve procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These models may be useful for outcome assessment, quality improvement, patient counseling, shared decision making, and research </plain></SENT>
