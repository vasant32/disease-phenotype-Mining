<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current therapeutic options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are limited to afterload reducers and positive inotropes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The latter increases myocardial contractility through changes in myocyte calcium (Ca(2+)) handling (mostly through stimulation of the β-adrenergic pathways [β-ADR]) and is associated with paradoxical effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and subsequently increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that probenecid can increase cytosolic Ca(2+) levels in the cardiomyocyte resulting in an improved inotropic response in vitro and in vivo without activating the β-ADR system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that, in contrast to other commonly used inotropes, probenecid functions through a system separate from that of β-ADR and hence will increase contractility and improve function without damaging the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our goal was to evaluate the effect of probenecid on cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro and its use in vivo as a positive inotrope in a mouse model of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, we demonstrate that probenecid induced an influx of Ca(2+) similar to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, but does not induce cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Through a series of in vivo experiments we also demonstrate that probenecid can be used at various time points and with various methods of administration in vivo in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, resulting in improved contractility and no significant difference in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide novel data that probenecid, through its activity on cellular Ca(2+) levels, induces an inotropic effect without causing or exacerbating injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This discovery may be translatable if this mechanism is preserved in man </plain></SENT>
