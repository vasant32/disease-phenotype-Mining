<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, poor solubility of this compound has limited its intravenous application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAR11464A is a water-soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-like drug that lacks <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> and inhibits multiple cardiac ion channels in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the antiarrhythmic efficacy of this drug in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In porcine studies, atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anesthetized thoracotomized pigs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was induced by a premature beat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) was induced via either burst pacing or programmed electrical stimulation (a series of progressively shorter beats, S1-S5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In canine studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was induced by a 2-min occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery during the last minute of exercise in dogs with healed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One week later, this test was repeated after pretreatment with SAR114646A (3.0 mg/kg, i.v., slow bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SAR114646A produced a significant dose-dependent prolongation of AERP, inhibited AF induced by a premature stimulus, and electrically induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in anesthetized pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, i.v., it was superior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, and flecainide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In dogs, SAR114646A did not alter any ECG parameter including QTc (control, 236.9 ± 8.5 ms vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>, 237.2 ± 3.5 ms) but significantly reduced the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, protecting six of eight animals (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SAR114646A was effective against both atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> without altering ventricular repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-like drug SAR114646A may be an effective antiarrhythmic intervention that does not adversely prolong ventricular repolarization </plain></SENT>
