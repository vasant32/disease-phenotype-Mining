<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two extracts of S. miltiorrhiza (extract 1: <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> : water - 50 : 50; extract 2: 96% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experiments were performed after 7 consecutive days of administration of the extracts (200 mg/kg b.w., intragastrically) to male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, after placing animals for 60 min in the controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (500 mm Hg) the systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) in conscious rats, bioelectric heart activity in unconscious rats and analysis of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters in the blood of rats: malonyldialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidase (LPO) concentration, activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPX) were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found out that the extract 1 augmented the lowering of SAP shown in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> affected control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary the extract 2 reversed SAP to values obtained in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both extracts led to the normalization of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, LPO and SOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems that the above-mentioned effects are coupled with different active compounds content in the extracts, however more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
