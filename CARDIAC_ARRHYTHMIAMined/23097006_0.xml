<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using phased radiofrequency (RF) energy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterize pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) conduction at repeat ablation in patients with AF after an initial successful PVI using phased RF technology and analyze the effects of a primary 2:1 ablation mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A primary 4:1 bipolar/unipolar mode in group A patients (n = 22) was compared with a primary 2:1 mode in group B (n = 22) acutely and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, 81 % showed reconnection(s); 52 % of them had reconnected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVI was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure and fluoroscopy times were shorter in group B (108 ± 15 vs. 126 ± 24 min and 17 �� 5 vs. 23 ± 7 min, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to a significant decrease of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnections within the first 30 min in 17 % of group B patients vs. 45 % of group A patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 9.5 ± 4 months, recurrence of AF was detected in 5 of 22 patients (22.7 %) in group A vs. 3 of 22 patients (13.6 %) in group B (p = 0.722) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phased RF energy applied by a 2:1 bipolar/unipolar mode seems safe and effective in redo-PVI procedures, resulting in a mid-term freedom from AF in 86.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times compared with a primary 4:1 ablation mode during repeat PVI are mainly attributed to a lower incidence of acutely reconnected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> within the first 30 min </plain></SENT>
