<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Objective: To determine whether an aerosolized β2-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> would improve clinical outcomes in patients with ALI.Design: Multi-center, phase III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Setting: 33 hospitals participating National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>Respiratory Distress</z:hpo> Syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>) Clinical Trials Network.Subjects: Patients who were intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, had bilateral infiltrates consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on frontal chest radiograph, had a ratio of PaO2 to FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 300 or less, and not had clinical evidence of left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A maximum enrolment of 1,000 patients was planned.Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive aerosolized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> (5 mg) or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days.Outcomes: The primary outcome variable was ventilator-free days (VFD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome measures included mortality before hospital discharge on day 60 and day 90, the number of intensive care unit (ICU)-free days and the number of organ failure-free days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 282 patients enrolled before the trial was stopped for futility after the second interim analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VFDs difference with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> treatment was unfavourable by -2.2 days, well past the futility boundary of -0.4 VFDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VFDs were not significantly different between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> and placebo groups (means of 14.4 and 16.6 days, respectively; 95% confidence interval for the difference, -4.7 to 0.3 days; P = 0.087) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> before hospital discharge and the number of organ failure-free days were also not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number of ICU-free days was lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> group in comparison with the placebo group (means of 13.5 and 16.2 days respectively; 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference, -4.9 to -0.4 days; P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, heart rates were significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> group by approximately 5 beats/minute in the first 2 days after randomization (P &lt; 0.05), but rates of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (10% in both groups) and other cardiac dysrhythmias were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that aerosolized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2549">albuterol</z:chebi> does not improve clinical outcomes in ALI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Routine use of β2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated ALI patients cannot be recommended </plain></SENT>
