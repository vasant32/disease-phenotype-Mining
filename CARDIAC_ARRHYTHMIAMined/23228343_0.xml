<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 27 isolated rabbit heart preparations studied under the action of drugs (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and KB-R7943) or physical procedures (stretching) that produce different degrees of change in the complexity of myocardial activation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, use was made of spectral, morphological, and mapping techniques to process the recordings obtained with epicardial multielectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complexity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> assessed by mapping techniques was related to the dominant frequency, normalized spectral energy, signal regularity index, and their corresponding coefficients of variation, as well as the area of the regions of interest identified on the basis of these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, we used as independent variables the area of the regions of interest related to the spectral energy and the coefficient of variation of the energy (complexity index=-0.005×area of the spectral energy regions -2.234×coefficient of variation of the energy+1.578; P=.0001; r=0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The spectral and morphological indicators and, independently, those derived from the analysis of normalized energy regions of interest provide a reliable approach to the evaluation of the complexity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> as an alternative to complex mapping techniques </plain></SENT>
