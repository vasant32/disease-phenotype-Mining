<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: LAI (90-minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) was obtained in isolated sheep hearts by selectively perfusing microspheres into the left anterior atrial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two CCD cameras and several bipolar electrodes enabled recording from multiple atrial locations: with a dual-camera set-up (Protocol 1, n=10; and 1', n=4; for bi-atrial or atrio-ventricular camera set-ups respectively), in the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (1µM) added to the perfusate after LAI (protocol 2, n=3) and after a pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> 10 µM (protocol 3, n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous AF occurred in 41.2% (7/17) of the hearts that were in sinus rhythm before LAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LAI caused APD shortening in both the ischemic (IZ) and non-ischemic (NIZ) zones by 21±8 and 34±13%, respectively (pacing, 5Hz, p&lt;0.05 compared to baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apparent impulse velocity was significantly reduced in the IZ but not in the NIZ (-65±19% and +9±18%, p=0.001 and n.s, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During LAI-related AF, a significant NIZ maximal dominant frequency (DFmax) increase from 7.4±2.5 to 14.0±5.5 Hz; p&lt;0.05, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi>, an IKATP channel blocker, averted LAI-related DFmax increase (NIZ: LAI vs Gli, 14.0±5.5 vs. 5.9±1.3 Hz, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interplay between spontaneous focal discharges and rotors, locating at the IZ-NIZ border zone, maintained LAI-related AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAI leads to an IKATP conductance-dependent APD shortening and spontaneous AF maintained by both spontaneous focal discharges and reentrant circuits locating at the IZ border zone </plain></SENT>
