<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">Carvedilol</z:chebi> and its analogues suppress delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> by direct action on the cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor type 2 (RyR2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test a hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> analogue may also prevent triggered activities (TAs) through the suppression of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracellular Ca(2+) and membrane voltage were simultaneously recorded by using optical mapping technique in Langendorff-perfused mouse and rabbit hearts to study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> analogue VK-II-36, which does not have significant beta-blocking effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous intracellular Ca(2+) elevations (SCaEs) during diastole were induced by rapid ventricular pacing and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion in intact rabbit ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic SCaEs were simultaneously noted in Langendorff-perfused RyR2 R4496(+/-) mouse hearts after creating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VK-II-36 effectively suppressed SCaEs and eliminated TAs observed in both mouse and rabbit ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We tested the effect of VK-II-36 on EADs by using a rabbit model of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>, in which phase 2 and phase 3 EADs were observed in association with systolic SCaEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VK-II-36 abolished the systolic SCaEs and phase 2 EADs, and greatly decreased the dispersion of repolarization and the amplitude of phase 3 EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VK-II-36 completely prevented EAD-mediated TAs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ventricles studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> analogue, VK-II-36, inhibits ventricular tachyarrhythmias in intact mouse and rabbit ventricles by the suppression of SCaEs, independent of beta-blocking activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The RyR2 may be a potential target for treating focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> triggered by either EADs or DADs </plain></SENT>
