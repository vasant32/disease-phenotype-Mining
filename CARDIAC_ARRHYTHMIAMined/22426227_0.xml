<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbation of Na(V)1.5 inactivation by drugs or inherited mutation can underlie and trigger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The carboxy terminus has an important role in channel inactivation, but complete structural information on its predicted structural domain is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we measure interactions between the functionally critical distal carboxy terminus Î±-helix (H6) and the proximal structured EF-hand motif using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition-metal</z:chebi> ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measure distances at three loci along H6 relative to an intrinsic tryptophan, demonstrating the proximal-distal interaction in a contiguous carboxy terminus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using these data together with the existing Na(V)1.5 carboxy terminus nuclear magnetic resonance structure, we construct a model of the predicted structured region of the carboxy terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-associated H6 mutant that impairs inactivation decreases fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicating destabilization of the distal-proximal intramolecular interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide a structural correlation to the pathological phenotype of the mutant channel </plain></SENT>
