<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, social processes and their relationship to depressive symptoms have been understudied in adolescent boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low engagement in social contexts may predict depressive symptoms in adolescent boys, as it may signify efforts to reduce social risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, this study focused on 160 boys at risk for affective problems based on low socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated how behavioral and physiological engagement in peer and family contexts, respectively, in late childhood predicted depressive symptoms at age 12 and age 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001361'>Social withdrawal</z:mp> was measured across late childhood (ages 9-12) in a camp setting using a latent variable of teacher ratings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475703" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">withdrawn behavior</z:e>, peer nominations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475703" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">withdrawn behavior</z:e>, and camp counselor ratings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475703" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">withdrawn behavior</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological reactivity was measured during a provocative parent-child conversation using respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) at age 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001361'>Social withdrawal</z:mp> in late childhood predicted depressive symptoms at age 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0001361'>social withdrawal</z:mp> with peers from ages 9-12 and low RSA reactivity with a parent at age 12 predicted higher depressive symptoms at age 15 </plain></SENT>
