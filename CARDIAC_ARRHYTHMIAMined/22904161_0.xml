<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the effects of β-AR stimulation on pacing-induced Ca(2+) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) alternans was recorded from single cat atrial myocytes with the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52084">indo-1</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stable Ca(2+) alternans occurred at an average pacing frequency of 1.7 Hz at room temperature with a mean alternans ratio of 0.43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonselective β-AR stimulation as well as selective stimulation of β(1)/G(s), β(2)/G(s) + G(i), and β(2)/G(s) coupled pathways <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abolished pacing-induced Ca(2+) alternans. β(1)-AR stimulation abolished alternans through stimulation of PKA and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, whereas β(2)-AR stimulation exclusively involved PKA and was mediated via G(s), whereas a known second pathway in cat atrial myocytes acting through G(i) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production was not involved in alternans regulation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selective inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> or glycolytic ATP production did not prevent β-AR stimulation from abolishing Ca(2+) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when both ATP sources were depleted, β-AR stimulation failed to decrease Ca(2+) alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in atrial myocytes, β-AR stimulation protects against pacing-induced alternans by acting through parallel and complementary signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
