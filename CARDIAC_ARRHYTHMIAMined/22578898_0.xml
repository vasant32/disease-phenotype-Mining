<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to compare the incidence of short- and intermediate-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> among 3 different surgical modifications of the Fontan procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent the Fontan operation at a single institution between January 2004 and May 2010 for preoperative, perioperative, and follow-up variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three surgical modifications were studied: intra/extracardiac conduit with limited atriotomy, standard extracardiac conduit, and lateral tunnel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rhythm was classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rhythm dysfunction grading was devised and used to identify worsening of rhythm for patients with abnormal rhythm preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of abnormal rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To eliminate confounding effects of transient immediate postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, data were analyzed for abnormal rhythm within the first 2 weeks and for more than 2 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 134 patients (n = 50 with intra/extracardiac conduit with limited atriotomy, n = 19 with standard extracardiac conduit, n = 65 with lateral tunnel) (median follow-up, 36 months; interquartile range, 22-50 months; 2 operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and 6 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>), rhythm data for more than 2 weeks postoperatively were available in 88 (40 with lateral tunnel, 14 with standard extracardiac conduit, 34 with intra/extracardiac conduit with limited atriotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients constituted the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the lateral tunnel group were relatively younger at the time of the Fontan operation (P &lt; .001) and had a longer follow-up (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression confirmed that greater than moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve regurgitation</z:mp> was the only independent predictor of abnormal rhythm during the first 2 postoperative weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Older age at Fontan (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.38; P = .012) and higher preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.44; P = .026) were predictors of abnormal rhythm more than 2 weeks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intra/extracardiac conduit with limited atriotomy Fontan modification was associated with a significantly lower incidence of abnormal rhythm after 2 weeks postoperatively compared with lateral tunnel modification (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.84; P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra/extracardiac conduit with limited atriotomy Fontan modification has a significantly lower risk of abnormal rhythm postoperatively in the short and intermediate term when compared with the lateral tunnel </plain></SENT>
