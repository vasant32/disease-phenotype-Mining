<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates whether observed autonomic blunting extends to conditions designed to decrease arousal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physiological and psychological responsivity to an 18-min guided imagery relaxation protocol in healthy pregnant women during the 32nd week of gestation (n=54) and non-pregnant women (n=28) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data collection included heart period (HP), respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), tonic and phasic measures of skin conductance (SCL and NS-SCR), respiratory period (RP), and self-reported psychological relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, responses to the manipulation included increased HP, RSA, and RP and decreased SCL and NS-SCR, followed by post-manipulation recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, responsivity was attenuated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physiological measures except RP in pregnant women, despite no difference in self-reported psychological relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings support non-specific blunting of physiological responsivity during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
