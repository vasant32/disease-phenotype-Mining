<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The increasing volume of pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implants and problems related to their functioning have highlighted the issue of device follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients' convenience regarding device visits has been little investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work aims at surveying patients' efforts in attending the in-office PM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> follow-ups and at evaluating their expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In four Italian referral centres, over a 3-month period, a 20-point questionnaire was completed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients at in-hospital PM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 1109 questionnaire/patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pacemakers were 68%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> 16%, and cardiac resynchronizations (CRTs) (PM + <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) 16%; 38% were females; mean age was 75 Â± 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were scheduled visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was frequent reprogramming and clinical examination, even after 6 months from implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perceived inconvenience for the in-office follow-up was relevant in 35% of cases; attitudes towards remote monitoring were positive in 88% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inter-group analysis showed some significant difference: PM patients were older and more frequently female; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> carriers were younger, had the highest rate of clinical evaluation, a longer journey time, and the most positive opinion about remote follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization patients had a longer waiting time and the lowest inconvenience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall inconvenience was independently predicted by increasing age, lengthy travelling times, and being accompanied; favourable opinions about remote monitoring were predicted by overall inconvenience, and, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> carriers only, by lack of clinical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients' perceptions of in-hospital PM/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> visits were affected by age and by journey modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individual factors seem to affect both opinions about in-office visits and expectations towards a possible remote follow-up </plain></SENT>
