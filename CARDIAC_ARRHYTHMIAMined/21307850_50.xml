<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LQTS is commonly genetic in origin but can also be caused or exacerbated by environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore the effect of the Timothy syndrome mutation on the electrical activity and contraction of human cardiomyocytes, we reprogrammed human skin cells from Timothy syndrome patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated these cells into cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological recording and calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging studies of these cells revealed irregular contraction, excess Ca(2+) influx, prolonged action potentials, irregular electrical activity and abnormal calcium transients in ventricular-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that roscovitine, a compound that increases the voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1.2 (refs 6-8), restored the electrical and Ca(2+) signalling properties of cardiomyocytes from Timothy syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides new opportunities for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in humans, and provides a robust assay for developing new drugs to treat these diseases </plain></SENT>
