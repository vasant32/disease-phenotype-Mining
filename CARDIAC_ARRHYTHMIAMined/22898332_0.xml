<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and valve disease divided in 2 groups: group 1 (26 patients) underwent intraoperative radiofrequency ablation and was followed by a team of skilled cardiologists who treated recurrences with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and electrical cardioversion; group 2 (26 patients) was treated with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation but patients were thereafter treated by their local hospital or personal cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or complications related to radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty four months after the operation, freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 60% in group 1 and 32% in group 2 (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 also showed a reduction in atrial volume (pâ‰¤0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postoperative follow up with electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion combined with radiofrequency ablation achieves higher rate of sinus rhythm maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After ablation, electrical cardioversion is effective even in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008726'>enlarged left atrium</z:mp>, long history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or previous failed electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
