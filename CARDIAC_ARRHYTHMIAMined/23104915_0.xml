<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dallas, TX: American Heart Association; 2002) Thus, electrophysiological remodelling associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is a leading cause of disease mortality and has been a major investigational focus examined using many animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While these studies have provided an important foundation for understanding the arrhythmogenic pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, the need for corroborating studies conducted on human heart tissue has been increasingly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many human heart studies of conduction and repolarization remodelling have now been published and shed some light on important, potentially arrhythmogenic, changes in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies are being conducted at multiple experimental scales from isolated cells to whole-tissue preparations and have provided insight into regulatory mechanisms such as decreased protein expression, alternative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing of ion channel genes, and defective cellular trafficking </plain></SENT>
