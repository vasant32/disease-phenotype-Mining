<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant interest has been directed at factors predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> progression, and the HATCH score (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age ≥ 75 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [2 points], COPD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> [2 points]) recently has been proposed as a predictive score for AF progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated long-term outcomes in a large cohort of newly diagnosed lone AF and whether progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF confers an adverse impact on outcomes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was an observational cohort of 346 patients with newly diagnosed lone AF with a mean follow-up of 12.1 ± 7.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline paroxysmal AF was confirmed in 242 patients, and of these, 65 (26.9%) subsequently experienced progression to permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Older age and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> during follow-up were the multivariate predictors of AF progression (both P &lt; .01), which was documented in 19.8% of patients with a HATCH score of 0 vs 63.2% with a score of 2 (P &lt; .001), although the predictive validity of the HATCH score per se was modest (C statistic, 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> during follow-up were low (0.4% each), and five patients (1.4%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF progression, development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, and older age were multivariate predictors of adverse outcomes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline CHADS(2) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age ≥ 75, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) score was not predictive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (C statistic, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This 12-year follow-up study provides confirmatory evidence of a generally favorable prognosis of lone AF, but adverse outcomes (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>) are significantly influenced by age and the (new) development of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> progression in lone AF is a marker of increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
