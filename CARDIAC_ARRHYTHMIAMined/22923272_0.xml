<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Calculation of the inverse solution from body surface potential mapping (sometimes known as ECG imaging) has shown tremendous promise and can rapidly map these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but we lack quantitative assessment of its accuracy in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared inverse solution mapping with computed tomography-registered electroanatomic epicardial contact catheter mapping to study the resolution of this technique, the influence of myocardial scar, and the ability to map VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For 4 patients undergoing epicardial catheter mapping and ablation of VT, 120-lead body surface potential mappings were obtained during implantable defibrillator pacing, catheter pacing from 79 epicardial sites, and induced VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inverse epicardial electrograms computed using individualized torso/epicardial surface geometries extracted from computed tomography images were compared with registered electroanatomic contact maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distance between estimated and actual epicardial pacing sites was 13 Â± 9 mm over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myocardium with no stimulus-QRS delay but increased significantly over scar (P=0.013) or was close to scar (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contact maps during right ventricular pacing correlated closely to inverse solution isochrones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maps of inverse epicardial potentials during 6 different induced VTs indicated areas of earliest activation, which correlated closely with clinically identified VT exit sites for 2 epicardial VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inverse solution maps can identify sites of epicardial pacing with good accuracy, which diminishes over myocardial scar or over slowly conducting tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach can also identify epicardial VT exit sites and ventricular activation sequences </plain></SENT>
