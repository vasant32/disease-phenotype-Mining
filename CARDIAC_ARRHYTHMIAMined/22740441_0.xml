<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 5334 patients presenting with ACS in 65 hospitals in 6 Middle East countries in the 2nd Gulf Registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> Coronary Events (Gulf RACE-2) were studied according to their marital status (5024 married, 100 single, and 210 widowed patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: When compared to married patients, widowed patients were older and more likely to be female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Widowed patients were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> and were less likely to be tobacco users when compared to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Widowed patients were also more likely to present with atypical symptoms and have advanced Killip class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Widowed patients were more likely to present with non-ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (NSTEMI) when compared to the other 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Widowed patients were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (P = 0.001), cardiogenic shock (P = 0.001), and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (P = 0.002) when compared to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was observed in regard to duration of hospital stay, door to needle time in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> between the various groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Widowed patients had higher in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Marital status was an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Widowed marital status was associated with worse cardiovascular risk profile, and worse in-hospital and 1-year outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future work should be focused on whether the provision of psychosocial support will result in improved outcomes among this high-risk group </plain></SENT>
