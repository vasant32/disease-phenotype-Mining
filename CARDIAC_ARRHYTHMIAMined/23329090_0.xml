<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective medical chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients 90 years and older who underwent a free flap reconstruction from 2002 through 2011 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, demographic, and procedural data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications of surgery were either medical or flap related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up was recorded to determine late flap complications, donor site morbidity, and functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 847 free flaps, 10 (1.2%) were performed in patients 90 years and older, with a median follow-up time of 8.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four medical complications (40%) occurred (1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two recipient site complications (20%) occurred (1 infection and 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The flap failure rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One late complication developed 7 months postoperatively involving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and nonunion of the mandibular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was donor site morbidity in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Functional status returned to baseline in 8 patients (80%) at the last follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medical and flap-related complications in patients 90 years and older are consistent with rates previously reported in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients 90 years and older can tolerate free flap reconstruction with favorable long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
