<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible underlying mechanism linking the vagus nerve and disorders is the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three healthy male subjects participated in a stress task, while heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), salivary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, and mood were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vagal function was determined using baseline, stress-induced inhibition, and Cold Face Test (CFT)-induced stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stress task induced a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> and HR, a decrease in RSA, and a worsening of mood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A linear regression model with the time from CFT <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> until maximum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> as the independent variable explained 17.9% of the total variance in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in response to the stressor (mood: 36.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that a faster CFT response is associated with reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> increase and enhanced mood after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data support an inverse relationship between vagal function and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
