<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Mostly, it is impossible to establish the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, based on signs and symptoms only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ECG device is not always within reach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We presumed the heartscan, a handheld wireless device, to be of value to a GP in emergency situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied inter- and intra-observer variability and the accuracy of the screen readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients visiting the emergency department (ED) of the Gasthuisberg University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium, as well as patients hospitalised in three hospital wards on one day, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the heartscan recording, a standard 12-lead ECG was recorded and read by an experienced hospital-based cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recordings were read on the device screen by two general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> readers were blinded to the 12-lead ECG readings and vice versa, and for each other's ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We compared both the heartscan reading of the first reader and the automatic reading of the device with the readings of the second GP and to the 12-lead ECG results, used as the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intra- and inter-observer agreement was studied using total accuracy and kappa values with their 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Full data of 177 (73%) patients, 80 men (45%) and 97 women (55%), with a mean age of 55 years (range 18-94 y) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the heartscan reading by a clinician was 88%, the sensitivity between 60 and 69%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> &lt; 50% and NPV &gt; 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparing codes of the heartscan with the ECG readings was difficult but sensitivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was 92.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intra-observer accuracy were high (&gt; 0.86 and &gt; or = 0.95, respectively), with low kappa values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detection of rhythm disorders by the device is incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the heartscan can be a help for the GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The performance of the heartscan could probably be improved by increasing screen resolution, but, in the future, more sophisticated heart monitors should become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They should be small, light and affordable </plain></SENT>
