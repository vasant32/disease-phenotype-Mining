<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite prior reports concerning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e> through a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, atrial dysfunction and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> might represent an additional mechanism for arterial embolism.The aim of this study was to evaluate right and left atrial appendage contractilty in patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (10 males/20 females, mean age 50.2 +/- 15.3 years) and 30 controls (12 males/ 18 females, mean age 47.7 +/- 10 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional transthoracic and multiplane transoesophageal echocardiography were performed in patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow and myocardial velocity were measured in both atrial appendages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity and myocardial contraction velocity in both atrial appendages were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control group, patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> had a larger length, base and area of both appendages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> patients right and left atrial appendage function are impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biatrial dysfunction may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
