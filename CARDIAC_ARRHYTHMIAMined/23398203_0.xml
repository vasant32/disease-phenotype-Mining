<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at investigating the effect of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> on respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as a measure of cardiac vagal modulation during night-time sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overnight polysomnography was conducted in 40 healthy children (20 M; age: 7.5 ± 2.6 years; body mass index percentile: 60.7 ± 26.4%) and 40 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> (24 M; age: 7.5 ± 2.7 years; body mass index percentile: 65.8 ± 31.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the phase-averaging technique to compute respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> amplitude and phase delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To study sleep stage effects and the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo>, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was measured during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> artefact-free sleep episodes, and after exclusion of respiratory events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> amplitude and phase delay was observed during stage 4 sleep as compared with rapid eye movement sleep in both groups (amplitude: controls = 0.10 ± 0.03 versus 0.07 ± 0.02 s, P &lt; 0.01, respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> = 0.07 ± 0.03 versus 0.05 ± 0.03 s, P &lt; 0.05, respectively; phase delay: controls = 3.1 ± 0.1 versus 3.0 ± 0.1 rad, P &lt; 0.05, respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> = 3.13 ± 0.04 versus 3.04 ± 0.08 rad, P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy controls, a significant decrease in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> amplitude during stage 2 sleep was observed in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> (0.09 ± 0.03 versus 0.06 ± 0.03 s, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
