<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials have not consistently shown these benefits, possibly due to delayed administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test out-of hospital emergency medical service (EMS) administration of GIK in the first hours of suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind effectiveness trial in 13 US cities (36 EMS agencies), from December 2006 through July 31, 2011, in which paramedics, aided by electrocardiograph (ECG)-based decision support, randomized 911 (871 enrolled) patients (mean age, 63.6 years; 71.0% men) with high probability of ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Intravenous GIK solution (n = 411) or identical-appearing 5% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> placebo (n = 460) administered by paramedics in the out-of-hospital setting and continued for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prespecified primary end point was progression of ACS to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) within 24 hours, as assessed by biomarkers and ECG evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prespecified secondary end points included survival at 30 days and a composite of prehospital or in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or in-hospital mortality, analyzed by intent-to-treat and by presentation with ST-segment elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the rate of progression to MI among patients who received GIK (n = 200; 48.7%) vs those who received placebo (n = 242; 52.6%) (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66-1.13; P = .28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 4.4% with GIK vs 6.1% with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.29; P = .27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or in-hospital mortality occurred in 4.4% with GIK vs 8.7% with placebo (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.27-0.85; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients with ST-segment elevation (163 with GIK and 194 with placebo), progression to MI was 85.3% with GIK vs 88.7% with placebo (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.40-1.38; P = .34); 30-day mortality was 4.9% with GIK vs 7.7% with placebo (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.27-1.49; P = .29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The composite outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or in-hospital mortality was 6.1% with GIK vs 14.4% with placebo (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.82; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events occurred in 6.8% (n = 28) with GIK vs 8.9% (n = 41) with placebo (P = .26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with suspected ACS, out-of-hospital administration of intravenous GIK, compared with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> placebo, did not reduce progression to MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, GIK administration was not associated with improvement in 30-day survival but was associated with lower rates of the composite outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
