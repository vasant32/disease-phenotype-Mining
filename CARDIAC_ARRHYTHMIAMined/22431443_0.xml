<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A nationwide cohort study was performed based on data on 28 860 patients from the Danish Pacemaker Register, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish patients who received their first pacemaker (PM) or cardiac resynchronization device from 1997 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals for the association between risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> treated with a chest tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 77 years (25th and 75th percentile: 69-84) and 55% were male (n = 15 785) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 190 patients (0.66%) were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, which was more often in women [aOR 1.9 (1.4-2.6)], and in patients with age &gt;80 years [aOR 1.4 (1.0-1.9)], a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> [aOR 3.9 (1.6-9.5)], implantation of a dual-chamber PM [aOR 1.5 (1.0-2.2)], venous access with subclavian vein puncture [aOR 7.8 (4.9-12.5)], venous access with both subclavian vein puncture and cephalic vein cut-down [aOR 5.7 (3.0-10.8)], and implantation in a non-university centre [aOR 2.1 (1.6-2.9)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>Pneumothorax</z:hpo> treated with a chest tube remains a clinically important problem in device therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cephalic vein cut-down technique should be applied whenever possible to avoid this complication </plain></SENT>
