<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We aimed to determine how many electrical cardioversions (ECs) should be applied to treat repetitive persistent recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) following ablation of persistent AF within the early post-procedural period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 40 patients with &gt;1 episode of recurrent AF in the form of persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> within 3 months following the ablation were recruited from 108 patients who underwent ablation for persistent or long-standing persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrical cardioversions were applied up to six times, if necessary, to restore sinus rhythm at clinical visits at 2-week intervals until 3 months after the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (35%) ablation failures defined as recurrences of AF identified from the 3rd month after the ablation procedure were finally diagnosed during the follow-up period (14 ± 4 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with an ablation failure more frequently required ECs than those without (3.7 ± 0.3 vs. 1.2 ± 0.2 times; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A receiver-operating characteristic curve identified a number of ECs of ≥3 as the optimal cut-off value for predicting an ablation failure (area under the curve 0.91; sensitivity, 86%, and specificity, 96%; P = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, a number of ECs of ≥3 was the only independent predictor of an ablation failure (odds ratio, 11.32; 95% confidence interval, 3.83-58.22; P = 0.0019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was difficult to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF who required several ECs for recurrences of AF within the early post-ablation period </plain></SENT>
