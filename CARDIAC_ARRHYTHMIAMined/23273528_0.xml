<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF care requires specific arrhythmologic skills and complex treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is crucial to know its real affect on healthcare systems to allocate resources and detect areas for improving the standards of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present nationwide, retrospective, observational study involved 233 general practitioners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each general practitioner completed an electronic questionnaire to provide information on the clinical profile, treatment strategies, and resources consumed to care for their patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 295,906 patients screened, representative of the Italian population, 6,036 (2.04%) had AF: 20.2% paroxysmal, 24.3% persistent, and 55.5% permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AF occurred in 0.16% of patients aged 16 to 50 years, 9.0% of those aged 76 to 85 years, and 10.7% of those aged ≥85 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF was symptomatic despite therapy in 74.6% of patients and was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with AF, 24.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 26.8% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, 18% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and 29.3% had ≥3 co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate control treatment strategy was pursued in 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 6,036 patients with AF, 46% received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The success rate of catheter ablation of the AF substrate was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in our study, the frequency of AF was 2 times greater than previously reported (approximately 0.90%), rate control was the most pursued treatment strategy, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were still underused, and the success rate of AF ablation was lower than reported by referral centers </plain></SENT>
