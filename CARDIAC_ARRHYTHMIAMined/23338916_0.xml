<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) is common and affects a significant number of people annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurs due to either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As leucocytosis, especially elevated neutrophil count, is a hallmark of inflammatory reactions in patients with MI, we investigated the relationship between leucocytosis on admission and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were enrolled in a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples obtained in the first 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain were analysed for cardiac enzyme levels and cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed on Days 3-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with LVEF &lt; 45% were assigned to the left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction group (n = 69) and those with LVEF â‰¥ 45% were taken as controls (n = 69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were matched for variables such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e>, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leucocytosis was higher in patients with systolic dysfunction (47.8%) when compared with the controls (20.3%), and was significantly associated with the development of LV systolic dysfunction (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> was more common in patients with systolic dysfunction than the controls (6.6% vs. 34.8%), and was significantly associated with LV systolic dysfunction (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>Monocytosis</z:mp> was higher in the controls than the systolic dysfunction group (40.6% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.378) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Leucocytosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of MI are important predictive factors for the development of LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Leucocytosis can be used for risk stratification of such patients </plain></SENT>
