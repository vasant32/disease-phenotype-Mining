<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data collected by the US Renal Data System (USRDS) identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) as the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence suggests that clinical events captured on the USRDS <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification form may be inaccurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new method for classifying SCD was recently developed to enhance the accuracy of SCD classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the performance characteristics of this refined definition using a cohort of hemodialysis patients who experienced a witnessed SCD as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 363 patients who experienced a witnessed SCD in US Gambro (DaVita) outpatient dialysis clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of SCD defined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification forms and SCD defined using additional administrative sources was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data recorded near time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Existing USRDS <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification forms reported 70.8% of witnessed SCD as "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>/cause unknown" or "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>." The refined definition significantly improved identification to 83.8% of witnessed SCD events (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Verified SCD cases that were not identified by either definition were more likely to be reported on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification form as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification form alone, the refined SCD definition significantly improves the sensitivity of reporting of witnessed SCD occurring within outpatient hemodialysis clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More accurate reporting of cardiac events by clinicians and refinements to existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> notification forms may further improve recognition and understanding of SCD </plain></SENT>
