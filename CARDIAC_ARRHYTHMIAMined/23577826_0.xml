<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transtelephonic monitors (TTMs) are cumbersome to use and provide limited temporal assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) may overcome these limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the utility of ILRs versus conventional monitoring (CM) in patients undergoing AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-four patients undergoing AF ablation received ILRs and CM (30-day TTM at discharge and months 5 and 11 postablation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the initial 6 months, clinical decisions were made based on CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were then randomized for the remaining 6 months to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> assessment and management by ILR versus CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was actionable clinical events (change of antiarrhythmic drugs [AADs], anticoagulation, non-AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> events, etc.) due to either monitoring strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over the study period, 6 patients withdrew </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first 6 months, AF recurred in 18 patients (7 noted by CM, 18 by ILR; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients in the CM (28%) and 5 in the ILR arm (25%; P = NS) had AF recurrence during the latter 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AF was falsely diagnosed frequently by ILR (730 of 1,421 episodes; 51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In more patients in the ILR compared with the CM arm, rate control agents (60% vs 39%, P = 0.02) and AADs (71% vs 44%, P = 0.04) were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In AF ablation patients, ILR can detect more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> than CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, false detection remains a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With adequate oversight, ILRs may be useful in monitoring these patients after ablation </plain></SENT>
