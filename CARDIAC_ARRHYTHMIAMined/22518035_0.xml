<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the experience of a high-volume centre with thoracolaparoscopy radical oesophagectomy and to evaluate the feasibility, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> clearance, the learning curve and reproducibility of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty patients with thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oesophageal cancer</z:e> who underwent thoracolaparoscopic oesophagectomy (TLE) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two attending surgeons (Mingqiang Kang and Ruobai Lin) independently performed the procedure as operating surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 60 patients who had surgery performed on them by the senior attending surgeon, Mingqiang Kang, were divided into three groups of 20 patients: groups A, B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from the three groups were compared in order to detect any changes in the success of TLE as a way of monitoring the development of the surgeon's technical skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another 20 patients had surgery performed on them by the new attending surgeon, Ruobai Lin, and were classified into the fourth group, D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from Group D were compared with those of the other three groups to evaluate the reproducibility of our technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the four groups with respect to age, gender, location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> or staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of both the thoracoscopic and laparoscopic procedures was significantly longer in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The amount of estimated blood loss was significantly more in Group A than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of lymph nodes dissected was similar in Groups A and D, whereas that of retrieved nodes was larger in Groups B and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of respiratory complications, recurrent nerve palsy, anastomotic leaks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009854'>delayed gastric emptying</z:mp> among the four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When TLE procedures are started in units with a large volume of oesophageal resections, and when there is support from colleagues within the unit, transition from open to TLE can be achieved safely, with a satisfactory oncological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A plateau of TLE skill was reached after 40 cases had been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If mini-fellowship training with supervision from senior surgeons is used, it is possible for a new attending surgeon to attain the requisite basic skill to perform TLE in a relatively short period of time </plain></SENT>
