<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that the suboptimal performance of the San Francisco <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> Rule (SFSR) is likely due to the misclassification of the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo> (ECG)" variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify specific emergency department (ED) ECG and cardiac monitor abnormalities that better predict cardiac outcomes within 30 days in adult ED <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This health records review included patients 16 years or older with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and excluded patients with ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, alcohol or illicit drug use, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, head injury leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo>, or severe trauma requiring admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected patient characteristics, 22 ECG variables, cardiac monitoring abnormalities, SFSR "<z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp>" criteria, and outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or cardiac procedures) data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recursive partitioning was used to develop the "Ottawa Electrocardiographic Criteria." RESULTS: Among 505 included patient visits, 27 (5.3%) had serious cardiac outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that patients were at risk for cardiac outcomes within 30 days if any of the following were present: second-degree Mobitz type 2 or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> with first-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp>, right bundle branch with left anterior or posterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fascicular block</z:e>, new ischemic changes, nonsinus rhythm, left axis deviation, or ED cardiac monitor abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of the Ottawa Electrocardiographic Criteria were 96% (95% CI 80-100) and 76% (95% CI 75-76), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We successfully identified specific ED ECG and cardiac monitor abnormalities, which we termed the Ottawa Electrocardiographic Criteria, that predict serious cardiac outcomes in adult ED <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to identify which adult ED <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> patients require cardiac monitoring in the ED and the optimal duration of monitoring and to confirm the accuracy of these criteria </plain></SENT>
