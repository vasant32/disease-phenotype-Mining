<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one canines: group I (n = 7) received a surgical right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) transannular patch plus pulmonary valve destruction; group II (n = 5) received RBB ablation and sham operation; and group III (n = 9) received combined interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial electrophysiological data were obtained up to 1 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Procedure mortality was 27.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 y, although severe <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> was documented in most dogs in groups I (71%) and III (100%), progressive RVOT <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was noted in group III </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> events were frequent in group III (median 3.3/mo) but uncommon in groups I and II (median 1/mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have created a novel animal model that adequately reflects both the hemodynamic and electrophysiological characteristics of repaired TOF patients and can be applied to examine the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
