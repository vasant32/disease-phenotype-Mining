<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Single clinical parameters are inaccurate for diagnostic and prognostic estimation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiac marker NT-pro-BNP has not thoroughly been evaluated for this application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NT-pro-BNP was assessed in 161 consecutive patients (median age 69 years, 58% male) hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in a cardiological university department and association (odds ratio: OR, 95% confidence interval: CI) with diagnosis of cardiac cause and 6-months outcome was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NT-pro-BNP levels were significantly higher in patients with cardiac (n=78) compared to non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (n=83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a cutoff of 156 pg/ml, NT-pro-BNP showed a sensitivity of 89.7%, a specificity of 51.8% and a negative predictive value of 84.3% for the diagnosis of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing NT-pro-BNP was a significant predictor of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.3-5.8 per standard deviation of Log NT-pro-BNP, p&lt;0.001) and addition of NT-pro-BNP significantly improved a predictive model including heart rate, history of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adding left-ventricular ejection fraction to the model did not change results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients had an adverse event during hospitalization or 6-months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NT-pro-BNP&gt;156 pg/ml significantly predicted an adverse outcome (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.04-6.9, p=0.04) after multivariate adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, NT-pro-BNP was a strong and independent diagnostic and prognostic marker and addition to conventional criteria of history and examination improved the discriminatory performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials must clarify the benefit and position of NT-pro-BNP in the management algorithm of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
