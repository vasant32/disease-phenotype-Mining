<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the incidence of SND in subjects with type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 68 individuals (55 males, mean age 44.8±12.8 years) with spontaneous (n=27) or drug-induced (n=41) type 1 ECG pattern of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight subjects were symptomatic with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SND was observed in 6 symptomatic subjects (8.8%), and was mainly attributed to sino-atrial block with sinus pauses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients were initially diagnosed with SND, and received a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with SND displayed an increased P-wave duration in leads II and V2, PR interval in leads II and V2, QRS duration in leads II and V2, and increased QTc interval in lead V2 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AH and HV intervals as well as corrected sinus node recovery time (cSNRT) were significantly prolonged in subjects with SND (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 5.0±3.6 years, five subjects with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> suffered appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) discharges due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of those diagnosed with SND suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SND is not an uncommon finding in subjects with type 1 ECG pattern of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of SND in relatively young patients may deserve meticulous investigation including <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blocking test </plain></SENT>
