<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 290 pregnant women, including 313 fetuses, who were examined by fetal echoCG at the Seoul National University Children's Hospital from January 2008 through April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 26.2±5.2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of mothers at diagnosis was 31.7±3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified indications for fetal echoCG in 279 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common indication was abnormal cardiac findings in obstetrical screening sonography (52.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 313 echoCG results, 127 (40.6%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 13 (4.2%) were minor abnormalities, 35 (11.2%) were simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo>, 50 (16.0%) were moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo>, 60 (19.2%) were complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo>, 16 (5.1%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and 12 (3.8%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015958" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">twin-to-twin transfusion</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (23 fetuses, 15.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-eight neonates were examined by echoCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We analyzed differences between fetal echoCG and postnatal echoCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 131 (88.5%) cases, there was no difference; in 15 (10.1%), there were minor differences; and in only 2 (1.4%) cases, there were major differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is a recent increase in abnormal cardiac findings of obstetric ultrasonography screenings that indicate fetal echoCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fetal echoCG is still a good, accurate diagnostic method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
