<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ARVC is a genetically determined disorder, usually caused by point mutations in components of the cardiac desmosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional mutation screening of ARVC genes fails to detect causative mutations in about 50% of index cases, suggesting a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide linkage study and a copy number variations (CNVs) analysis, using high-density SNP arrays, in an ARVC family showing no mutations in any of the desmosomal genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CNVs analysis identified a heterozygous deletion of about 122â€‰kb on chromosome 12p11.21, including the entire plakophilin-2 gene and shared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was not listed on any of available public CNVs databases and was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first SNP array-based genome-wide study leading to the identification of a CNV segregating with the disease phenotype in an ARVC family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result underscores the importance of performing additional analysis for possible genomic deletions/duplications in ARVC patients without point mutations in known disease genes.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 13 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.39 </plain></SENT>
