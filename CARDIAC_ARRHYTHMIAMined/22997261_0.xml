<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> are due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and abnormalities in the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system could underlie them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> is associated with alterations of fetal development as a result of variations in the processes of placentation that control fetal nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that placental size would be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> within the Helsinki Birth Cohort of 13 345 men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred eighty-seven (2.7%) men and 47 (0.7%) women had sudden unexplained cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outside hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> was associated with a thin placenta, the hazard ratio being 1.47 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.93, P = 0.006] for each g/cm(2) decrease in thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> was independently associated with poor educational attainment (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both of these associations were independent of socio-economic status in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> may be initiated by impaired development of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in utero as a result of shallow invasion of the spiral arteries in the maternal endometrium and consequent fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
