<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the role of each of these factors in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aberrant cardiac electric activation, with particular emphasis on the effects of 3-dimensional myocyte architecture at the tissue scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis draws on findings from in vivo and in vitro experiments, as well as biophysically based computer models that have been used to integrate and interpret these experimental data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It indicates that discontinuous arrangement of myocytes and extracellular connective tissue at the tissue scale can give rise to current source-to-sink mismatch, spatiotemporal distribution of refractoriness, and rate-sensitive electric instability, which contribute to the initiation and maintenance of reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This exacerbates the risk of rhythm disturbance associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that structure-based, multiscale computer models that incorporate accurate information about local cellular electric activity provide a powerful platform for investigating the basis of reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it is important that these models capture key features of structure and related electric function at the tissue scale </plain></SENT>
