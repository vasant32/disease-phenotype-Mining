<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two most widely used systems are NavX Fusion and Cartomerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of these systems in a randomised trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing their first ablation were randomised to mapping using either NavX fusion or CartoMerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation by wide area circumferential ablation was performed for paroxysmal AF with additional linear and fractionated potential ablation for persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven-day Holter monitoring was used for confirmation of sinus rhythm maintenance at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were randomised and underwent a procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the primary endpoint of freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at 6 months (51% in the Cartomerge group vs. 48% in the NavX Fusion group, p = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3D image registration was faster with Cartomerge (24 vs. 33 min, p =��0.0001), used less fluoroscopic screening (11 vs. 15 min, p = 0.039) with a lower fluoroscopic dose (840 vs. 1,415 mGyCm(2), p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a strong trend to lower ablation times in the Cartomerge group, overall RF time (3,292 s vs. 4,041, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distance from 3D lesion to 3D image shell was smaller in the Cartomerge group (2.7 ± 1.9 vs. 3.3 ± 3.7 mm, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cartomerge appears to be faster and uses less fluoroscopy to achieve registration than NavX Fusion, but overall procedural times and clinical outcomes are similar </plain></SENT>
