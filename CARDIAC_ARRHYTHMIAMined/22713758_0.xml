<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized the electrophysiological benefits of engrafting human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in a model of arrhythmogenic cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using transforming growth factor-β treated monolayers of neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs), which retain several key aspects of the healing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> such as an excess of contractile myofibroblasts and slowed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> conduction, we assessed the ability of hESC-CMs to improve conduction and prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells from beating embryoid bodies (hESC-CMs) can form functional monolayers which beat spontaneously and can be electrically stimulated, with mean action potential duration of 275 ± 36 ms and conduction velocity (CV) of 10.6 ± 4.2 cm/s (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cells, or cells from non-beating embryoid bodies (hEBCs) were added to anisotropic, NRVC monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining demonstrated hESC-CM survival and engraftment, and dye transfer assays confirmed functional coupling between hESC-CMs and NRVCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocities significantly increased in anisotropic NRVC monolayers after engraftment of hESC-CMs (13.4 ± 0.9 cm/s, n = 35 vs. 30.1 ± 3.2 cm/s, n = 20 in the longitudinal direction and 4.3 ± 0.3 cm/s vs. 9.3 ± 0.9 cm/s in the transverse direction), but decreased to even lower values after engraftment of non-cardiac hEBCs (to 10.6 ± 1.3 cm/s and 3.1 ± 0.5 cm/s, n = 11, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reentrant wave vulnerability in NRVC monolayers decreased by 20% after engraftment of hESC-CMs, but did not change with engraftment of hEBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the culture of hESC-CMs in transwell inserts, which prevents juxtacrine interactions, or engraftment with connexin43-silenced hESC-CMs provided no functional improvement to NRVC monolayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that hESC-CMs can reverse the slowing of conduction velocity, reduce the incidence of reentry, and augment impaired electrical propagation via gap junction coupling to host cardiomyocytes in this arrhythmogenic in vitro model </plain></SENT>
