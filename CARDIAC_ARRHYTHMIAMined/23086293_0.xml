<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ventilation in a prone position was found to improve ventilation and perfusion relationships and reduction in the pleural pressure gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In hypoxemic lung failure (PaO(2)/FIO(2) &lt;100) a prone position was found to improve oxygenation as a rescue measure and to improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast CLRT is considered to be an early therapeutic or prophylactic measure aimed at prevention of ventilation-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In trauma patients these beneficial effects were demonstrated in several studies </plain></SENT>
