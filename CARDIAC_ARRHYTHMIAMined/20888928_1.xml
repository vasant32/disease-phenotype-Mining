<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fasciculoventricular pathways occurring in the setting of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> storage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> possess unique features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical, ECG, and electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway, with or without <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> storage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway were compared: group A consisted of 10 patients with the PRKAG2 mutation (Arg302gln), and group B consisted of 9 patients without the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty percent of group A patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>, and none had an additional accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group B patients had no structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and 33% had an additional accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A patients had a slower resting heart rate (56 ± 7 vs 75 ± 10 bpm, P &lt;0.0001), a wider QRS complex (0.15 ± 0.01 vs 0.11 ± 0.02 ms, P = .0004), and a longer HV interval (34 ± 1 vs 25 ± 3 ms, P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up, 50% of group A patients developed complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> versus none in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of group A patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No Group B patient had any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during follow-up after successful ablation of additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was induced in any patient from either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with a fasciculoventricular pathway associated with the PRKAG2 mutation have distinct clinical, ECG, and electrophysiologic profiles and should be correctly identified because of their ominous long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients without the mutation have an excellent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free prognosis after treatment of additional circuits </plain></SENT>
