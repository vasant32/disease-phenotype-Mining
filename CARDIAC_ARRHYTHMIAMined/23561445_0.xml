<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we do not know their characteristics and economic costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the epidemiology and cost of hospitalizations due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the National Health System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The characteristics and costs were reviewed in patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (1997-2010;diagnosis related groups [DRG] -138 and 139 of the National Health System minimum data base set) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter accounted for 65% of these DRGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary diagnoses prevalent in such DRGs were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hospitalizations due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were approximately 26.000 per year and close to 1.6% for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2010 there were 26.421 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of 65 million Euros </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequent comorbidities were recorded, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (43%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (12%) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 43% were admitted to cardiology and 36% to internal medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the period 1997-2010, there was a significant annual number of hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>), with measurable costs, in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than one third were attended by internists </plain></SENT>
