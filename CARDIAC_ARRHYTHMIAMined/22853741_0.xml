<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to clarify and reevaluate the cardiac and autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> effects of T-2 toxin, which had been previously examined by several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> experiments, in unrestrained and conscious rats implanted with telemetric transmitters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of rats were given two subcutaneous injections of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg of T-2 toxin with an interval of 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two other groups of rat were pre-implanted with osmotic minipumps by which <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg/day) or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (100 mg/kg/day) was continuously administered preceding subcutaneous injection of T-2 toxin (0.5 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that T-2 toxin caused marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, such as second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>, supraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp>, and ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp>, which were accompanied by a significant increase in heart rate and a significant decrease in total power and low- and high-frequency power of heart rate variability, during 3 days of observation after the toxin administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with conduction disturbance such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011706'>second-degree atrioventricular blocks</z:hpo> was markedly diminished by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, while the occurrence of ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp> was augmented by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study with the telemetric measurement elucidated and confirmed that T-2 toxin produced significant cardiac dysfunctions involving disturbance of the conduction pathway influenced by the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity and also possible direct effects on cardiac myocytes </plain></SENT>
