<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and early complications may be the cause of long term morbidity and mortality after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) seems to be most significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate whether preoperative hsCRP (≥3 mg/dl) can predict post-elective off-pump CABG, AF, and early complications in patients with severe left ventricle dysfunction (Ejection Fraction (EF)&lt;30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted on 104 patients with severe left ventriclar dysfunction (EF &lt; 30%), undergoing elective off-pump CABG surgery during April to September 2011 at the Afshar Cardiovascular Center in Yazd, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing emergency surgery and those with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> higher than 2.0 mg/dl, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or immunosuppressive disease were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into two groups: Group I with preoperative increased hsCRP (&gt;3 mg/dl) (n=51) and group N with preoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hsCRP (&lt;3 mg/dl) (n=53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We evaluated post-CABG variables including incidence, duration, and frequency of AF, early morbidity (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, renal and respiratory dysfunctions), ICU or hospital stay and early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were then analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square and Fisher exact test for quantitative and qualitative variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 62.5 years, 75 cases (72.1%) were male, and 39 (37.5%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative AF occurred in 19 cases (18.2%); 17 cases (33.3%) had hsCRP≥3 mg/dl and 2 cases (3.8%) had hsCRP≤3 mg/dl (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative midsternotomy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035243" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTI">infection, respiratory</z:e> dysfunction, and hospital stay were significantly higher in group I compared with group N (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No statistical significant differences were identified between the two groups concerning other postoperative complications (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and ICU stay) (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Preoperative hsCRP ≥3 mg/dl can predict incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and early complications such as midsternotomy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035243" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTI">infection, respiratory</z:e> dysfunction, and hospital stay following elective off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
