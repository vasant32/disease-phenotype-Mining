<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The electrocardiography (ECG) was the simplest and common adjunctive diagnostic tool for cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to clarify the findings of ECG in patients with CA in order to early identification of CA according to the findings of ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 276 patients with diagnosis of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2000 to December 2011, were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were classified according to the cardiac involvement or not, namely CA (n = 189) and control (n = 87) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low voltage on limb leads defined by the amplitude of the QRS complex in each limb leads ≤0.5 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern defined by the presence of pathologic Q waves on at least two contiguous leads on ECG without obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 55 ± 12 (15-88) years, 168 patients (61%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (15.9% vs 3.4%, P = 0.003), low voltage on limb leads (54.5% vs 20.7%, P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (14.8% vs 1.1%, P = 0.001) and pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern (40.2% vs 4.6%, P &lt; 0.001) were more prevalent in CA than control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of low voltage on limb leads and pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern was more common (28.0% vs 2.3%, P &lt; 0.001) in CA than control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the presence of low voltage on limb leads and pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern for the diagnosis of CA were 28%, 98%, 96%, and 39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In CA patients, low voltage on limb leads and pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern were the most common ECG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> were the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in CA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of low voltage on limb leads and pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern had high specificity and positive predictive value for the diagnosis of CA </plain></SENT>
