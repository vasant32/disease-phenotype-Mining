<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 30 genes have been reported to cause <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To provide new insights into the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, a mutational screening on 4 DCM-causing genes (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and LMNA) was performed in a cohort of 105 unrelated <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> (64 familial cases and 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases) using a High Resolution Melting (HRM)/sequencing strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening of a highly conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region in exon 9 of RBM20 was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen different mutations were identified in 20 index patients (19%), including 10 novels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included 8 LMNA variants in 9 (8.6%) probands, 5 TNNT2 variants in 5 probands (4.8%), 4 MYH7 variants in 3 probands (3.8%), 1 TNNI3 variant in 1 proband (0.9%), and 1 RBM20 variant in 1 proband (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One proband was double-heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LMNA mutations represent the most prevalent genetic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients carrying LMNA mutations exhibit conduction system defects and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study also showed than prevalence of mutations affecting TNNI3 or the (RS)-rich region of RBM20 is lower than 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The discovery of novel <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> mutations is crucial for clinical management of patients and their families because pre-symptomatic diagnosis is possible and precocious intervention could prevent or ameliorate the prognosis </plain></SENT>
