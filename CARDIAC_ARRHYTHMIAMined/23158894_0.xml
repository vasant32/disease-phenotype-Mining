<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> have a significantly higher mortality than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of non-cardiac causes, while patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of unknown aetiology constitute an intermediate risk group, presumably because this group is mixed, which suggests that further diagnostic testing is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective single-centre study evaluating the diagnostic yield of an implantable loop recorder (ILR) in establishing the cause of recurrent, unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 44 patients received ILR between 2007 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were available for 39 patients, the mean age was 63 years (range 23-94 years), 59% were female and the mean follow-up period was 349 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average time to first recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> with ECG documentation was 244 days (range 11-699 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up for the total population was 349 days (range 11-1,083 days) and for the group without recurrence 460 days (range 176-1,083 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were obtained in 22 patients (56%) of which the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> was cardiac in 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ILR was an effective tool to establish an arrhythmic cause of the recurrent, unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and useful in ruling out <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New studies are needed to demonstrate whether very prolonged monitoring in case of absent recurrence may further improve the diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there is much need for randomized controlled trials to investigate whether ILR-guided therapy reduces recurrence rate and mortality </plain></SENT>
