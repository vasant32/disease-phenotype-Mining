<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The utility of ambulatory (Holter) monitoring in predicting these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of Holter monitoring in patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of patients with CHD who had undergone Holter monitoring was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Holter data from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (TOF), d-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) after an atrial switch operation, and patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> after Fontan palliation were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Holter indication included evaluation of clinical symptoms or as a part of routine screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Holter results were deemed clinically significant if they resulted in a change in patient treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sudden cardiac events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and appropriate defibrillator therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 589 Holter studies were performed in 189 patients (100 with TOF, 38 with d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, and 51 with Fontan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of Holter monitoring performed for clinical symptoms had a low positive predictive value (0.08) for clinically significant changes in management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On routine monitoring, the sensitivity was low (0.40) but the negative predictive value was high (0.96) for future clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clinically significant findings and associated cost-effectiveness improved with older patient age and Fontan and d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> CHD type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was associated with sudden cardiac events in patients with TOF but not in those with d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> or Fontan palliation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Holter monitoring is generally inefficient for symptomatic evaluation; however, within specific age and CHD type subgroups, such as patients with repaired TOF &gt;25 years old, it could be useful in clinical management and risk assessment as a part of routine care </plain></SENT>
