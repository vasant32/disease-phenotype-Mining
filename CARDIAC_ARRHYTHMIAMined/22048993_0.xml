<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the experience in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> centre with a standardized education and teaching protocol for patients with vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment of vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> is often complex and discouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides medical options, behaviour modification is a main component of therapy but has no statistical evidence to support its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 1999 and September 2006, we prospectively enrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were counselled about the benign nature of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific recommendations were made according to a standardized education protocol established at our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pre-/post-study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of our approach on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurrence and frequency of injury as the study endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up data were available from 85% of the study population (316 of 371) after a mean time of 710 ± 286 days (mean age 50 years; standard deviation ± 18 years, 160 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven patients (27.5%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurrence with 22 suffering an injury during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> burden per month was significantly reduced from 0.35 ± 0.03 at initial presentation to 0.08 ± 0.02 (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> was significantly lower at the time of recurrence compared with the initial presentation (25 vs. 42%; McNemar's test P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A standardized education protocol significantly reduces traumatic injuries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurrence in patients with vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
