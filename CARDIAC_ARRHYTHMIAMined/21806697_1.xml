<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) on progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Progression to persistent AF may occur in up to 50% of patients with paroxysmal AF receiving pharmacological therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, age, prior transient ischemic event, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HATCH score) have been identified as independent risk factors for progression of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RFA was performed in 504 patients (mean age: 58 ± 10 years) to eliminate paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A repeat RFA procedure was performed in 193 patients (38%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical variables predictive of outcome and their relation to progression of AF after RFA were assessed using multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 27 ± 12 months after RFA, 434/504 patients (86%) were in sinus rhythm; 49/504 patients (9.5%) continued to have paroxysmal AF; and 14 (3%) were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 504 patients, 7 (1.5%) progressed to persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with recurrent AF after RFA, paroxysmal AF progressed to persistent AF in 7/56 (13%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The progression rate of AF was 0.6% per year after RFA (P &lt; 0.001 compared to 9% per year reported in pharmacologically treated patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age &gt;75 years, duration of AF &gt;10 years and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were independent predictors of progression to persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The HATCH score was not significantly different between patients with paroxysmal AF who did and did not progress to persistent AF (0.7 ± 0.8 vs 1.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a historical control group of pharmacologically treated patients with paroxysmal AF, RFA appears to reduce the rate of progression of paroxysmal AF to persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age, duration of AF, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are independent risk factors for progression to persistent AF after RFA </plain></SENT>
