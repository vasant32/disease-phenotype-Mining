<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in timing of AF recurrence may depend on different types of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms involved in early AF recurrence in patients with short-lasting AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with short-lasting persistent AF undergoing rhythm control (n= 100) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Markers of mechanisms involved in the initiation and perpetuation of AF were assessed, including clinical factors, echocardiographic parameters, and biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint was early AF recurrence (recurrence &lt;1 month) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoint was progression to permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median total AF history was short: 4.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early AF recurrences occurred in 30 patients (30%) after a median of 6 (inter-quartile range 2-14) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline log(2) interleukin (IL)-6 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-1.7, P= 0.02] and present or previous smoking (adjusted HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-10.9, P= 0.03) were independently associated with early AF recurrence, suggesting that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> played an important role in early recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> became permanent in 29 patients (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline transforming growth factor-Î²1, left ventricular ejection fraction, and early AF recurrence were independently associated with progression to permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with short-lasting AF, early AF recurrence seemed to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as represented by IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment aimed against <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may therefore prevent early AF recurrences, which can improve rhythm control outcome </plain></SENT>
