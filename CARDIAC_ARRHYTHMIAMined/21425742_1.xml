<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, radiofrequency ablation is the curative treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the importance of accessory pathway location in the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study based on the clinical and electrophysiological data of 858 consecutive patients undergoing accessory pathway radiofrequency ablation in our hospital between November 1997 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 37.2 +/- 19.8 years (56.0% males); most patients were symptomatic (94.2%) and without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (95.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of concealed pathways was 28.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slightly over half of the patients were on antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anatomical distribution of the accessory pathways was as follows: left ventricular free wall (LVFW) (53.8%), posteroseptal (25.6%), right ventricular free wall (7.7%), anteroseptal (4.3%), midseptal (3.5%) and multiple (5.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate was highest in LVFW accessory pathways (97.0%) and lowest in multiple accessory pathways (88.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant complications occurred in 0.5% of cases, midseptal and anteroseptal accessory pathways being most affected (3.3% and 2.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At one-year follow-up there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and 4.4% of patients had recurrence of accessory pathway conduction, with no significant differences between anatomical locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical position of the accessory pathway affects the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
