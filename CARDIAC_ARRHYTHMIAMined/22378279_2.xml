<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LQTS is estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:5000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The knowledge of genetic variation in the general population has until recently been limited, but newly published data from NHLBI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e> Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) has provided important knowledge on this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants in ESP (5400 individuals), in order to identify possible false-positive LQTS variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this aim, we performed a search for previously published LQTS-associated variants in ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a PolyPhen-2 prediction was conducted, and the four most prevalent LQTS-associated variants with significant functional effects present in ESP were genotyped in a second control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 33 missense variants previously associated with LQTS in ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These 33 variants affected 173 alleles and this corresponded to a LQTS prevalence of 1:31 in the ESP population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PolyPhen-2 predicted 30% of the 33 variants present in ESP to be benign compared with 13% among LQTS-associated variants not present in ESP (P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the four variants KCNH2 P347S; SCN5A: S216L, V1951L; and CAV3 T78M in the control population (n=704) revealed prevalences comparable to those of ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, we identified a much higher prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants than expected in exome data from population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Great caution regarding the possible disease causation of some of these variants has to be taken, especially when used for risk stratification in family members </plain></SENT>
