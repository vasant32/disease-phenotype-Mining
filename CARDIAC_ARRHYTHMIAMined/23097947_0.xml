<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has increased markedly over the past four decades; however, some reports suggest a recent plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little information available regarding recent changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> prevalence among patients hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> trends among patients hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> between 2002 and 2009 at an academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective database analysis of patients admitted with cardiovascular diagnoses in 2002 versus 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 codes, the study population was generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (Quetelet index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to 1 of 5 BMI categories: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight (BMI &lt; 19-24.99), overweight (BMI 25-29.99), Grades I <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI 30-34.99), Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI 35-39.99), and Grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (BMI &gt; 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics are compared with Student's T-tests for continuous data and chi2 tests for categorical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were developed in the overall cohort to ascertain differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> grades I, II &amp; III between the two time points with age, gender, race and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code included as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression models were then repeated for each primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 code </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients admitted with cardiovascular diagnoses in 2002 (n = 1271) and 2009 (n = 1576) were stratified by BMI categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over this period of nine years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> prevalence increased significantly from 28.5% to 38.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, Grades II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> increased markedly from 2002 to 2009 (7.6% versus 9.9%, and 2.7% versus 7.5%; unadjusted p = 0.04, p &lt; 0.001 and adjusted p = 0.09 and p &lt; 0.0001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individuals with Grade III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Grade II and III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> has markedly increased among patients admitted to our hospital with major cardiovascular diagnoses in the period 2002 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With respect to hospitalized patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic is still on a steeply rising trajectory, especially for the extremely <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> categories </plain></SENT>
