<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (NYHA II, III), with a mean age of 56 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They participated in an eight-week programme of home cardiac rehabilitation which was telemonitored with a device which recorded 16-s fragments of their ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These fragments were transmitted via mobile phone to a monitoring centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The times of the automatic ECG recordings were pre-set and coordinated with the cardiac rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were able to make additional recordings when they felt unwell using a tele-event-Holter ECG facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the study, 5757 HTCR sessions were recorded and 11,534 transmitted ECG fragments were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most ECGs originated from the automatic recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Singular supraventricular and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> and ventricular couplets were detected in 16%, 69% and 16% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty ECGs were recorded when patients felt unwell: non sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> occurred in three patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> episode in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> patients undergoing HTCR did not develop any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> which required a change of the procedure, confirming it was safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiac rehabilitation at home was improved by utilizing the tele-event-Holter ECG facility </plain></SENT>
