<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed detailed electrophysiologic (EP) and electroanatomic (EA) studies of the right atrium (RA) in patients with AF and AFL to determine substrate differences that may explain the preferential expression of AF/AFL in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with AF (n = 13) were compared to patients with persistent AFL (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies were performed, and 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping studies were created and the RA was divided into 4 segments for regional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global, septal, lateral, anterior, and posterior segments were compared for analysis of: bipolar voltage; proportion of low-voltage areas and areas of electrical silence; conduction times; and proportion of abnormal signals (fractionated signals and double potentials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to patients with AF, patients with AFL had (1) lower bipolar voltage and an increase in the proportion of low-voltage areas; (2) an increase in the proportion of complex signals; and (3) prolongation of activation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AFL showed more advanced remodeling than patients with AF with slowed conduction, lower voltage areas with regions of electrical silence, and a greater proportion of complex signals, particularly in the posterior RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes facilitate the stabilization of AFL and may explain why some patients are more likely to develop AFL as a sustained clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
