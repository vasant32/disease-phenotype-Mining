<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to explore the mechanism of racemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus node and damaged sinus node (SND) groups, and each group was randomly divided into treatment and control groups (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SND model was established by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> wet dressing of the sinus node area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment groups were administered an intravenous infusion of 0.04 mg/kg racemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> via the marginal ear vein within 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological indicators of sinoatrial function, including the sinus node recovery time (SNRT), corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT), total sinoatrial conduction time (TSACT) and sinus cycle length (SCL), were determined before and 20 min after medication and the changes in these indicators were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two control groups were administered 10 ml physiological saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following the administration of racemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi>, the SNRT, CSNRT, TSACT and SCL in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus node and SND groups were significantly shortened compared with those in the control groups (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological influence of racemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> on sinoatrial function in the SND group was significantly greater than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus node group (P&lt;0.01), and its effect in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> caused by a damaged sinus node was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main electrophysiological mechanism of racemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18418">higenamine</z:chebi> in the treatment of SSS was the enhancement of sinus node self-discipline and improvement of sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction function </plain></SENT>
