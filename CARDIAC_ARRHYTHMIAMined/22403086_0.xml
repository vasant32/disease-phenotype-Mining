<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the association between generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder and adverse outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 438) were recruited between 1997 and 2000 and were followed up until 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder and post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The end-point consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related readmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 198 patients had an adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder was associated with an increased rate of adverse events after adjustment for age and gender (hazard ratio: 1.94; 95% confidence interval: 1.14-3.30; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional adjustment for measures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not change the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder was associated with an almost twofold increased risk of adverse outcomes independent demographic and clinical variables and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
