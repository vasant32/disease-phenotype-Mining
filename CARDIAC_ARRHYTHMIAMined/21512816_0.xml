<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this part of a series on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> mutations in the Netherlands, we review familial idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> linked to the DPP6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> determines an intriguing subset of the inheritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes as there is no recognisable phenotype during cardiological investigation other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until recently, it was impossible to identify presymptomatic family members at risk for fatal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We uncovered several genealogically linked families affected by numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> over the past centuries, attributed to familial idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in these families was provoked by very short coupled monomorphic <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were able to associate their phenotype of lethal arrhythmic events with a haplotype harbouring the DPP6 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While this gene has not earlier been related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, we are now able, for the first time, to identify and to offer timely treatment to presymptomatic family members at risk for future fatal events solely by genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when there is a familial history of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo>, a link to the DPP6 gene may be explored as it may enable risk evaluation of the remaining family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, when closely coupled <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystoles</z:mp> initiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in the absence of other identifiable causes, a link to the DPP6 gene should be suspected </plain></SENT>
