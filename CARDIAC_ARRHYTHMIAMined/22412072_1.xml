<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several arrhythmogenic mechanisms have been inferred from animal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the translation of these hypotheses is difficult because of the lack of functional human data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the electrophysiological substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in human end-stage nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We optically mapped the coronary-perfused left ventricular wedge preparations from human hearts with end-stage nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, n=10) and nonfailing hearts (NF, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular remodeling was studied with immunostaining, Western blotting, and histological analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> prolongation of action potential duration resulting in the decrease of transmural action potential duration dispersion (64 ± 12 ms versus 129 ± 15 ms in NF, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the failing hearts, transmural activation was significantly slowed from the endocardium (39 ± 3 cm/s versus 49 ± 2 cm/s in NF, P=0.008) to the epicardium (28 ± 3 cm/s versus 40 ± 2 cm/s in NF, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conduction slowing was likely due to connexin 43 (Cx43) downregulation, decreased colocalization of Cx43 with N-cadherin (40 ± 2% versus 52 ± 5% in NF, P=0.02), and an altered distribution of phosphorylated Cx43 isoforms by the upregulation of the dephosphorylated Cx43 in both the subendocardium and subepicardium layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Failing hearts further demonstrated spatially discordant conduction velocity alternans which resulted in nonuniform propagation discontinuities and wave breaks conditioned by strands of increased interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (fibrous tissue content in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> 16.4 ± 7.7 versus 9.9 ± 1.4% in NF, P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Conduction disorder</z:e> resulting from the anisotropic downregulation of Cx43 expression, the reduction of Cx43 phosphorylation, and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is likely to be a critical component of arrhythmogenic substrate in patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
