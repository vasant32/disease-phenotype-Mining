<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although behavioral genetics research indicates that RSA is partly heritable, relatively few molecular genetics studies have been conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter promoter region (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism was associated with resting RSA among healthy young adults (N=71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers had significantly lower resting RSA than long 5-HTTLPR homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype explained 5% of the variance in resting RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although firm conclusions depend on further study, the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism may contribute to individual differences in RSA and its behavioral correlates </plain></SENT>
