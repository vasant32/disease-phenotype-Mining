<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We considered features from the RR series, as well as features computed from the ECG samples and different scales of the wavelet transform, at both available leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The classification performance and generalization were studied using publicly available databases: the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>Supraventricular Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and the St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics (INCART) databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation recommendations for class labeling and results presentation were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A floating feature selection algorithm was used to obtain the best performing and generalizing models in the training and validation sets for different search configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best model found comprehends eight features, was trained in a partition of the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and was evaluated in a completely disjoint partition of the same database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results obtained were: global accuracy of 93%; for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> beats, sensitivity (S) 95%, positive predictive value (P(+)) 98%; for supraventricular beats, S 77%, P(+) 39%; and for ventricular beats S 81%, P(+) 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In order to test the generalization capability, performance was also evaluated in the INCART, with results comparable to those obtained in the test set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This classifier model has fewer features and performs better than other state-of-the-art methods with results suggesting better generalization capability </plain></SENT>
