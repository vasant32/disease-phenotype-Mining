<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to report a single center's clinical experience validating a novel, noninvasive, whole heart, beat-by-beat, 3-dimensional mapping technology with invasive electrophysiological studies, including ablation, where applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using an electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) system in 27 patients, 3-dimensional epicardial activation maps were generated from &gt;250 body surface ECGs using heart-torso geometry obtained from computed tomographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECM activation maps were compared with clinical diagnoses, and confirmed with standard invasive electrophysiological studies mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(1) In 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo>, ECM accurately identified the ventricular insertion site of an accessory atrioventricular connection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) In 10 patients with premature ventricular complexes, ECM accurately identified their ventricular site of origin in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 of 10 patients transient premature ventricular complex suppression was observed during ablation at the site predicted by ECM as the earliest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) In 10 cases of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, ECM accurately identified the chamber of origin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10, and distinguished isthmus from nonisthmus dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) In 1 patient with sustained exercise induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, ECM accurately identified the focal origin in the left ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECM successfully provided valid activation sequence maps obtained noninvasively in a variety of rhythm disorders that correlated well with invasive electrophysiological studies </plain></SENT>
