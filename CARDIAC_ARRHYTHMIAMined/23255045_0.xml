<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Thyroid hormones affect growth, development, and metabolism of vertebrates, and are considered the major regulators of their homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, elevated circulating levels of thyroid hormones are associated with modifications in the whole organism (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and increased metabolism and temperature) and in several body regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp>, bone mass loss, and hepatobiliary complications are commonly found in hyperthyroid animals and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most thyroid hormone actions result from influences on transcription of T(3)-responsive genes, which are mediated through nuclear receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is significant evidence that tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> underlies some dysfunctions produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: During the last decades, increasing interest has been turned to the use of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> as therapeutic agents in various diseases and pathophysiological disorders believed to be mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, because elevated circulating levels of thyroid hormones are associated with tissue oxidative injury, more attention has been paid to explore the application of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> as therapeutic agents in thyroid related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At present, vitamin E is among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements due to the belief that it, as an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, may attenuate morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is due to the results of numerous scientific studies, which demonstrate that vitamin E has a primary function to destroy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25935">peroxyl radicals</z:chebi>, thus protecting <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> biological membranes from oxidative damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, results are also available indicating that protective vitamin E effects against oxidative damage can be obtained even through different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
