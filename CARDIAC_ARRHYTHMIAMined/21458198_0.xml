<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of open vs closed cell stent design on the in-hospital and 30-day outcome of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The VR collects provider-reported data on patients using a Web-based database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed both in-hospital and at 30 days postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As of October 14, 2009, there were 4337 CAS with discharge data and 2397 with 30-day data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Open cell stents (OPEN) were used in 3451 patients (79.6%), and closed cell stents (CLOSED) were used in 866 patients (20.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographics showed no differences in age, gender, race, and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the OPEN group had more patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (74.5% vs 67.4%; P = .0003) as the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The OPEN group also had a higher prevalence of preprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (25.8% vs 21.4%; P = .0079), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD; 21.0% vs 17.6%; P = .0277), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (14.7% vs 11.4%; P = .0108), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (7.4% vs 3.7%; P &lt; .0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD; 40.0% vs 35.3%; P = .0109), and smoking history (59.0% vs 54.1%; P = .0085) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are no statistically significant differences in the in-hospital or 30-day outcomes between the OPEN and CLOSED patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further subgroup analyses demonstrated symptomatic patients had a higher event rate than the asymptomatic cohort in both the OPEN and CLOSED groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among symptomatic patients, the OPEN patients had a lower (0.43% vs 1.41%; P = .0349) rate of in-hospital mortality with no difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in 30-day event rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic patients, there were also no statistically significant differences between the OPEN and CLOSED groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After risk adjustment, there remained no statistically significant differences between groups of the primary endpoint (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/MI) during in-hospital or 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In-hospital and 30-day outcomes after CAS were not significantly influenced by stent cell design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients had higher adverse event rates compared to the asymptomatic cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As there is no current evidence of differential outcome between the use of open and closed cell stents, physicians should continue to use approved stent platforms based on criteria other than stent cell design </plain></SENT>
