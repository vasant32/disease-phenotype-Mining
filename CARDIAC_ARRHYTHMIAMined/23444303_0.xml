<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the association between AF and brain function and structure in a general elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 4251 nondemented participants (mean age, 76Â±5 years) in the population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical record data were collected for the presence, subtype, and time from first diagnosis of AF; 330 participants had AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain volume measurements, adjusted for intracranial volume, and presence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were determined with magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Memory, speed of processing, and executive function composites were calculated from a cognitive test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable linear regression model, adjustments were made for demographic factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants with AF had lower total brain volume compared with those without AF (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association was stronger with persistent/permanent than paroxysmal AF and with increased time from the first diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the brain tissue volumes, AF was associated with lower volume of gray and white matter hyperintensities (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.008, respectively), but not of white matter hyperintensities (P=0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants with AF scored lower on tests of memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AF is associated with smaller brain volume, and the association is stronger with increasing burden of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that AF has a cumulative negative effect on the brain independent of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
