<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in two independent experiments (n = 5 and n = 3 independent subjects; n = 16 arrays in total, 2 for each subject) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predictive bioinformatic algorithms were employed to identify secreted proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis identified 22 gene probe sets whose expression was significantly different with a fold change (FC) greater than 5 in expression in both experiments between omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using bioinformatic predictive programs 11 of these 22 probe sets potentially coded for secreted proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathway network analysis of the secreted proteins showed that three of the proteins are part of a common pathway network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These proteins gremlin 1 (GREM1), pleiotrophin (PTN), and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) are expressed respectively 43×, 23×, and 5× in omental adipose tissue relative to subcutaneous adipose tissue as determined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of GREM1, PTN, and SLPI protein in human adipose tissue was confirmed by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three proteins are expressed in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0796154" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDYS">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</z:e> (SGBS) preadipocyte cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of GREM1, PTN, and SLPI changed with the differentiation of the preadipocytes into mature adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gene expression coupled with predictive bioinformatic algorithms have identified several genes coding for secreted proteins which are expressed differently in omental adipose tissue compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue proving a valid alternative approach to help further define the adipocyte secretome </plain></SENT>
