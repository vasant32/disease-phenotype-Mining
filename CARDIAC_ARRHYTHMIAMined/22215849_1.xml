<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial high-density maps were evaluated to understand the impact of activation direction and rate on electrogram (EGM) fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen patients (9 persistent) underwent high-density, 3-dimensional, left-atrial mapping (&gt;400 points/map) during AF, sinus (SR), and CS-paced (CSp) rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SR and CSp, fractionation was defined as an EGM with â‰¥4 deflections, although, in AF, CFE-mean &lt;80 ms was considered as continuous CFAE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anatomic distribution of CFAE sites was assessed, quantified, and correlated between rhythms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying fractionation were investigated by analysis of voltage, activation, and propagation maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minority of continuous CFAE sites displayed EGM fractionation in SR (15+/-4%) and CSp (12+/-8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EGM fractionation did not match between SR and CSp at 70+/-10% sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation maps in SR and CSp showed that wave collision (71%) and regional slow conduction (24%) caused EGM fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGM voltage during AF (0.59+/-0.58 mV) was lower than during SR and CSp (&gt;1.0 mV) at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During AF, the EGM voltage was higher at continuous CFAE sites than at non-CFAE sites (0.53 mV (Q1, Q3: 0.33 to 0.83) versus 0.30 mV (Q1, Q3: 0.18 to 0.515), P&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Global LA voltage in AF was lower in patients with persistent AF versus patients with paroxysmal AF (0.6+/-0.59 mV versus 1.12+/-1.32 mV, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of fractionated EGMs is highly variable, depending on direction and rate of activation (SR versus CSp versus AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fractionation in SR and CSp rhythms mostly resulted from wave collision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sites with continuous fractionation in AF displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> voltage in SR, suggesting absence of structural scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, many fractionated EGMs are functional in nature, and their sites dynamic </plain></SENT>
