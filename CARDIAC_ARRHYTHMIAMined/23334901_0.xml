<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) is induced to assess adequate energy required for defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are multiple parameters which influence the defibrillation safety margin (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>); however, these factors are not well-established when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are implanted for the primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in patients with severe systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated multiple clinical and echocardiographic parameters as predictors of adequate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> in patients referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation for the primary prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 41 patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation with clinical indications for the primary prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two blinded independent readers evaluated the prespecified echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included left ventricular (LV) mass, indices of right ventricular and LV systolic and diastolic functions, and LV geometric dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basic clinical demographics, including age, gender, comorbidities, and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> was established using our standard protocol for defibrillation testing which includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> with successful first shock terminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> at a value at least 10 J below the maximum output of the implanted device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High defibrillation thresholds (DFT) were defined as &gt;21 J </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age is 61.8 ± 14.7��years, with men comprising the majority of the patients (73 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only clinical variables which predicted the high DFT were age (in years) (54.5 ± 17.5 vs. 65.7 ± 11.3, p = 0.044), QRS duration (in milliseconds) (116.0 ± 29.5 vs. 110.5 ± 21.8, p = 0.03), LV mass (in grams) (241.0 ± 77.9 vs. 181.9 ± 52.3, p = 0.006), and LV mass index (in grams per square meter) (111.1 ± 38.2 vs. 86.4 ± 21.1, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression analysis, LV mass was the only independent predictor of low DFT (≤22 J) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted for the primary prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LV mass may help predict an adequate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi> in patients who are referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation for the primary prevention of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results may help distinguish the patients who may require high-energy devices prior to the implantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results may help distinguish patients requiring high-energy devices, coils, or advanced programming prior to implantation and appropriate referral to electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
