<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Twenty five GSDs, 9 backcross dogs, and 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mongrel dogs (controls) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GSDs and backcross dogs were from a research colony of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control research dogs were purchased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Action potentials (APs) and pseudo-electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded from left ventricular (LV) wedge preparations of GSDs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Midmyocardial (Mid) LV cells from GSDs and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mongrels were isolated by enzymatic digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cells were either field stimulated or voltage clamped and calcium transients were measured by confocal microscopy using the indicator Fluo-3AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of calcium handling genes was measured by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean calcium transient decay (tau) was not different between affected GSDs and control dogs, but striking cell-to-cell variability for tau was observed within affected GSDs and between affected GSDs and controls (P &lt; 0.0001 each); within-dog variability accounted for 75% of total variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Calcium sparks and afterdepolarizations occurred in GSD but not control cells. ATP2A2/SERCA2a expression was significantly reduced (P = 0.0063) in affected GSDs and inversely correlated (P = 0.0006) with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: German shepherd dogs with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> have electrophysiologic abnormalities in calcium cycling associated with reduced ATP2A2/SERCA2a expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These animals provide a unique opportunity to study calcium remodeling at the genetic and molecular level in familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
