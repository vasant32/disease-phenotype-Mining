<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the 90-day incidence of perioperative complications and mortality of patients undergoing UKA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand consecutive UKA in 828 patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review was performed to evaluate 90-day perioperative complication and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were zero <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of surgeries were complicated by variances within the 90-day postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (0.1%) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular complications were infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (0.31%), one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (0.1%), one <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (0.1%), and three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (0.31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary procedures were performed in 15 patients during the follow-up period: seven were manipulations under anesthesia for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142253" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arthrofibrosis</z:e>, one was an arthroscopic removal of retained cement, one arthroscopic removal of a drain, one repeat wound closure after a dehiscence secondary to a fall, one open reduction internal fixation for a supracondylar femur fracture, three irrigation and debridement procedures for an aseptic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, and one radical debridement with later successful conversion to a total knee arthroplasty for a periprosthetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study supports the notion that UKA is a safe procedure that is associated with a low rate of mortality and serious post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study case series </plain></SENT>
