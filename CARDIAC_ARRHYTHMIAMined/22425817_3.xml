<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Thirty-five mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory failure for whom the decision to give fluid was taken by the physician were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, tidal volume &lt;8 mL/kg, left ventricular ejection fraction&lt;50%, right ventricular dysfunction, and heart rate/respiratory rate ratio &lt;3.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Fluid challenge with 500 mL of saline over 15 mins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume variations and cardiac output obtained with a pressure recording analytic method, pulse pressure variations, and cardiac output estimated by echocardiography were recorded before and after volume expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were defined as responders if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume obtained using echocardiography increased by â‰¥15% after volume expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients responded to the fluid challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median [interquartile range, 25% to 75%] <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variation values at baseline were not different in responders and nonresponders (10% [8-16] vs. 14% [12-16]), whereas pulse pressure variations were significantly higher in responders (17% [13-19] vs. 7% [5-10]; p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A 12.6% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variations threshold discriminated between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity of 63% (95% confidence interval 38% to 84%) and a specificity of 69% (95% confidence interval 41% to 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A 10% pulse pressure variation threshold discriminated between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval 67% to 99%) and a specificity of 88% (95% confidence interval 62% to 98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was different between pulse pressure variations (0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.99) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variations (0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.76); p &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Volume expansion-induced changes in cardiac output measured using echocardiography or pressure recording analytic method were not correlated (r = 0.14; p &gt; .05) and the concordance rate of the direction of change in cardiac output was 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume variations obtained with a pressure recording analytic method cannot predict fluid responsiveness in intensive care unit patients under mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cardiac output measured by this device is not able to track changes in cardiac output induced by volume expansion </plain></SENT>
