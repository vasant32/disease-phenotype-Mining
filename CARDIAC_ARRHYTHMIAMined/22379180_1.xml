<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is the evaluation of their outcome in young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated transvenous atrial leads outcome in children and young adults from a single centre, with a retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A P&lt; 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1992 and 2008, 110 patients, 75 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> (d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>transposition of great arteries</z:mp> status/post, s/p, Mustard 41%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular septal defect</z:hpo> 11%, tetralogy 9%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> 8%), aged 13.3 ± 5.3 years, underwent PM implantation with bipolar atrial transvenous leads for sinus node dysfunction (50%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (38%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leads are steroid-eluting (98%), tined (59%), screw-in (41%), <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi>-insulated (72%), <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi>-insulated (28%), and have been positioned by transcutaneous puncture of subclavian vein into right atrial appendage/remnant (RAA, 50%), right atrial free wall/septum (25%), left atrium (s/p Mustard, 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up duration is 6.4 ± 4.8 (range 0.1-18) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, younger age at implant was a risk factor for lead failure (4 leads, 3.5%) (P= 0.03); 16 leads (14%) dislodged post-implantation and 12 were successfully repositioned, the others extracted or abandoned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dislocation occurred more frequently with screw-in leads (P= 0.03) positioned outside RAA (P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atrial threshold showed a small but significant increase, 0.002 V/month (P&lt; 0.001), impedance showed a decrease (0.6 Ω/month, P&lt; 0.001), P-wave showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous bipolar atrial leads have good long-term results in young patients, with a very low rate of lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Older age at implant can further reduce this rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lead dislodgement is frequent in the post-operative period </plain></SENT>
