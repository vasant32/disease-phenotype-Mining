<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the baseline echocardiographic characteristics and the time course and degree of recovery of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with PICMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study population consisted of 348 consecutive patients (205F/143M, 44 ± 19 y/o) with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PICMP was defined as LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt;55% in the absence of any detectable underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and improvement of LVEF ≥ 15% following treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with PCIMP underwent transthoracic echocardiography for LV size and function at 1 week and at 1-3 to 6-12 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (8F/16M, 47 ± 18 y/o) with PICMP with complete echocardiographic data were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average baseline LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic volume, LV mass index, and LVEF were 55.4 ± 6.8 mm, 69.6 ± 23.3 mL, 110.2 ± 28.3 g/m2, and 41 ± 8.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) was present in 13 (54%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early improvement (≥25% increase in LVEF at 1-week follow-up compared to baseline) was observed in 13 (54%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with early improvement had higher LVEF at 12 months of follow-up compared to patients without early improvement (58.8 ± 5.0% vs 52.5 ± 6.7%, P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PCIMP is characterized by mild-to-moderate global LV systolic dysfunction with slightly increased LV mass and mild-to-moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Greatest improvement in LV systolic dysfunction was observed at 1-week follow-up in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early improvement in LVEF may potentially predict the complete reversibility of LV systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
