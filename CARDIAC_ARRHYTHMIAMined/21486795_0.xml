<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that tissue expansions promote source-to-sink mismatch leading to early after-depolarizations (EADs) and reflection of impulses in monolayers of well-polarized neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.We traced electrical propagation optically in patterned monolayers consisting of two wide regions connected by a thin isthmus.Structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> provided a substrate for EADs, retrograde propagation along the same pathway (reflection) and reentry initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reflection always originated during the action potential (AP) plateau at the distal expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether increased <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>) would promote EADs, we employed adenoviral transfer of Nav1.5 (Ad-Nav1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with uninfected and adenoviral expression of green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP; <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> control),Ad-Nav1.5 significantly increased Nav1.5 protein expression, peak and persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> density, A Pupstroke velocity, AP duration, conduction velocity and EAD incidence, as well as reflection incidence (29.2%, n =48 vs. uninfected, 9.4%, n =64; and Ad-GFP, 4.8%, n =21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise,the persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (0.05–3 μM) prolonged the AP, leading to EADs and reflection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflection led to functional reentry distally and bigeminal and trigeminal rhythms proximally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reflection was rare in the absence of structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo>.Computer simulations demonstrated the importance of persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> in triggering reflection and predicted that the gradient between the depolarizing cells at the distal expansion and the repolarizing cells within the isthmus enabled retrograde flow of depolarizing electrotonic current to trigger EADs and reflection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of a substrate (structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) and a trigger (increased persistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> and EADs) promotes reflection and arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
