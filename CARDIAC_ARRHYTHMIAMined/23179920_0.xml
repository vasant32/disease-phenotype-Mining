<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A return electrode incorporating a thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) layer, which changes color with temperature, has been shown in sheep studies to accurately indicate underlying skin temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to validate the accuracy of TLC-coated return electrodes in indicating skin temperature in the clinical setting of cardiac radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The top layer of a standard return electrode was replaced with TLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-optic thermometer (FOT) probes were laid on the skin side of the return electrode, which was then placed on the left lateral mid-thigh of 18 patients (mean age = 61 ± 12 years, 12 men) undergoing cardiac radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Return electrode photographs were taken when FOT temperature exceeded 35 °C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TLC color changes, observed in 11 patients, were converted to temperature and compared with FOT temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TLC temperature correlated well with FOT temperature (Pearson's coefficient = 0.97 ± 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement (mean temperature difference = -0.04 ± 0.08 °C, upper limit of agreement = 0.11 ± 0.005 °C, lower limit of agreement = -0.19 ± 0.005 °C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The maximum FOT temperature recorded was 39.6 °C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no thermal injury at the return electrode site on any patients, when assessed immediately after and the day following the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TLC-coated return electrodes accurately indicate underlying skin temperature in cardiac radiofrequency ablation and may help prevent burns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This technology might be essential in high energy radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
