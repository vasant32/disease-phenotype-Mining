<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the myocardial substrate of patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), in particular in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and in the location of conduction block within the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may account for variability in response to CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New approaches, including endocardial and multisite left ventricular (LV) stimulation, may improve CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate these approaches using noncontact mapping to understand the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients (8 men and 2 women; mean [SD] age 63 [12] years; LV ejection fraction 246%; QRS duration 161 [24] ms) fulfilling conventional CRT criteria underwent an electrophysiological study, with assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response to conventional CRT as well as LV endocardial and multisite pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV activation pattern was assessed using noncontact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV endocardial pacing gave a superior <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic response compared with conventional CRT (26% versus 37% increase in LV dP/dt(max), respectively; P&lt;0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward further incremental benefit from multisite LV stimulation, although this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (71%) of patients with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> etiology or functional block responded to conventional CRT, whereas those with myocardial scar or absence of functional block often required endocardial or multisite pacing to achieve CRT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endocardial or multisite pacing may be required in certain subsets of patients undergoing CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and those with narrower QRS, in particular, may stand to benefit </plain></SENT>
