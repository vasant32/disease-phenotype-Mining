<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive, and observational study was carried out, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who were operated at the Ignacio Ch√°vez National Cardiology Institute in a 7 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We made special emphasis in postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as in the risk factors for early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We operated on 484 neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> due to total anomalous pulmonary venous conection, classic <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>transposition of great arteries</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes for early mortality were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 12.2% and was due mainly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> with 5 and 6 RACHS-1 risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for operative mortality were: age &lt; 15 days, body surface area &lt; 0.20 m2, weight &lt; 4 kg, and <z:mp ids='MP_0010432'>univentricular heart</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is still a high operative mortality for complex neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our institutional outcomes can not be extrapolated to the rest of the country, but highlights several challenges that national pediatric health care institutions and associations must assume in order to improve the attention that neonatal patients demand </plain></SENT>
