<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Channels from this family produce neuronal M currents and cardiac and auditory I(KS) currents and harbor mutations that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive functional characterization, biochemical and structural details of the interaction between CaM and the channel have remained elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that both apo-CaM and Ca(2+)/CaM bind to the C-terminal tail of the neuronal channel Kv7.4 (KCNQ4), which is involved in both hearing and mechanosensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interactions between apo-CaM and the Kv7.4 tail involve two C-terminal tail segments, known as the A and B segments, whereas the interaction between Ca(2+)/CaM and the Kv7.4 C-terminal tail requires only the B segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies show that the calcium dependence of the CaM:B segment interaction is conserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Kv7 subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>X-ray crystallographic determination of the structure of the Ca(2+)/CaM:Kv7.4 B segment complex shows that Ca(2+)/CaM wraps around the Kv7.4 B segment, which forms an Î±-helix, in an antiparallel orientation that embodies a variation of the classic 1-14 Ca(2+)/CaM interaction motif </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the context of prior studies, our data suggest a model for modulation of neuronal Kv7 channels involving a calcium-dependent conformational switch from an apo-CaM form that bridges the A and B segments to a Ca(2+)/CaM form bound to the B-helix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The structure presented here also provides a context for a number of disease-causing mutations and for further dissection of the mechanisms by which CaM controls Kv7 function </plain></SENT>
