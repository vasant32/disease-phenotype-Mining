<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined the incidence, cause, and outcomes of cardiovascular-related out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (OHCA) in individuals &lt;35 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort of OHCA in children and young adults from 1980 through 2009 was identified from the King County (Washington) Division of Emergency Medical Services' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>Cardiac Arrest</z:hpo> Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence was calculated from population census data and causes of arrest determined by review of autopsy reports and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 361 cases (26 cases 0-2 years of age, 30 cases 3-13 years of age, 60 cases 14-24 years of age, and 245 cases 25-35 years of age) of OHCA were treated by emergency medical services responders, for an overall incidence of 2.28 per 100 000 person-years (2.1 in those 0-2 years of age, 0.61 in those 3-13 years of age, 1.44 in those 14-24 years of age, and 4.40 in those 25-35 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of OHCA were congenital abnormalities in those 0 to 2 years of age (84.0%) and 3 to 13 years of age (21%), presumed primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in those 14 to 24 of age (23.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in those 25 to 35 years of age (42.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was 26.9% (3.8% in those 0-2 years of age, 40.0% in those 3-13 years of age, 36.7% in those 14-24 years of age, and 27.8% in those 25-35 years of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival increased throughout the study period from 13.0% in 1980 to 1989 to 40.2% in 2000 to 2009 (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of OHCA in children and young adults is higher than previously reported, and a more specific understanding of the causes should guide future prevention programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival trends support contemporary resuscitation protocols for OHCA in the young </plain></SENT>
