<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the contributing electrophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Left ventricular (LV) monophasic action potential duration (APD(90)) and effective refractory periods were determined in perfused guinea-pig hearts along with volume-conducted ECG recordings during epicardial and endocardial stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Consistent with electrotonic modulation of repolarization, APD(90) at a given (either epicardial or endocardial) recording site tended to be longer while pacing from the ipsilateral LV site as compared to stimulations applied at the opposite side of ventricular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, the intrinsic transmural repolarization gradient was amplified during endocardial pacing while being significantly reduced upon epicardial stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum slope of APD(90) restitution was greater upon endocardial than epicardial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The excitability was found to recur at earlier repolarization time point at endocardium than epicardium, thereby contributing to increased endocardial critical intervals for re-excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Premature extrasystolic beats could have been elicited at shorter coupling stimulation intervals and propagated with greater transmural conduction delay upon endocardial than epicardial stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endocardial site exhibited lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> thresholds and greater inducibility of tachyarrhythmia upon extrasystolic stimulations as compared to epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arrhythmic susceptibility in guinea-pig heart is greater during endocardial than epicardial pacing because of greater transmural APD(90) dispersion, steeper electrical restitution slopes, greater critical intervals for LV re-excitation and slower transmural conduction of the earliest premature ectopic beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to determine whether these effects may contribute to proarrhythmia in paced human patients </plain></SENT>
