<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> is a life-threatening protein misfolding disease and affects cardiac tissue, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amyloid deposits result in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the role of innate defense components, i.e., Deleted in Malignant <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>Brain Tumors</z:mp> 1 (DMBT1) and the complement system, in different types of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of DMBT1 and of the complement proteins C1q, C3d and C4d in cardiac specimens of patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> were determined by immunohistochemistry and correlated with amyloid deposits stained by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34653">Congo red</z:chebi> dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strong DMBT1 staining adjacent to amyloid deposits was detected in different <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> types, depending on the extent of the deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DMBT1 is localized in the endomysium and perimysium, in the endocardium, in the myocytes and in endothelial cells of affected transmural vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C1q, C3d and C4d were detected in the amyloid deposits but also in the endomysium and perimysium, in some myocytes, in endothelial cells, in the endocardium, and around the amyloid deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulated DMBT1 and complement activation in cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> may be part of the activated pathways induced by protein aggregation and the consecutive inflammatory reaction </plain></SENT>
