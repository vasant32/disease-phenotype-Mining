<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of these studies was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin, a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> co-transporter-2 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of T2DM, and four medications commonly prescribed in patients with T2DM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, and digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Potential pharmacokinetic interactions between 20 mg dapagliflozin, 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, or 320 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> were assessed in an open-label, randomized, five-period, five-treatment, unbalanced crossover study in 24 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second study, the effects of steady-state dapagliflozin on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or 0.25 mg digoxin were assessed in an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment crossover study in 30 healthy subjects divided into two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential pharmacodynamic interaction between dapagliflozin and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> had any clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin increased the area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> acid, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> by approximately 19%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, and decreased the maximum observed plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> by approximately 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects were not considered clinically meaningful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, dapagliflozin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either digoxin or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pharmacodynamics of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were also unaffected by dapagliflozin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In these studies the co-administration of dapagliflozin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, or digoxin was well tolerated without clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction </plain></SENT>
