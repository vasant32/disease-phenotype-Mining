<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred and one patients were included in the study who underwent electrophysiological study for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraatrial conduction times were measured from intracardiac electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atrial conduction times were also measured by tissue Doppler echocardiography by evaluating atrial electromechanical delay between lateral mitral annulus, septal mitral annulus, and right ventricular tricuspid annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between electrophysiological and echocardiographic atrial conduction times were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a weak correlation between the measurements of interatrial conduction times with the electrophysiological and tissue Doppler techniques (r = 0.308; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation for intraleft atrial conduction times was moderate (r = 0.652; p ã€ˆ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the measurements of intra-right atrial conduction times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that tissue Doppler echocardiography can be used for the measurement of interatrial and intra-left atrial conduction times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler echocardiography can be a suitable technique to evaluate atrial substrate </plain></SENT>
