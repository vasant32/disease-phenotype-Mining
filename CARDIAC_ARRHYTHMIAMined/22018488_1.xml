<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CArdiac Resynchronization-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> study, which tested the pure effect of CRT (using CRT devices without the capability of defibrillation) clearly showed a significant reduction in the total mortality by partly preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic effects of CRT are explained, at least in part, by ionic and genetic modulation of ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been revealed in animal experiments to mimic disorganized ventricular contraction that CRT reverses down-regulation of certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels and abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, CRT can be proarrhythmic in some particular cases especially in the early phase of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to our study, proarrhythmic effects after CRT can be observed in approximately 10% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively high incidence of the proarrhythmic effects of CRT may promote a trend toward selecting CRT-D rather than CRT-P </plain></SENT>
