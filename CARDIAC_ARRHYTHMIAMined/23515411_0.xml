<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This phase I study was conducted to identify the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of alvocidib when combined with vorinostat in patients with relapsed, refractory, or poor prognosis <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives included investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received vorinostat (200 mg orally, three times a day, for 14 days) on a 21-day cycle, combined with 2 different alvocidib administration schedules: a 1-hour intravenous infusion, daily × 5; or a 30-minute loading infusion followed by a 4-hour maintenance infusion, weekly × 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The alvocidib dose was escalated using a standard 3+3 design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alvocidib MTD was 20 mg/m(2) (30-minute loading infusion) followed by 20 mg/m(2) (4-hour maintenance infusion) on days one and eight, in combination with vorinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered toxicities were cytopenias, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002148'>hypophosphatemia</z:hpo>, and QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No objective responses were achieved although 13 of 26 evaluable patients exhibited stable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alvocidib seemed to alter vorinostat pharmacokinetics, whereas alvocidib pharmacokinetics were unaffected by vorinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo exposure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells to plasma obtained from patients after alvocidib treatment blocked vorinostat-mediated p21(CIP1) induction and downregulated Mcl-1 and p-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> Pol II for some specimens, although parallel in vivo bone marrow responses were infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Alvocidib combined with vorinostat is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although disease stabilization occurred in some heavily pretreated patients, objective responses were not obtained with these schedules </plain></SENT>
