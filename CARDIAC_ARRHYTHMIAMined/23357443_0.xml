<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: How best to capture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) using biomarkers has been elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated whether emotion reactivity and regulation provide a means to achieve this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were classified into three groups: children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> plus low prosocial behavior (hypothesized to be high in callous/unemotional traits; n = 21); children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> with age-appropriate prosocial behavior (n = 54); and typically developing children (n = 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children completed a task with four conditions: negative induction, negative suppression, positive induction, and positive suppression of affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The task required children to view an emotion-laden film clip, while either facially mimicking (induction) or masking (suppression) the emotion of the main character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parasympathetic and sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity were assessed via respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, conduct, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010865'>oppositional defiant disorders</z:hpo> were treated as covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>-typical-prosocial group displayed atypically elevated parasympathetic reactivity (emotion dysregulation) during positive induction, along with increased sympathetic activity (elevated arousal) across conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>-low-prosocial group displayed reduced parasympathetic reactivity and reduced sympathetic activity (low emotional arousal) across baseline and task conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> groups had altered patterns of autonomic functioning, but in two distinct forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> clinically, results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> is also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with regard to physiological indices of emotion and regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies of emotion, regulation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> should take this into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further study of physiological responding in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> may yield clinically and etiologically distinct domains or groups </plain></SENT>
