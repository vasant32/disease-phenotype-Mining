<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is sometimes complicated by elevated pacing thresholds and phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS), both of which may require that the coronary sinus lead be repositioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a novel quadripolar electrode lead and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) device that enables electrical repositioning, potentially obviating a lead reposition procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients indicated for CRT were enrolled and received a quadripolar electrode lead and CRT-D device (Quartetmodel 1458Q and Promote Q; St Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical data, and the presence of PNS during pacing from each left ventricular (LV) configuration, were documented at pre-hospital discharge and at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients were enrolled and 71 were successfully implanted with a Quartetlead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrical measurements were stable over the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven per cent (64 of 66) of patients had one or more programmable configurations with a threshold &lt; 2.5 V and no PNS vs. 86% (57 of 66) if only conventional bipolar configurations were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physicians were able to use the increased programming options to manage threshold changes and PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new quadripolar electrode LV lead provides more programming options to address common problems faced when managing CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrical measurements from new vectors are comparable with conventional configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 11% of patients in the study suffered PNS on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conventional bipolar vectors </plain></SENT>
