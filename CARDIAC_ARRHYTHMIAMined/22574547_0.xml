<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography (ECG) has been routinely performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in CCU and ICCU in Siriraj Hospital everyday in the morning until discharge for screening the abnormalities, such as ischemic changes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the occurrence of ECG changes from everyday recording is not common and the real incidence has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is uncertainty regarding the benefit derived, when weighted with the cost and the time wasted from the routine everyday ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> that can be detected and have the effects on treatment from the routine everyday ECG in the patients admitted in CCU and ICCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred and ten patients, admitted in CCU/ICCU in Siriraj Hospital were consecutively enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routine everyday 12 leads ECG was performed in the morning in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG was interpreted by 2 cardiologists for the incidence and detail of ECG changes as compared to prior ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the incidence of those changes that affected management was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease spectra and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ECG changes were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECG changes from routine everyday ECG was 52.7%, however 25.9% of these changes could be detected by telemetry recorded in every CCU/ICCU patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ECG changes which affected treatment were 20%, whereas 36.4% of them could be detected by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence was more pronounced in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and found mostly within the first 4 days of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: While ECG changes from routine everyday ECG occurred in half of the CCU/ICCU patients, one-fourth could be detected by the telemetry recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ECG changes that affected treatment were much lower and found merely in one-fifth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This incidence could lead to the limitation of every routine ECG to only high-risk patients during the high-risk period </plain></SENT>
