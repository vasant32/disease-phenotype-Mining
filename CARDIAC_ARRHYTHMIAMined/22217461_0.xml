<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in its various stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A longitudinal, descriptive, observational study was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Intensive care units of two university hospitals in Bogot√° (Colombia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A number of patients consecutively admitted to the adult ICU with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and no evidence of previous ischemic myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Forty-eight hours of electrocardiographic record using Holter technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN VARIABLES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were analyzed, 62% being staged as presenting septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three percent suffered ischemic events detected by Holter and unnoticed through conventional monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent suffered an arrhythmic event detected by Holter, compared with only 6% as detected by conventional monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed loss of heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> showed a low incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, arrhythmic events showed a high incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conventional monitoring failed to detect any of the ischemic events and most arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study, cardiovascular events generated by adrenergic discharge had no impact upon mortality </plain></SENT>
