<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> worldwide, and it is associated with an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that at least 90Â % of left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> discovered in patients with AF are localized to the left atrial appendage (LAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical ligation or excision of the LAA is considered the standard of care in patients who undergo mitral valve surgery or as an adjunct to a surgical Maze procedure for treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, in selected patients with AF and an elevated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, particularly in those with contraindication to oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy, it is reasonable to consider LAA exclusion to offer protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and other embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This can be achieved through a number of different strategies, including surgical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> or ligation of the LAA, percutaneous endocardial occlusion of the LAA by deployment of occlusive devices, and also ligation of the LAA via a closed-chest, percutaneous, epicardial catheter-based approach in select patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although results from several recent percutaneous LAA closure and ligation studies are highly promising, the evidence for long-term efficacy and safety is insufficient to presently recommend this approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients other than those in whom long-term OAC is contraindicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future randomized studies are required to further address the long-term safety and efficacy of these therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the role for LAA occlusion and ligation seems less clear in patients who undergo successful catheter ablation of AF, since at least in a subgroup of these patients antiplatelet therapy alone has been shown to be sufficient </plain></SENT>
