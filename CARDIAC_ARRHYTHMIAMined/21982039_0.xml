<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) has traditionally been considered to be "balanced" between continuously interacting sympathetic and parasympathetic outflows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess ANS control of the heart during prolonged coronary balloon occlusion procedures of one of the major coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: R-R intervals were obtained from continuous electrocardiographic data of 90 patients undergoing selective percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with balloon inflation periods ranging from 3 to 10 minutes (4.7 ± 1.1 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three 3-minute stages were chosen: (1) preinflation (baseline), (2) from the start of occlusion (PCI), and (3) immediately post deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of the ANS was evaluated by heart rate variability analysis using standard time and frequency domain indices and the short-term fractal-like index (α(1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During PCI, time and frequency domain measures related to vagal control decreased significantly with respect to baseline (significantly in left anterior descending [LAD] <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the postdeflation stage, heart rate variability and high-frequency power increased (P &lt; .01) in the group with right coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, whereas a marked sympathetic increase, as assessed by an increase (P &lt; .01) of normalized low-frequency power and the low/high-frequency ratio was observed in the LAD group after balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fractal index α(1) decreased during the PCI period but increased significantly after balloon deflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in autonomic control of heart rate that were a function of the affected artery occurred during and after coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the LAD resulted in a significant reduction of vagal activity and a decrease of the short-term fractal index during PCI and a marked sympathetic response after postdeflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a marked increment of vagal activity between the occlusion stage and postdeflation period was found in the right coronary artery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results may relate the site of the occlusion and lack of blood supply to different parts of the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
