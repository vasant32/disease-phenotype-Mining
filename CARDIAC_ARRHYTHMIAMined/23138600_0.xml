<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Totally percutaneous endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (PEVAR) by using the "Preclose" technique has been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed data, collected prospectively at our institution, regarding PEVAR via femoral artery access with local anesthesia and conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2001 and May 2009, 1150 patients underwent PEVAR in the endovascular suite of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those procedures, 915 (79%) were performed with local anesthesia and conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients were male (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 72±10 years, and 98% had a risk status of American Society of Anesthesiologists class III or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PEVAR involved bilateral percutaneous femoral access with 12F to 24F sheaths (depending on the stent-graft system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean total procedure time was 149 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous closure of the arterial access sites with the Prostar XL was successful in 1727 (94.3%) of the 1830 femoral arteries in which PEVAR was attempted, whereas 103 femoral arteries (5.6%) required surgical repair because adequate hemostasis was not attained at the access site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, but 6 patients (0.6%) died within 30 days of the procedure: 3 died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156149" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ischemia</z:e>, 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and 1 of worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean length of hospital stay was 1.3±2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PEVAR with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation is safe and feasible and should be considered for patients for whom general anesthesia poses a high risk </plain></SENT>
