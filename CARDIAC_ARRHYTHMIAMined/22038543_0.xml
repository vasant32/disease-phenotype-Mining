<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (MD1) is a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disease with variable penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac conduction disturbances are frequent and may be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, but its progression was heretofore unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of the study was to analyse the natural history of infrahissian conduction time in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> first electrophysiological test, and to identify the predictive value of the clinical and ECG factors accompanying an alteration of infrahissian conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 127 consecutive screened MD patients, 25 were enrolled and underwent a second electrophysiological testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second electrophysiological test was carried out on patients showing new symptoms, new atrioventricular conduction disturbances on ECG, or significant modifications of signal-averaged (SA)-ECG, and on asymptomatic patients with a follow-up of at least 60 months since the first electrophysiological test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 25 patients, four had new clinical symptoms, four others developed new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1373225" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrioventricular conduction abnormalities</z:e> on ECG and six had significant modifications of the SA-ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean His-ventricle (HV) interval increased significantly between the two electrophysiological studies (initial HV interval 52.1 ms±1.6 ms, final HV interval 61.4 ms±2.2 ms, p&lt;0.005), with a mean increase of 1.2 ms/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The five patients with HV interval of 70 ms or greater were implanted with a prophylactic dual-chamber pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Modifications of resting ECG and SA-ECG were strongly associated with HV interval prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial electrophysiological study, modifications on the resting ECG and/or SA-ECG, on annual check-up, were associated with an alteration of infrahissian conduction </plain></SENT>
