<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Long-term complications of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> drug overdosing have not been adequately investigated in infants and young children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite reports discouraging their use in children, these formulations are frequently administered for "cold-like symptoms" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their frequent adverse events are different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011701'>multifocal atrial tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 3-year-old toddler developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011701'>multifocal atrial tachycardia</z:hpo> following an iatrogenic overdose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> accidentally administered intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His ECG showed wandering atrial pacemaker (p-waves with different origins and configurations) that persisted for at least one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This event demonstrated the sensitivity of young children to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> drugs, especially overdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers and parents should be warned of toxicities associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> drug overdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to determine whether wandering atrial pacemaker is a potential long-term complication of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
