<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: There is increasing evidence of the role direction-dependent conduction plays in the arrhythmogenic interaction between ectopic triggers and abnormal atrial substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We thus sought to characterize direction-dependent conduction in chronically stretched atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial stretch due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and 24 reference patients with left-sided accessory pathways were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multipolar catheters placed at the lateral right atrium, crista terminalis, and coronary sinus (CS) characterized direction-dependent conduction along linear catheters and across the crista terminalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bi-atrial electroanatomic maps were created in both sinus rhythm and an alternative wavefront direction by pacing from the distal CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allowed an assessment of conduction velocities, electrogram, and voltage characteristics during wavefronts propagating in different directions. Â While differing wavefront directions caused changes in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial stretch and reference patients (P&lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), these direction-dependent changes were greater in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial stretch compared with reference patients, who exhibited greater slowing in conduction velocities (P= 0.09), prolongation of bi-atrial activation time (P= 0.04), increase in number (P&lt; 0.001) and length (P&lt; 0.001) of lines of conduction block, increase in fractionated electrograms (P&lt; 0.001), and decrease in voltage (P= 0.08) during left-to-right compared with right-to-left atrial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These direction-dependent changes were associated with a greater propensity for chronically stretched atria to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P= 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial remodelling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial stretch exacerbates physiological direction-dependent conduction characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the greater direction-dependent conduction seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> atrial stretch may promote arrhythmogenesis due to ectopic triggers from the left atrium </plain></SENT>
