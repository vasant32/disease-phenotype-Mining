<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop diagnostic criteria for the short QT syndrome (SQTS) to facilitate clinical evaluation of suspected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The SQTS is a cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten years after its original description, a consensus regarding an appropriate QT interval cutoff and specific diagnostic criteria have yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported cases of SQTS in the English language, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant data were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of QT intervals and electrocardiographic (ECG) features in affected cases were analyzed and compared to data derived from ECG analysis from general population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 61 reported cases of SQTS were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Index events, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurred in 35 of 61 (57.4%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cohort was predominantly male (75.4%) and had a mean QT(c) value of 306.7 ms with values ranging from 248 to 381 ms in symptomatic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In reference to the ECG characteristics of the general population, and in consideration of clinical presentation, family history, and genetic findings, a highly sensitive diagnostic scoring system was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on a comprehensive review of 61 reported cases of the SQTS, formal diagnostic criteria have been proposed that will facilitate diagnostic evaluation in suspected cases of SQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria may lead to a greater recognition of this condition and provoke screening of at-risk family members </plain></SENT>
