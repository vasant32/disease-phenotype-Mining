<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate the yield of cardiogenetic screening of relatives of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) and sudden unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (SUD) victims in a population-based setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A population-based study was carried out between 2000 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records of the hospital, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> declaration certificates, and resuscitation records were reviewed for SCD and SUD cases (1-40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on autopsy results and cardiogenetic screening of the victims' first-degree relatives was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relatives were invited for additional cardiogenetic screening when this had not yet been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The search led to 16 cases of SCD/SUD and 4 cases of aborted SCD/SUD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Causes of SCD/SUD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> (n = 1), and unknown cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Causes of aborted SCD/SUD were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 2), idiopatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 1), and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cardiogenetic screening of 37 relatives of 12 victims led to a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> in 3 relatives and the suspicion of ARVC in 2 relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The yield of screening of these relatives was 14% (95% confidence interval: 3-25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the usual care, relatives of (aborted) SCD and SUD victims are often not referred for cardiogenetic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Screening is often not performed according to a systematic approach, and the detection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> in relatives of (aborted) SCD and SUD victims in a population-based setting, although substantial, is lower than expected based on previous studies </plain></SENT>
