<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence demonstrates that hereditary defects are involved in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is of remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and the heritable components responsible for AF in the majority of patients remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the entire coding region of the GATA6 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor crucial for cardiogenesis, was sequenced in 138 unrelated patients with lone AF, and a novel heterozygous GATA6 mutation, c.704A &gt; C equivalent to p.Y235S, was identified in a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detected substitution, which altered the amino acid highly conserved evolutionarily across species, was absent in 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals, and was predicted to be disease-causing by MutationTaster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of the available relatives of the mutation carrier showed that in the family the variation co-segregated with the disease transmitted as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait, with complete penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional analysis performed using a luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the mutant GATA6 protein resulted in significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide novel insight into the molecular pathophysiology implicated in AF, suggesting the potential implications in the prophylactic strategy and effective therapy for this common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
