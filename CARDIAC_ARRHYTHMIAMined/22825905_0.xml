<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the electrophysiological characteristics of systolic (SP) and diastolic (DP) potentials recorded during sinus rhythm (SR) in the left interventricular septum of a 27 year-old woman presenting with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>-sensitive idiopathic left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During SR, and during VT, SP was activated from ventricular base-to-apex, and DP from apex-to-base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SP and DP were both detected at the site of successful ablation during SR, whereas during VT, DP was detected away from the earliest activation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, SP apparently reflected a critical component of the reentrant circuit, while DP reflected the activation of a bystander pathway </plain></SENT>
