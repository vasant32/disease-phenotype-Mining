<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In a population-based cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Olmsted County residents who underwent a THA or TKA (1994-2008), we assessed 90-day occurrence and predictors of cardiac complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>), thromboembolic complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 90-day complication rates after THA and TKA were: cardiac, 6.9% and 6.7%; thromboembolic, 4.0% and 4.9%; and mortality, 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analyses, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class III-IV (OR 6.1, 95% CI:1.6-22.8) and higher Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score (OR 1.2, 95% CI:1.0-1.4) were significantly associated with odds of 90-day cardiac event post-THA in patients with no known previous cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those with known previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class III-IV (OR 4.4, 95% CI:2.0-9.9), male gender (OR 0.5, 95% CI:0.3-0.9) and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> (OR 3.2; 95% CI:1.4-7.0) were significantly associated with odds of cardiac complication 90 days post-THA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were found in THA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In TKA patients with no previous cardiac history, age &gt;65 years (OR 4.1, 95% CI:1.2-14.0) and in TKA patients with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class III-IV (OR 3.2, 95% CI:1.8-5.7) was significantly associated with odds of 90-day cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In TKA patients with no previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, male gender (OR 0.5, 95% CI:0.2-0.9) and higher Charlson index (OR 1.2, 95% CI:1.1-1.3) and in patients with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo>, higher Charlson index score (OR 1.2, 95% CI:1.1-1.4) was associated with odds of 90-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Older age, higher comorbidity, higher <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> class and previous history of cardiac/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> were associated with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
