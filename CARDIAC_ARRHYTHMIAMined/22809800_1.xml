<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cardiac safety of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system stimulants in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population based retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Automated healthcare claims data from 1,219,847 children and young people eligible for 28 state Medicaid programmes from 1999 to 2006 linked to the Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Master File and the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Children and young people age 3-18 entered the cohort at the first diagnosis of a mental health condition commonly treated with stimulants (such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder) after a minimum period of six months' eligibility and were followed until loss of eligibility, their 19th birthday, admission to hospital for longer than 30 days, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included transplant recipients, receipt of dialysis, or claims indicating substance misuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We retained high risk groups with similar use of stimulants as low risk children (such as children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic characteristics, cardiac risk factors, and psychiatric diagnoses obtained from before the index period were summarised with a propensity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We used discrete survival analysis to estimate the relative risk for periods of stimulant use and non-use, adjusted for propensity score and antipsychotic use for the full cohort and the high risk and low risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>; a secondary composite endpoint added <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> RESULTS: A total of 66 (95 including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>) events occurred during 2,321,311 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio adjusted for propensity score and antipsychotic use for current versus no stimulant use was 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.27 to 1.44), with a corresponding adjusted incidence rate of 2.2 and 3.5 per 100,000 patient years for current stimulant and non-use, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty six events occurred in high risk patients (incidence rate 63 per 100,000 patient years) with an odds ratio of 1.02 (0.28 to 3.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for the secondary endpoint were similar to those for the primary endpoint (0.74, 0.38 to 1.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of children with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> stimulants is not significantly associated with an increase in the short term risk of severe cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analyses cannot be generalised to children with long term use of stimulants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, long term effects of slight increases in heart rate or blood pressure are unknown </plain></SENT>
