<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The direct role of coronary vessels in defibrillation, although hypothesized to be important, remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated how vessel-induced virtual electrode polarizations assist reentry termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A highly anatomically detailed rabbit ventricular slice bidomain computer model was constructed from 25-μm magnetic resonance data, faithfully representing both structural and electric properties of blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, an equivalent simplified model with intramural cavities filled in was also built </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> induction, 6 initial states were selected, and biphasic shocks (5-70 V) were applied using a realistic implanted cardioverter-defibrillator electrode configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fundamental mechanism of biphasic defibrillation was uncovered in both models, involving successive break excitations (after each shock phase) emanating from opposing myocardial surfaces (in septum and left ventricle), which rapidly closed down excitable gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of vessels accelerated this process, achieving more-rapid and successful defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Defibrillation failed in 5 cases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> because of initiation of new activity) compared with 8 with the simplified model (5/8 failures because of surviving activity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At stronger shocks, virtual electrodes formed around vessels, rapidly activating intramural tissue because of break excitations, assisting the main defibrillation mechanism, and eliminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> activity &lt;15 ms of shock end in 60% of successful shocks (36% in simplified model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis identified that only vessels &gt;200 μm in diameter participated through this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, wavefronts could survive intramurally in the simplified model, leading to reentry and shock failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We provide new insight into defibrillation mechanisms by showing how intramural blood vessels facilitate more-effective elimination of existing wavefronts, rapid closing down of excitable gaps, and successful defibrillation and give guidance toward the required resolution of cardiac imaging and model generation endeavors for mechanistic defibrillation analysis </plain></SENT>
