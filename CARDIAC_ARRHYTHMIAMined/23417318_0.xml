<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Sympathetic activation induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) excludes respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) associated with inspiratory flow limitation without oxygen desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether RERAs are associated with sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five adults (12 males, 13 females) with AHI &lt; 10/h and RERA index &gt;5/h were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Power spectral density analysis was performed on two non-contiguous 10-min segments containing inspiratory flow limitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free electrocardiogram during N2 sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One segment contained RERA; the other did not, NO-RERA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectral power was described in a low-frequency domain (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), primarily sympathetic modulation, and a high frequency domain (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz), parasympathetic modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses of LF and HF powers were made using normalized and absolute values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LF power was greater during RERA compared to NO-RERA (50.3 vs. 30.1 %, p &lt; 0.001) whereas HF power was greater during NO-RERA compared to RERA (69.9 vs. 49.7 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LF/HF ratio was greater during RERA than NO-RERA (1.01 vs. 0.43, p &lt;��0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gender differences emerged using absolute values of power: The percentage increase in LF power during RERA relative to NO-RERA was significantly greater for females than males, 247.6 vs. 31.9 %, respectively (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RERAs are associated with a marked increase in cardiac sympathetic modulation, especially in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with a high RERA index, even in the setting of a low or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> AHI, may be exposed to elevated sympathetic tone during sleep </plain></SENT>
