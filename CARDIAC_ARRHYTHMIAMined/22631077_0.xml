<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:   Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> represent significant morbidity and risk for mortality in Fontan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomized trial involving patients undergoing a lateral tunnel Fontan between 1999 and 2001, Collins et al. investigated the safety and efficacy of a surgical atrial incision aimed at decreasing the incidence of intraatrial reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (IART) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to report the late follow-up of the aforementioned trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN:   <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients previously enrolled in the randomized trial were eligible for this follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' legal guardians were contacted for informed consent and data were obtained form a retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Of the 39 eligible patients, 29 were recruited: 15 in the intervention and 14 in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow was 9.0 (1.2) years for the intervention group and 9.3 (1.1) years for the control group (P= .86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At most recent follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the demographic, echocardiographic, and electrophysiological data between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no late incidence of the primary outcome, IART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were nine cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> sinus node dysfunction (SND): 5/15 in the intervention and 4/14 in the control groups (P= .99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was only one late pacemaker implantation for early post-op SND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   At late follow-up 9 years post-Fontan, IART had not occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> complications related to the interventional atrial incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up is warranted for this cohort </plain></SENT>
