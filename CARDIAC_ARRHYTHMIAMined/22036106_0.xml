<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although increasingly diagnosed, data on the outcomes are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To define the predictors of adverse outcomes, we performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively defined cohort of consecutive patients (age &gt;14 years) diagnosed with left ventricular noncompaction at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics included presentation with a cardiovascular complication (i.e., decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, systemic embolic event, or sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was survival free from cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictors of survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 115 patients were included, 77% of whom were symptomatic at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the asymptomatic patients, the symptomatic patients were significantly older and had larger left ventricular cavities and worse left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 115 patients, 49 (43%) presented with a cardiovascular complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 2.7 years (range 0.1 to 19.4), none of the asymptomatic patients died or underwent transplantation compared to 31% (27 of 88) of the symptomatic patients (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The major determinants of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplantation were presentation with a cardiovascular complication (hazard ratio 20.6, 95% confidence interval 4.9 to 87.5, p &lt;0.0001) or New York Heart Association class III or greater (hazard ratio 8.8, 95% confidence interval 3.2 to 24.0, p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002753'>Left ventricular dilation</z:mp> and systolic dysfunction were less strong predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with left ventricular noncompaction, New York Heart Association class III or greater and cardiovascular complications at presentation are strong predictors for adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
