<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, growing evidence suggests an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA), a common sleep breathing disorder which is increasing in prevalence as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic surges, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF is a costly public health problem increasing a patient's risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether the association is based on mutual risk factors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, or whether OSA is an independent risk factor and causative in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper explores the pathophysiology of OSA which may predispose to AF, clinical implications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in this cohort who display overlapping disease processes, and targeted treatment strategies such as continuous positive airway pressure and AF ablation </plain></SENT>
