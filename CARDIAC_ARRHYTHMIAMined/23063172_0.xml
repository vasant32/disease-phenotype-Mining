<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation for incessant and symptomatic premature ventricular complex (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) localized in a left papillary muscle is uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3D mapping and cardiac MRI may be useful to achieve ablation success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: A fifty-four-years-old man was referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His medical history included placement of a right coronary artery stent six years before and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ejection fraction (EF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Holter monitoring under beta-blocker therapy (46% <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) and ECG showed monomorphic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, positive concordance with V5 transition and a superior axis, with no R/T phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During two separate electrophysiologic procedures (recurrence), a 3D mapping (Velocity, ST-Jude Medicalâ„¢) system was used combined with an irrigated tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The earliest site of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> activation documented with the mapping system was near the posterior papillary muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pace mapping in this area showed nearly 90% concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 2126 seconds of radiofrequency applications, there were no more <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and no inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Post procedure cardiac MRI showed scar in the inferior-lateral area of the left ventricle including a section of the posterior papillary muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scar included 50% of the thickness of the wall (previous 2005 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and radiofrequency lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Residual EF was 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 2 months of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with only 53 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> on 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient was maintained under beta-blocker therapy for his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At six-month follow-up, he is still asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case report stresses the role of cardiac MRI and 3D cartography systems for successful treatment of papillary muscle <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> associated with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which still represent a therapeutic challenge </plain></SENT>
