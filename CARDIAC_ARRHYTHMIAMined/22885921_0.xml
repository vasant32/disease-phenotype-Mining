<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) refers to a clinically lacking cardiovascular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> generating the pathophysiologic substrate for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because idiopathic AF is associated with an increased event rate, it could be a harbinger of as-yet undetected underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) in patients diagnosed with idiopathic paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 3243 patients who underwent cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in our center between January 2008 and March 2011, we identified a total of 115 consecutive idiopathic paroxysmal AF patients who underwent CTA before electrophysiologic ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were compared with 275 age-, sex-, and PROCAM risk score-matched healthy controls in permanent sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, previous known coronary artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, thyroid, pulmonary, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, and structural abnormalities on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Controls more often showed a family history of CAD (38% vs 15%, P &lt;.001), had a higher prevalence of smoking (25% vs 14%, P = .021), higher fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (5.5 ± 0.7 mmol/L vs 5.4 ± 0.6 mmol/L, P = .025), and smaller atrial diameters (37 ± 4 mm vs 40 ± 5 mm, P &lt;.001) compared to AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notwithstanding the above, idiopathic AF patients significantly more often suffered from subclinical CAD compared to controls (49% vs 34%, P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression analysis revealed that beside (as expected) age and gender, a history of AF and left atrial diameter were significant predictors of underlying CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Half of patients originally diagnosed with idiopathic paroxysmal AF show concealed underlying CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The detection and treatment of CAD at an early stage could improve the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
