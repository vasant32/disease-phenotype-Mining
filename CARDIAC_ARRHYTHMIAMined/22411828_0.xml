<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hereditary mutations of ankyrins are known to be associated with diseases including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> in humans, although the underlying molecular bases are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle spectrin-binding domain of ankyrins contains highly conserved ZU5-ZU5-UPA-DD domains arranged into the ZZUD tandem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Curiously, most of the disease-causing mutations in the tandem have no apparent impact on the spectrin binding of ankyrins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high resolution structure of the ankyrin-B ZZUD tandem determined here reveals that the ZU5-ZU5-UPA domains form a tightly packed structural supramodule, whereas DD is freely accessible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the formation of the ZZU supramodule does not influence the spectrin binding of ankyrins, mutations altering the interdomain interfaces of ZZU impair the functions of ankyrin-B&amp;G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our structural analysis further indicates that the ZZU supramodule of ankyrins has two additional surfaces that may bind to targets other than spectrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the structure of the ankyrin ZZUD provides mechanistic explanations to many disease-causing mutations identified in ankyrin-B&amp;R </plain></SENT>
