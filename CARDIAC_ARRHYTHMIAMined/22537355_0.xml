<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of cTn screening in the pediatric population is less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current clinical practice, diagnostic and prognostic value, and resource utilization associated with cTn assays in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multicenter, retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cTn assays performed on patients aged â‰¤18 years from January 2003 to December 2010 in the Intermountain Healthcare system was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collected included patient demographics, location, presenting symptoms, provisional and discharge diagnoses, additional tests, clinical outcomes (hospitalization days, ventilation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>), and patient charges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the study period, cTn assays were performed on 3,497 pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> (40%), trauma (11%), and poisoning or drug overdose (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Irrespective of diagnosis, elevated cTn was associated with an increased rate of hospitalization, ventilation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 12% of patients had elevated cTn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, 4% had elevated cTn, 53% of whom were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myopericarditis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myopericarditis</z:e> group, 66% presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and 98% had abnormal electrocardiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, approximately $162,000 was spent per positive result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cTn screening has strong prognostic value in pediatric patients, even in noncardiac diagnoses such as trauma or drug overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, cTn screening in pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> provides minimal benefits and is associated with increased resource utilization, unless patients have constitutional symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
