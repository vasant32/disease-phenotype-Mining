<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi>), a subfamily of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that are incapable of functioning as growth factors, are intracellular modulators of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels and have been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi> have been found in embryonic heart, they have not been reported in adult heart, and they have not been shown to regulate endogenous cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels or to participate in cardiac pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi> regulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels in murine heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that isoforms of FGF13 are the predominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi> in adult mouse ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FGF13 binds directly to, and colocalizes with, the Na(V)1.5 Na(+) channel in the sarcolemma of adult mouse ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of FGF13 in adult mouse ventricular myocytes revealed a loss of function of Na(V)1.5-reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current density, decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel availability, and slowed Na(V)1.5-reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current recovery from inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell surface biotinylation experiments showed â‰ˆ45% reduction in Na(V)1.5 protein at the sarcolemma after FGF13 knockdown, whereas no changes in whole-cell Na(V)1.5 protein or in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optical imaging in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers demonstrated slowed conduction velocity and a reduced maximum capture rate after FGF13 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi> are potent regulators of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels in adult ventricular myocytes and suggest that loss-of-function mutations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHFs</z:chebi> may underlie a similar set of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> that result from Na(V)1.5 loss-of-function mutations </plain></SENT>
