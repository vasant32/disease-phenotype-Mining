<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gene expression profiles of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated with a standardized willow bark extract (WB), its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17814">salicin</z:chebi> rich <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> fraction (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>-FR) or the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramine</z:chebi> were evaluated for their potential to induce adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments had shown antidepressant-like effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expression profiles (Agilent Whole Genome Array, n=4/group) obtained from the peripheral blood of male SD rats treated with WB (STW 33-I), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>-FR (30 mg/kg bw) or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramine</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg bw) were analysed comparatively by the Ingenuity Systems Programme, which allows to conduct model calculations of thresholds for theoretical potential adverse events (AE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of genes regulated by the three treatments were 1673 (WB), 117 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>-FR) and 1733 (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three treatments related to 47 disease clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The WB extract reached the threshold for a potential AE in one disease cluster (<z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>), whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>-FR exceeded the threshold in 5 disease clusters (cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> and stenosis, glomerular injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, alkaline phosphatase levels â‡‘) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">Imipramine</z:chebi> treatment hit 13 disease clusters: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, palpitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, precipitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo>, altered liver functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those correspond to known potential adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glomerular injury and altered liver functions are part of the side effect profile of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16914">salicylic acid</z:chebi> derivatives in agreement with the findings for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17814">salicin</z:chebi> rich <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16236">EtOH</z:chebi>-FR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no linear relationship between the number of constituents of a drug (preparation) and the number of different targets hit in a biological system on the gene expression level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the number of genetic targets in a biological system does not necessarily increase with the complexity of the treatment corresponding to the non-linear behaviour of biological systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regarding gene expression levels AE of single treatments are not necessarily additive in combination treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The applied method appears to be an interesting screening tool for the prediction of potential AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The phenomena that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47499">imipramine</z:chebi> crossed the potential threshold for AEs several times whereas the WB extract did reach the threshold level only once, however not backed by clinical data for this AE, deserves to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It questions the commonly assumed principle that substances with low number or without AE will have a poor efficacy </plain></SENT>
