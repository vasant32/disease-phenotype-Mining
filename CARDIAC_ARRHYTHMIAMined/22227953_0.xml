<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> have been associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited and inconsistent evidence exists on the association of blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medication use with AF risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 13 969 participants (25% African American, 45% men) free of AF at baseline from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (HDLc), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (LDLc), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and total cholesterol were measured at baseline (1987-1989) and each of 3 follow-up visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AF was ascertained through 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications with AF was estimated in 13 044 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities participants attending visit 2 (1990-1992), adjusting for covariates from the previous visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 18.7 years, there were 1433 incident AF cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of AF associated with a 1-SD increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels were as follows: HDLc, 0.97 (0.91-1.04); LDLc, 0.90 (0.85-0.96); total cholesterol, 0.89 (0.84-0.95); and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, 1.00 (0.96-1.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants taking <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications had an adjusted HR (95% CI) of AF of 0.96 (0.82-1.13) compared with those not taking medications, whereas those taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> had an adjusted HR of 0.91 (0.66-1.25) compared with those taking other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of LDLc and total cholesterol were associated with a lower incidence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, HDLc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were not independently associated with AF incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medications and incident AF </plain></SENT>
