<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Euphorbiaceae), on blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two compounds were isolated by column chromatography and their identity was confirmed spectroscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A healthy, male Wistar rat was used to record the invasive blood pressure and electrocardiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic effects of cleistanthins A and B were studied using the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B showed a dose-dependent hypotensive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both compounds reduced the mean blood pressure significantly although the dose required for the effect was higher in the case of cleistanthin B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the electrocardiogram, cleistanthins A and B significantly altered the electrical activity of the heart, the changes were transient and of no further consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of 64 microg or more of cleistanthins A and B caused a sudden respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> without affecting the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cleistanthins A and B did not display any antiarrhythmic effect against <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both cleistanthin A and cleistanthin B exert a hypotensive effect and have no antiarrhythmic effect against <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
