<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The open-irrigated catheter is used most frequently for atrial and ventricular radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and is often considered as the standard by which new ablation systems are compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But few data have been published concerning its safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report provides a comprehensive safety analysis of the use of an open-irrigated catheter for RFA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in 1,275 patients in six rigorously monitored, prospective, multicenter studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This analysis is of data from six studies conducted as part of both Food and Drug Administration-mandated investigational device exemption studies and postapproval studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The six studies span a period of more than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> serious RFA complications and vascular access complications that occurred within seven days postprocedure were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients who experienced any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> serious RFA complication in these studies combined was 4.9% (63/1,275) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two earliest studies were conducted when the open-irrigated catheter was first introduced, and accounted for 55.6% of the complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> ablation study, RFA complications decreased by 60% (15.4%-6.2%) after a proctoring program was initiated during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, vascular access complications ranged between from 0.5%-4.7%, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was reported within 7 days postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary vein stenosis</z:mp> was reported from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A proctoring program, careful fluid management, and absence of char and coagulum contributed to the safe use of the open-irrigated RFA catheter </plain></SENT>
