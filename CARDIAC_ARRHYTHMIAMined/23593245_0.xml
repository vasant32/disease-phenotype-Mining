<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP), a life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with prolongation of the QT interval, has been a significant reason for withdrawal of several medicines from the market </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of the QT interval is considered as the best biomarker for predicting the torsadogenic risk of a new chemical entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the difficulty assessing the risk for TdP during drug development, we evaluated the metabolic phenotype for predicting QT prolongation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9212">sparfloxacin</z:chebi>, and elucidated the metabolic pathway related to the QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed electrocardiography analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of plasma samples obtained from 15 guinea pigs after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9212">sparfloxacin</z:chebi> at doses of 33.3, 100, and 300 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis and partial least squares modelling were conducted to select the metabolites that substantially contributed to the prediction of QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QTc increased significantly with increasing dose (r = 0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> analysis, the key metabolites that showed the highest variable importance in the projection values (&gt;1.5) were selected, identified, and used to determine the metabolic network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17562">cytidine</z:chebi>-5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="114" ids="17239,3611">CDP</z:chebi>), deoxycorticosterone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17053,29958">L-aspartic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">stearic acid</z:chebi> were found to be final metabolomic phenotypes for the prediction of QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Metabolomic phenotypes for predicting drug-induced QT prolongation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9212">sparfloxacin</z:chebi> were developed and can be applied to cardiac toxicity screening of other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, this integrative pharmacometabolomic approach would serve as a good tool for predicting pharmacodynamic or toxicological effects caused by changes in dose </plain></SENT>
