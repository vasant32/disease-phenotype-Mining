<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Medication errors are common in primary care and are associated with considerable risk of patient harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether a pharmacist-led, information technology-based intervention was more effective than simple feedback in reducing the number of patients at risk of measures related to hazardous prescribing and inadequate blood-test monitoring of medicines 6 months after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this pragmatic, cluster randomised trial general practices in the UK were stratified by research site and list size, and randomly assigned by a web-based randomisation service in block sizes of two or four to one of two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The practices were allocated to either computer-generated simple feedback for at-risk patients (control) or a pharmacist-led information technology intervention (PINCER), composed of feedback, educational outreach, and dedicated support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allocation was masked to researchers and statisticians involved in processing and analysing the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allocation was not masked to general practices, pharmacists, patients, or researchers who visited practices to extract data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>[corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were the proportions of patients at 6 months after the intervention who had had any of three clinically important errors: non-selective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>) prescribed to those with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> without co-prescription of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49200">proton-pump inhibitor</z:chebi>; β blockers prescribed to those with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>; long-term prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or loop <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> to those 75 years or older without assessment of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> and electrolytes in the preceding 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cost per error avoided was estimated by incremental cost-effectiveness analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with Controlled-Trials.com, number ISRCTN21785299 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 72 general practices with a combined list size of 480,942 patients were randomised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 6 months' follow-up, patients in the PINCER group were significantly less likely to have been prescribed a non-selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> if they had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> without gastroprotection (OR 0·58, 95% CI 0·38-0·89); a β blocker if they had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> (0·73, 0·58-0·91); or an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or loop <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> without appropriate monitoring (0·51, 0·34-0·78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PINCER has a 95% probability of being cost effective if the decision-maker's ceiling willingness to pay reaches £75 per error avoided at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The PINCER intervention is an effective method for reducing a range of medication errors in general practices with computerised clinical records </plain></SENT>
