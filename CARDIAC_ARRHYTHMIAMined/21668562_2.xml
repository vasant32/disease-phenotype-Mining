<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) is an accepted treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) refractory to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify the patient, procedural, and follow-up factors associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences following PVAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical data were prospectively collected on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 385 consecutive patients who had 530 PVAI (age 58 ± 11 years, 63% paroxysmal AF-PAF, follow-up 2.8 ± 1.2 years) between February 2004 and March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECGs were recorded at each follow-up visit with Holter monitoring 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following PVAI and every 6 months thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrences &lt; 3 months post-PVAI were defined as early, 3 months-1 year post-PVAI as late, and &gt; 1 year post-PVAI as very late </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relationship between predictor variables and outcomes was modeled using Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late recurrences occurred in 42% with a lower rate among PAF versus non-PAF patients (39% vs 56%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 256 patients with ≥ 1-year follow-up, 121 (47%) had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) 1 year post-PVAI; 36 (30%) of these had a very late recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, non-PAF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and prior AAD failure predicted recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When entered into the model, early recurrences remained the only predictor of late recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with non-PAF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and prior failure of multiple AAD were more likely to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence post-PVAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early recurrences were the strongest predictor of late recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late and very late recurrences following PVAI were common and should be considered when planning long-term AF patient management.  </plain></SENT>
