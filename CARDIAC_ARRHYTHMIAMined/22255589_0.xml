<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracardiac signal analysis during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of paroxysmal AF led to the discovery of pulmonary vein as a triggering source of AF, which has led to the development of pulmonary vein ablation--an established curative therapy for drug-resistant AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complex, multicomponent and rapid electrical activity widely involving the atrial substrate characterizes persistent/permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Widespread nature of the problem and complexity of signals in persistent AF reduce the success rate of ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although signal processing applied to extraction of relevant features from these complex electrograms has helped to improve the efficacy of ablation therapy in persistent/permanent AF, improved understanding of complex signals should help to identify sources of AF and further increase the success rate of ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
