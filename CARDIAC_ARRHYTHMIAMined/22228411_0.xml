<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Due to the variable <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the human pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel hot balloon ablation catheter has been developed to improve ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy, histopathologic lesion characteristics, and thermodynamics of this technology were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Swine underwent left atrial (n = 24) and superior vena cava (SVC, n = 7) catheterization with a compliant balloon catheter filled with saline and contrast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> mapping and angiography, ablation was performed with radiofrequency energy heating of the balloon contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central balloon temperatures were varied from 60°C to 90°C, and durations of energy delivery were varied from 60 to 300 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endocardial and epicardial temperatures were recorded contiguous to the balloon during SVC ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathology was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a mean of 1.4 ± 0.9 ablations per <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> at 70°C, 93% were electrically isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Necropsy exam revealed extraostial lesions without charring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> ablated at temperatures ≥80°C and durations ≥180 s were associated with a high rate of successful isolation with a single ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Higher-temperature lesions displayed greater histopathologic uniformity, but more marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> lesions revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were observed and histopathology of the phrenic nerve and esophagus was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hot balloon ablation catheter appears to be a safe and effective tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Higher temperatures and longer ablation durations are associated with a higher single ablation success rate </plain></SENT>
