<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If there is no clear cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> detectable during comprehensive coroner's inquest (autopsy-negative cases), you have to consider LQTS and other heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A molecular genetic screening regarding mutations in associated genes can help to ensure the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and to protect affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing of LQTS, currently performed mainly by sequencing, is still very expensive and time consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this study we present a rapid and reasonable method for the simultaneously screening of some of the most common mutations associated with LQTS, focused on the KCNQ1 and KCNH2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the method of SNaPshot minisequencing, a total of 58 mutations were analyzed in four multiplex assays which were successfully established and optimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison with samples previously analyzed by direct sequencing showed concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, autopsy-negative cases were tested but no mutations could be observed in any of the specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presented method is well suitable for LQTS mutation screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An enhancement to further mutations and population-based investigations regarding mutation frequencies should be the aim of prospective studies </plain></SENT>
