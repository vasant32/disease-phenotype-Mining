<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed exome sequencing on 2 unrelated infants presenting with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> to discover a genetic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We ascertained 2 unrelated infants (probands) with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and dramatically <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> who were both born to healthy parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 parent-child trios were investigated with the use of exome sequencing to search for de novo genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then performed follow-up candidate gene screening on an independent cohort of 82 subjects with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> without an identified genetic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies were performed to determine the functional consequences of mutations discovered in 2 genes encoding calmodulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discovered 3 heterozygous de novo mutations in either CALM1 or CALM2, 2 of the 3 human genes encoding calmodulin, in the 2 probands and in 2 additional subjects with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutation carriers were infants who exhibited life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> combined variably with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and delayed neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations altered residues in or adjacent to critical calcium binding loops in the calmodulin carboxyl-terminal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recombinant mutant calmodulins exhibited several-fold reductions in calcium binding affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Human calmodulin mutations disrupt <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> binding to the protein and are associated with a life-threatening condition in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Defects in calmodulin function will disrupt important calcium signaling events in heart, affecting membrane ion channels, a plausible molecular mechanism for potentially deadly disturbances in heart rhythm during infancy </plain></SENT>
