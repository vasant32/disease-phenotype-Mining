<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> due to low-energy blunt trauma to the precordium (commotio cordis) has been described with a variety of sporting objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) relative to the shape of the impact object is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current experiment is to test whether the impact object shape is a clinical variable that affects the risk for commotio cordis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a juvenile swine model, impacts were given in random order with two different spherical shapes (72 mm diameter, equivalent to a baseball; 42 mm diameter, equivalent to a golf ball) and a flat round object 72 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Objects were equal in weight (150 g), thrown at 30 mph, and gated to the vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen swine received 144 impacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flat object did not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (P = .01 compared with the two spherical objects), nonsustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, ST elevation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The smaller diameter sphere caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in nine of 48 impacts (19%), and the larger diameter sphere caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in five of 48 impacts (10%; P = .25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The smaller diameter sphere was associated with a greater increase in left ventricular pressure (P &lt;.0001 and P = .001 compared with larger sphere only) and a higher likelihood of ST segment elevations (P &lt;.001 and P = .08 compared with larger sphere only) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> (Fisher's exact P = .008, and Fisher's exact P = .18 compared with larger sphere only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The shape of the projectile markedly influences the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> from chest wall impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect is likely mediated via a greater increase in left ventricular pressure with smaller diameter objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spreading the impact force over a larger area may decrease the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and has implications for the design of protective athletic equipment </plain></SENT>
