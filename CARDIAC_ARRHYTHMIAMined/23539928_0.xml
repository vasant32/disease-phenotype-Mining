<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: PED (Primary electrical disease) is an arrhythmogenic disease group that causes serious ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the absence of recognized structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although Thailand, which is a part of Southeast Asia, is an endemic area of PED, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, there is little known about demographic data and clinical outcome of PED among survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study demographic data and clinical outcome of PED among survivors of SCD in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed patient medical records for clinical characteristics, etiology, and clinical outcome of survivors of SCD between January 2002 and December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with PED who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structural heart and no obvious non-cardiac causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two survivors of SCD with PED (mean age 39 +/- 12, 49 males), mainly from the northeast and middle regions of Thailand, were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCD mainly occurred during times when patients were asleep or resting (50% and 15.4%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 survivors, 21 patients (40%) had a documented family history of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The etiology of survivors of SCD is composed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (63.5%), Early repolarization syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ERS</z:e>) (9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) (7.7%), and idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remaining 15.4% had <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> but not compatible with any etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A large number of patients (78.8%) completely recovered without neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred in 27 patients (51.9%) during mean follow-up period 56.5 +/- 35.4 months (4 to 137 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The recurrence was highest during the first year (32%) of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> is the most common etiology of survivors of SCD with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structural heart in Thailand Although the prognosis after resuscitation was good, recurrence was especially high during the first year and as a result, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation is needed for prevented recurrence of SCD </plain></SENT>
