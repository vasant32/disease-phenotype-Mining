<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">Citalopram</z:chebi> is a selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant that is widely used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data have indicated that high therapeutic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> doses may cause electrocardiographic abnormalities, and the regulatory authorities have amended its licenced dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present manuscript reviews the available data concerning <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> and cardiac toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Published data concerning the cardiac effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> were ascertained, and clinical data were considered separately between adverse effects arising from therapeutic use versus toxicity in the setting of intentional overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occurrence of electrocardiographic abnormalities has long been recognised as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> overdose; a dose-effect relationship for QT prolongation has been described in a number of large case series, including several cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, few data indicate the occurrence of QT prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after therapeutic doses, and a dose-effect relationship within the therapeutic range has only recently been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">Citalopram</z:chebi> is more likely to cause QT prolongation in patients with metabolic disturbance or pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A dose-effect relationship for QT prolongation exists across a broad range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> doses, such that caution must be exercised when prescribing high doses or if there are co-existent risk factors for QT effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The available data illustrate how clinical toxicity data may offer an earlier signal of cardiac effects than ascertained from conventional pharmacovigilance methods </plain></SENT>
