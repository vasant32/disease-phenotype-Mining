<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological studies were performed using a three-dimensional mapping system (CARTO(®)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Remote magnetic navigation (RMN) was available since 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up on an outpatient basis was conducted 3, 6, and 12 months after ablation and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 26 patients, 34 procedures were performed (one procedure n = 19, two n = 6, and three n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> forms (IART n = 30; AVNRT n = 4) were ablated manually (n = 25) or by RMN (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success reached in 29/34 forms (85.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean fluoroscopy time (FT) was 28.2 ± 20.7 min and mean procedure duration (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) was 290.9 ± 107.6 min.After a mean follow-up of 34.1 ± 24.5 months, 25/26 (96.2%) patients were free from IART or AVNRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the nine RMN ablations (mean follow-up 14.2 ± 5.8 months) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term success was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy time and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> were significantly reduced using RMN compared with manual ablation (11.9 ± 6.2 vs. 34.6 ± 20.6 min, 225.7 ± 24.1 vs. 312 ± 118.2 min, P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation of IART or AVNRT in patients post-Mustard/Senning operation for d-<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> has a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate for IART is about 30%; however, after a second ablation, long-term results are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remote magnetic navigation seems to improve single-procedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term success and significantly reduces FT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
