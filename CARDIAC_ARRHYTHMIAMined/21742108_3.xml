<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients fail initial ablation and undergo repeat ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about repeat ablation procedure times, complications, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated Kaplan-Meier freedom from AF by AF type and sex for initial and repeat ablations and for final status of 843 patients undergoing 1122 ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined complications, procedure times and reasons why patients do not undergo repeat ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis evaluated factors predicting ablation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial ablations were more successful in AF1 than AF2 or AF3 (P &lt; .0001) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each AF type, repeat ablations were more successful than initial ablations (P = .01 to &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedure times (139.1 ± 49.1 vs 135.3 ± 45.6 minutes, P = .248) and major complications (1.66% vs 2.87%, P = .216) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women had different clinical characteristics than men, similar initial and repeat ablation success rates but lower overall success because of fewer repeat ablations (57.8% vs 68.2%, P = .047) due to patient choice (P = .028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with either successful initial ablations or undergoing repeat ablations had late AF recurrence rates of 0% to 1.5% a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age (P = .012), larger left atria (P = .002), female sex (P = .001), AF2 (P &lt; .0001), AF3 (P = .003), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> (P = .003) predicted failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeat ablations are more successful than initial ablations, have similar procedure times and complication rates, help determine final success rates, and may explain sex difference in success rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For the best outcomes, patients should assume that a repeat ablation may be required to eliminate AF </plain></SENT>
