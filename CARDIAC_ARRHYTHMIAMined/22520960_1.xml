<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the nature and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of changes in the QRS complex in the offspring of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND METHODS: A total of 529 subjects, divided into 5 groups, were included in the study: (i) group DM (n = 92), patients with DM; (ii) group MetS (n = 125), patients with MetS; (iii) group O-DM (n = 109), offspring of patients with DM; (iv) group O-MetS (n = 122), offspring of patients with MetS; and (v) group HO (n = 81), offspring of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QRS parameters analyzed included amplitude, maximum QRS spatial vector magnitude, electrical axis (EA), and 3 electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> based on amplitude criteria: Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage, and Gubner criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with DM and MetS showed a significant leftward shift of the EA when compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A modest but significant leftward shift of EA was also observed in both offspring groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These EA and maximum QRS spatial vector magnitude changes were reflected in the individual leads of the 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of a positive diagnosis by accepted electrocardiographic criteria (ECG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo>) was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with DM and MetS displayed significant changes in QRS complex that suggest depolarization sequence deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar changes were observed also in the offspring of patients with DM and MetS, which suggests early subclinical cardiovascular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment in the offspring of patients with DM and MetS </plain></SENT>
