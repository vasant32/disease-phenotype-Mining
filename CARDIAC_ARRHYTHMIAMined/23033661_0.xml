<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate Fas protein expression of the myocardium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and its relationship with occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine autopsy cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> along with the heart samples were chosen from the archives in the Department of Forensic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, HUST from 1997 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other 11 cases which died of violence and other diseases were selected as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expressions of myocardial Fas protein in the samples were quantitatively detected by immunohistochemistry and computerized imaging analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Myocardial Fas protein expression increased significantly in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive color showed brown-yellow granulated or striped distribution in the longitudinal section of myocardial within the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and showed circular brown granules in the cross section of the cell membrane, while these changes were not observed in the control group though there was focal weak staining noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was observed between the experimental and control groups (P = 0.002), but no statistical significance was found for the average optical density value between these two groups (P = 0.675) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of Fas protein increased obviously in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such alteration in expression quantity and distribution of myocardial Fas protein may be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in the patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
