<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the functional relevance of PVG to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rhythm remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether PVG can modulate sinoatrial node (SAN) function.Methods and Results49 C57BL and 7 Connexin40(+/EGFP) mice were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunofluorescence labeling to characterize adrenergic and cholinergic neural elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVG projected postganglionic nerves to the SAN which entered the SAN as an extensive, mesh-like neural network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PVG neurons were adrenergic, cholinergic and biphenotypic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histochemical characterization of 2 human embryonic hearts showed similarities between mouse and human neuroanatomy: direct neural communications between PVG and SAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts PVG were stimulated using 200-2000&amp;emsp14;ms trains of pulses (300&amp;emsp14;µs, 400&amp;emsp14;µA, 200&amp;emsp14;Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PVG stimulation caused an initial heart rate (HR) slowing (36±9%) followed by acceleration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PVG stimulation in the presence of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> caused HR slowing (43±13%) that was sustained over 20 beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PVG stimulation with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> progressively increased HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time-course effects were enhanced with 1000 and 2000&amp;emsp14;ms trains (P&lt;0.05 vs 200&amp;emsp14;ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In optical mapping PVG stimulation shifted the origin of SAN discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 5 paroxysmal AF patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation, application of radiofrequency energy to the PVG area during sinus rhythm produced a decrease in heart rate similar to that observed in isolated mouse hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVG have functional and anatomical biphenotypic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They can have significant effects on the electrophysiological control of the SAN </plain></SENT>
