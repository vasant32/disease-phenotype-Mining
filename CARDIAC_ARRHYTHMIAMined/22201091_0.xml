<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, the preparation technology was worked out and it has been defined that optimal method of tabletting new galenic formulations, such as Vincabral and Vingerbin is direct pressing by using polifunctional additional formulations - Proslov SMCC (siliced methylceluslose) and Glikonat <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">Starch</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their influence on the technological characteristics are studied, so as the proportion of additional compounds are defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influence of technological parameters on technological characteristics of the tablets Vinkabral, Vingerbin were investigated and optimal conditions were selected: optimal humidity was 1.5-3.0%, Optimal compression power-105-120 mpa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the release of active substance - <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloids</z:chebi> from the tablets of Vinkabral and Vingerbin was studied using the methods of "rotary basket" in sour, neutral and alkaline area during the mix time 50 rt/min and 100 rt/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 90% of active substance releases in sour area during 75 minutes in 100 rt/min mix up condition </plain></SENT>
