<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only a few studies have analyzed the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in transplant patients with FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> requiring pacemaker insertion (PMI) in Swedish transplant patients with FAP, and we related the findings to gender, age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred four transplant patients with the amyloidogenic transthyretin Val30Met mutation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (25%) received a pacemaker during the observation period (a median of 11 years after disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This frequency was comparable to that noted in a previous study describing the natural course of FAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in PMI between early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cases (&lt;50 years old) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> cases (â‰¥ 50 years old) or between genders were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PMI was not significantly related to patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study confirms our previously reported short-time observation: LT does not prevent the development of heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> necessitating PMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is unrelated to gender or age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and the yearly risk does not appear to decrease with time after LT </plain></SENT>
