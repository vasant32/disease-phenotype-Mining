<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Superior vena cava (SVC) is one of the most important nonpulmonary vein origins of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and SVC should be carefully treated in order to decrease the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) should be performed prophylactically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pulmonary veins, prophylactic SVC isolation (SVCI) is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review describes recent data on treatments for SVC focus during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: There are two different major approaches to treat SVC focus during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One is the conventional approach, in which SVCI is performed only if <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> from SVC origin is recognized using pacing maneuvers and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another approach is performing SVCI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases prophylactically in addition to PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> freedom 1 year after initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation by prophylactic PVI along with SVCI was almost the same as with the conventional method (85-90% <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> freedom) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the conventional method also had a good result even 5 years after ablation (73.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Because of the good result after using the conventional approach and possible complications during SVCI, SVCI should be performed only if SVC focus is recognized, not prophylactically </plain></SENT>
