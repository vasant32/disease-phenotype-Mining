<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly prevalent in the elderly, AF is associated with morbidity and symptoms affecting HRQOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A PubMed and EMBASE search (1999-2010) was conducted using the terms <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, elderly, quality of life, Medicare, and Medicaid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 504 articles were identified and 15 were selected (studies examining pharmacotherapy [rate or rhythm control] and HRQOL in AF patients with a mean age â‰¥ 65 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information, including study design, cohort size, and HRQOL instruments utilized, was extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five observational studies, 5 randomized trials comparing rate and rhythm control, 3 randomized trials investigating pharmacologic agents, and 2 trials examining HRQOL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elderly AF patients had reduced HRQOL versus patients in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm, particularly in domains related to physical functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HRQOL may be particularly affected in older AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although data do not indicate whether a pharmacologic intervention or single treatment strategy-namely rate versus rhythm control-is better at improving HRQOL, either of these strategies and many pharmacologic interventions may improve HRQOL in elderly AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on reviewed data, an algorithm is suggested to optimize HRQOL among elderly patients </plain></SENT>
