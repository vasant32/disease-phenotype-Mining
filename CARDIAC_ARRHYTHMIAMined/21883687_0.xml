<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> in children during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed heart rate changes, RR intervals and QT changes during 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive QT and RR intervals were measured for 60 s before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and 60 s after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> during video electroencephalography monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> and 13 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>focal seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age during monitoring was 10.1 years (range 4 months-19 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was seen in every <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was only one dropped beat in a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean ictal heart-rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval was significantly higher than the postictal measurements (P= 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean ictal QTc variation tended to increase during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and then decreased below the pre-ictal measurements in the postictal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However these changes were statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RR variance was significantly decreased during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> compared to the postictal period and the standard deviation of the RR intervals was significantly decreased in the ictal period compared to the pre-ictal period (P= 0.014 and P= 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>Tachycardia</z:hpo> is the main finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are very rare despite being more frequent in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
