<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> were recorded before the administration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prolonged Q-Tc interval was the commonest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo>, found in 67 patients (62.6%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> in 36 patients (33.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>Sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> was found in 33 patients (30.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevation of ST segment was seen in 27 patients (25.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T wave inversion was seen in 21 patients (19.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>First-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> (P-R interval &gt;0.20 seconds) occurred in 9 cases (8.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was seen in 5 patients (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was seen in 6 cases (5.6%) and ventricular premature complexes in 3 patients (2.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 6 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> 1 responded to intravenous lignocaine, and the other 5 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> despite other resuscitative measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the electrocardiographical abnormalities returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> before the patients were discharged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in 5 patients and non-cardiogenic pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion it can be said that ECG should be carefully recorded and analysed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> organophosphorus poisoning, and depending upon these changes and other clinical and biochemical parameters, the patients should immediately be shifted to well equipped ICU for better care which will reduce the mortality rate caused by these highly lethal poisons </plain></SENT>
