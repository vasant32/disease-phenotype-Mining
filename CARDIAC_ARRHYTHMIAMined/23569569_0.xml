<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a frequently used recreational drug which imposes important health problems with even life-threatening cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic use of cocaine is nowadays restricted to topical anesthesia in ophthalmological and nasal surgery but the possible hazards of this local anesthesia are not always fully appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 51-year old male patient with moderate cardiovascular risk profile underwent elective nasal surgery and cocaine was used as a <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and cardiogenic shock occurred, mimicking an ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography showed diffuse spasm of the right coronary artery (RCA) which disappeared with intracoronary nitrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Urine analysis was positive for cocaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered completely with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiography and ECG at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine cardiotoxicity is not uncommon in the community but a particular situation arises when used in medicine as a topical <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report, to our knowledge, of a cardiogenic shock mimicking a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> with documentation of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> after cocaine use in nasal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One must be aware of the potential life-threatening complications in this low-risk surgery, moreover when safer alternatives are available </plain></SENT>
