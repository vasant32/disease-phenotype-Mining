<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the possibility that a frequent trigger action might play a role in the development of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PeAF) and the presence of a substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 263 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation (CA) for PeAF, electric cardioversion was performed at the beginning of the procedure to determine the presence or absence of an immediate recurrence of AF (IRAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined an IRAF as a reproducible AF recurrence within 90 s after restoration of sinus rhythm by electric cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a mean±SD of 1.3±0.5 sessions of CA, including pulmonary vein isolation and ablation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">premature atrial contractions</z:e> that triggered the IRAF (IRAF triggers), and observed the patients for 17 (10-27) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An IRAF was observed in 70 patients (27%), but we could not ablate the IRAF triggers in 16 (23%) of these IRAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate of PeAF was higher in patients with an unsuccessful IRAF trigger ablation than in those with successful IRAF trigger ablation (63% versus 11%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariable analysis also revealed that an unsuccessful IRAF trigger ablation was 1 of the independent predictors of recurrent PeAF (odds ratio, 10.9; 95% CI, 3.4-36.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the PeAF patients with an IRAF, successful elimination of the IRAF triggers, in addition to pulmonary vein isolation, resulted in a successful CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results imply that such triggers play a major role in the AF persistence in these PeAF patients </plain></SENT>
