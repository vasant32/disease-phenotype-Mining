<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the electrophysiological effects of sophocarpine on action potentials (AP) and ionic currents of cardiac myocytes and to compare some of these effects with those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Langendorff perfusion set-up was used in isolated guinea pig heart, and responses to sophocarpine were monitored using electrocardiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional microelectrode, voltage clamp technique and perforated patch were employed to record fast response AP (fAP), slow response AP (sAP) and ionic currents in guinea pig papillary muscle or rabbit sinus node cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tachyarrhythmia produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (15 μmol/L) could be reversed by sophocarpine (300 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sophocarpine (10 μmol/L) decreased the amplitude by 4.0%, maximal depolarization velocity (V(max)) of the fAP by 24.4%, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Na)) by 18.0%, while it prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP) by 21.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same concentration of sophocarpine could also decrease the amplitude and V(max) of the sAP, by 26.8% and 25.7%, respectively, and attenuated the Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> tail current substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of sophocarpine with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> demonstrated that both prolonged the duration and the ERP of fAP and sAP, both decreased the amplitude and V(max) of the fAP and sAP, and both slowed the automatic heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sophocarpine could reverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and inhibit I(Na), I(CaL), and I(Kr) currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological effects of sophocarpine are similar to those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, which might be regarded as a prospective antiarrhythmic agent </plain></SENT>
