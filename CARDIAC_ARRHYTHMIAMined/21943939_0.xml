<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these patients present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated clinical characteristics of patients with congenital LVA/D presenting with arrhythmic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the previous 20 years 250 patients were diagnosed to have congenital LVA/D at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made using echocardiography after exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, local cardiac inflammatory processes, traumatic causes, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At initial presentation 32 of the 250 patients (13%, average age 45 years, range 25 to 65, 21 men and 11 women) exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At least 2 LVA/Ds were present in 6 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LVA/Ds were localized at the posterobasal, apical, anteroseptal, and anterolateral walls in 12, 11, 4, and 5 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common complaints at presentation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or presyncope in 18 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term electrocardiographic recordings showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in 17 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients underwent electrophysiologic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmia, whereas induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was similar to that during spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with congenital LVA/Ds who present with arrhythmic manifestations commonly have VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic testing can reproduce clinical VT in most of these patients </plain></SENT>
