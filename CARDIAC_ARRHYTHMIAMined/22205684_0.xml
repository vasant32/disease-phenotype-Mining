<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One third of patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> (CTO), which is associated with long-term mortality in patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of CTO on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and long-term mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy for the prevention of SCD were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among other characteristics, the existence of CTO was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, the occurrence of appropriate device delivery because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> as well as mortality were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 162 patients (mean age, 62Â±9 years; 93% men) with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were included and followed for a median of 26 months (interquartile range, 12-42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At least 1 CTO was present in 71 (44%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Appropriate device therapy was detected in 18% of the patients during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of CTO was associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and mortality rates (log-rank test, &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis revealed that CTO was independently associated with appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> intervention (hazard ratio, 3.5; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for primary prevention of SCD, CTO is an independent predictor for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and has an adverse impact on long-term mortality </plain></SENT>
