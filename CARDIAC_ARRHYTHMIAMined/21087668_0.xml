<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can associate with and modulate various voltage gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in human MiRP1 have been found to cause many congenital and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndromes</z:hpo>, which are potentially life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, human MiRP1 was over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and eluted into different detergents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two dimensional (1)H-(15)N correlated solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the human MiRP1 in four different detergent micelles indicated that high resolution solution NMR spectrum can be obtained for human MiRP1 in detergent lyso-myristoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of human MiRP1 indicated a high content of alpha-helical secondary structure in LMPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Backbone assignments of most MiRP1 residues were achieved through a series of triple resonance NMR experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary structure analysis based on backbone chemical shifts showed several stretches of alpha-helices along the primary sequence of MiRP1 in LMPG </plain></SENT>
