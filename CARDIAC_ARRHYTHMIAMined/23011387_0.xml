<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prolonging atrial conduction time, as measured by tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>), is an independent predictor of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated atrial conduction time and cardiac mechanical function in patients with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with IFG (19 males and 11 females; age, 46.9 ± 9.5 years) and 30 control subjects (18 males and 12 females; age, 46.7 ± 8.2 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atrial conduction time was determined from the lateral mitral annulus (PA lateral), septal mitral annulus (PA septal), and lateral tricuspid annulus (PA tricuspid) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intra-atrial electromechanical delays (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMDs</z:e>) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left atrial (LA) volumes were determined according to the biplane area-length method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA mechanical function parameters were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LA passive emptying volume and LA passive emptying fraction decreased significantly in patients with IFG as compared with control subjects (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PA lateral and PA septal durations were significantly higher in patients with IFG than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no difference in PA tricuspid duration was observed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intra-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMDs</z:e> were significantly higher in patients with IFG as compared with the control subjects (median [interquartile range], 34.0 [17.0] vs. 17.0 [4.0], p &lt; 0.001 and 15.0 [8.5] vs. 7.5 [2.0], p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Positive correlations were detected between both inter- and intra-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were independently associated with inter-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> (β = 0.753, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We showed that IFG was associated with inter- and intra-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that IFG is an etiological factor for the development of AF </plain></SENT>
