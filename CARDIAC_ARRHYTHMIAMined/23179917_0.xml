<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Limitations imposed by the coronary sinus venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> triggered the transseptal approach for endocardial LV lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alignment of the interatrial septum (IAS) and its neighborhood <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> does not favor transseptal puncture from the pre-pectoral area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Locating and advancing a pre-pectoral LV lead delivery catheter (PDC) through an opening created in the IAS via femoral transseptal puncture (FTP) is time consuming and technically difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a method where the PDC is snare coupled to the femoral transseptal apparatus (FTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the FTA is advanced into the left atrium (LA) the coupled PDC follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The catheter of a 25-mm loop snare kit is replaced with the PDC (SelectSite®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The snare loop is positioned in the right common iliac vein from the pre-pectoral access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PDC is coupled to the FTA by advancing the transseptal apparatus through the open snare loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After conventional FTP, the FTA is withdrawn back into the right atrium (RA) over an extra support wire positioned in the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PDC with open snare loop is pulled over the FTA up to the RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PDC is advanced to close the snare loop on the extra support wire immediately distal to the tip of the dilator close to the puncture site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The PDC is deflected to align with the FTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The snare coupled catheters are gently advanced across the IAS into the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The PDC is released from the FTA by advancing the snare and opening the loop; the snare is then removed from the PDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PDC is deflected and advanced into the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After positioning the 4.1 Fr lumen less LV lead, the PDC is sliced and removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PDC snare coupled to the FTA was advanced into the LA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients, however, access was lost during catheter manipulation in the one right-sided case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Endocardial LV lead was successfully positioned in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Snare coupling the pre-pectoral SelectSite® catheter to the FTA is technically simple, reliable and a safe method for transseptal endocardial LV lead placement for left pre-pectoral implantation </plain></SENT>
