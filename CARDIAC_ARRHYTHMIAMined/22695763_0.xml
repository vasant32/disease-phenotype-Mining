<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no simple and reliable clinical method of measuring VVMD during CRT implant is currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the EnSite™ NavX™ system (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paul, MN, USA) can be used intraoperatively to determine VVMD, thereby facilitating CRT optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During CRT implant, the leads in the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), and left ventricle (LV) were connected to the EnSite™ NavX™ system to record the real-time 3D motion of the lead electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distances from RA to RV lead electrodes (RA-RV) and RA to LV lead electrodes (RA-LV) were computed over ten cardiac cycles during each of RV pacing and biventricular (BiV) pacing, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of synchrony was computed from the distance waveforms between RA-RV and RA-LV by a cross-covariance method to characterize VVMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Septal-to-posterior wall motion delay (SPWMD) from M-mode echocardiography (echo) was measured for reference at each pacing intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VVMD was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients undergoing CRT implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four of the five patients demonstrated clear improvement in EnSite™ NavX™-derived VVMD during BiV versus RV pacing, which corresponded to the SPWMD results by echo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to characterize VVMD and resynchronization in CRT patients with the EnSite™ NavX™ system during implant, demonstrating its potential as a tool for intraoperative CRT optimization </plain></SENT>
