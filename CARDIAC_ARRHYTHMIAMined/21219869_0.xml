<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electrophysiological investigations of hERG have centred on the hERG1a isoform, although native IKr channels may be comprised of hERG1a and hERG1b, which has a unique shorter N-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study has characterised for the first time the effects of extracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> (an extracellular pH decrease from 7.4 to 6.3) on hERG channels incorporating the hERG1b isoform </plain></SENT>
