<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that the analysis of P-waves extracted from ECG signals is helpful in understanding the predisposing factors to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, P-waves are usually highly corrupted by noise and harmonic artifacts and this makes quite difficult their analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently we proposed a novel algorithm for denoising P-waves based on the notion of quadratic variation reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is quite good in denoising P-waves affected by noise, but its effectiveness reduces when it is used in filtering out harmonic artifacts, like power-line interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper we propose an algorithm that overcomes this limitation and extends our previous method allowing it to both denoise and reject harmonic artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the approach and highlight its ability to remove both noise and artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The algorithm has reduced computational complexity and this makes it suitable for real-time applications </plain></SENT>
