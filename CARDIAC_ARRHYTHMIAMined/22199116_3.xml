<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown why disease penetrance and expressivity is so variable between individuals hosting identical mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study whether this can be explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNQ1's 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was performed in 84 LQT1 patients from the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and validated in 84 LQT1 patients from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were genotyped for SNPs in KCNQ1's 3'UTR, and six SNPs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms rs2519184, rs8234, and rs10798 were associated in an allele-specific manner with QTc and symptom occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with the derived SNP variants on their mutated KCNQ1 allele had shorter QTc and fewer symptoms, while the opposite was also true: patients with the derived SNP variants on their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> KCNQ1 allele had significantly longer QTc and more symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays showed that the expression of KCNQ1's 3'UTR with the derived SNP variants was lower than the expression of the 3'UTR with the ancestral SNP variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that 3'UTR SNPs potently modify disease severity in LQT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The allele-specific effects of the SNPs on disease severity and gene expression strongly suggest that they are functional variants that directly alter the expression of the allele on which they reside, and thereby influence the balance between proteins stemming from either the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or the mutant KCNQ1 allele </plain></SENT>
