<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> are known to exercise less and have poorer health behaviors than average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical fitness and physiological regulation during exercise tasks have not been investigated to date among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied autonomic modulation in a stepwise exhaustion protocol in 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and in matched controls, using spirometry and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters of physical capacity were determined at the aerobic, anaerobic, and vagal thresholds (VT), as well as for peak output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VT was correlated with psychopathology, as assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, with the inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and with peak output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MANOVA for heart and breathing rates, as well as for vagal modulation and complexity behavior of heart rate, indicated a profound lack of vagal modulation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intensity levels, even after the covariate <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> concentration was introduced as a measure of smoking behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly decreased physical capacity was demonstrated at the aerobic, anaerobic, and VT in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the exercise task, reduced vagal modulation in patients correlated negatively with positive symptoms and with levels of IL-6 and TNF-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study shows decreased physical capacity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upcoming intervention studies need to take into account the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e>, which might predispose patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results of inflammatory parameters are suggestive of a reduced activity of the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway in patients, leading to a pro-inflammatory state </plain></SENT>
