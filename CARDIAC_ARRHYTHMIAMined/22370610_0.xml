<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Assess the most common treatment on AF in an outpatient specialized clinic for management of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the clinical profile of the population studied was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional study assessing the most used strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> control in 167 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical profile was also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A standardized form was used for data collection and statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 13.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In This high risk population for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (61% had CHADS(2) ≥ 2), 54% of patients had paroxysmal or persistent AF, 96.6% were on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, and 76.6% on beta-blocker (rate control 81,2% x rhythm control 58,8%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart rate control was the most used strategy (79.5% x 20.5%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistical tendency towards more patients with ventricular dysfunction (15.2% x 2.9%; p = 0.06), CHADS(2) ≥ 2 (60.5% x 39.5%; p = 0.07) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve diseases</z:e> (25.8% x 11.8%; p = 0.08) was observed in the heart rate control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this high risk population for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, the rate control strategy was the most used </plain></SENT>
