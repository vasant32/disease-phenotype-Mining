<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF increases the overall risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> five-fold, accounting for approximately 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and is associated with particularly severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the last 50 years, long-term anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> has been the most effective therapy for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with AF and other risk factors, but their use has a lot of limitations and drawbacks (frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, food and drug interactions, delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action etc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, new oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> have emerged that seem to overcome those limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have proven, in large, multicenter, randomized, phase III, clinical studies, to be at least as efficient as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RELY and ROCKET AF trials have contributed to market approval of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively and made them available to clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The oral anticoagulation landscape is changing rapidly and these new agents seem to be very promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However future post-marketing studies and registries will help clarify their efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
