<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to demonstrate that GH secretagogues (GHS) ghrelin and its synthetic analog hexarelin can preserve the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes experiencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated hearts from adult male mice underwent 20 min global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 30 min reperfusion using a Langendorff apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ghrelin (10 nM) or hexarelin (1 nM) was administered in the perfusion solution either 10 min before or after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, termed pre- or posttreatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiomyocytes isolated from these hearts were used for whole-cell patch clamping to measure AP, voltage-gated L-type calcium current (I(CaL)), transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(to)), and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (I(Na)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AP amplitude and duration were significantly decreased by I/R, but GHS treatments maintained their normality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GHS treatments prevented the decrease in I(CaL) and I(Na) after I/R, thereby maintaining AP amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the significant increase in I(to) after I/R partially explained the shortened AP duration, the normalization of it by GHS treatments might contribute to the preservation of AP duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated p38 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and the downstream active caspase-9 in the cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway were significantly increased after I/R but not when GHS treatments were included, whereas phosphorylation of ERK1/2 associated with cell survival showed increase after I/R and a further increase after GHS treatments by binding to its receptor GHS receptor type 1a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest GHS can not only preserve the electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes after I/R but also inhibit cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and promote cell survival by modification of MAPK pathways through activating GHS receptor type 1a </plain></SENT>
