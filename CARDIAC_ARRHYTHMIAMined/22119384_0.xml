<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of different doses of enkephalin analogue Eribis <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 94 (EP 94) in a porcine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A secondary aim was to analyse the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion on the expression of opioid receptor subtypes in the porcine heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four anesthetised pigs underwent 40 min of balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by four hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pigs were given either vehicle (0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>) or one of four doses of EP 94 (0.2, 1, 5 or 25 ug/kg at each administration, respectively), intravenously after 26, 33 and 40 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearts were stained to quantify area at risk and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of the opioid receptor subtypes were detected with RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry in the control and ischaemic/reperfused areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant dose-response relationship between higher doses of EP 94 and reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of κ- and δ-opioid receptors was detected at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ischaemic/reperfused areas, an increased expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for both receptors was observed, whereas only protein expression for the δ subtype was up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The μ-opioid receptor was not detected </plain></SENT>
