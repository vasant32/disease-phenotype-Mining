<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of studies on the prognostic significance of frontal QRS-T angle, which is more readily available from the standard 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the importance of wide frontal QRS-T angle, QRS-axis, and T-wave axis as cardiac risk predictors in general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the 12-lead ECGs of 10 957 Finnish middle-aged subjects from the general population recorded between 1966 and 1972, and followed them for 30 ± 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QRS-T angle 0 to 90°, QRS-axis -30 to 90°, and T-wave axis 0 to 90° were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and the secondary endpoints were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and non-arrhythmic cardiac mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QRS-T angle ≥ 100° was present in 2.0% of the subjects, and it was associated with an increased risk of sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> [relative risk (RR) 2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-3.21; P&lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (RR 1.57; CI 1.34-1.84; P&lt; 0.001), but not with non-arrhythmic cardiac mortality (RR 1.34; CI 0.93-1.92; P= 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of wide QRS-T angle was mainly due to <z:mp ids='MP_0010505'>abnormal T-wave</z:mp> axis, which predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RR 2.13; CI 1.63-2.79; P&lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (RR 1.39; 1.24-1.55; P&lt; 0.001), and non-arrhythmic cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (RR 1.87; CI 1.50-2.34; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Frontal QRS-T angle ≥ 100° increases the risk of arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, this being mainly the result of an altered T-wave axis </plain></SENT>
