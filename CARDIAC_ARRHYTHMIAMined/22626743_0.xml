<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) or an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for resynchronization therapy often visit the hospital for unscheduled examinations, placing a great burden on healthcare providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that Internet-based remote interrogation systems could reduce emergency healthcare visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter randomized trial involving 200 patients compared remote monitoring with standard patient management consisting of scheduled visits and patient response to audible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> alerts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the rate of emergency department or urgent in-office visits for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 16 months, such visits were 35% less frequent in the remote arm (75 versus 117; incidence density, 0.59 versus 0.93 events per year; P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 21% difference was observed in the rates of total healthcare visits for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related events (4.40 versus 5.74 events per year; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> alert condition to review of the data was reduced from 24.8 days in the standard arm to 1.4 days in the remote arm (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' clinical status, as measured by the Clinical Composite Score, was similar in the 2 groups, whereas a more favorable change in quality of life (Minnesota Living With <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart Failure</z:hpo> Questionnaire) was observed from the baseline to the 16th month in the remote arm (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring reduces emergency department/urgent in-office visits and, in general, total healthcare use in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> or defibrillators for resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with standard follow-up through in-office visits and audible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> alerts, remote monitoring results in increased efficiency for healthcare providers and improved quality of care for patients </plain></SENT>
