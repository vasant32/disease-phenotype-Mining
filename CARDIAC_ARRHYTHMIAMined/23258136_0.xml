<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 60 patients who underwent valve surgery at our hospital from April 2008 to July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the landiolol group (30 patients) and the control (no landiolol) group (30 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the landiolol group, continuous intravenous landiolol was initiated immediately on admission to the intensive care unit at a dose of 10 Âµg/kg/ minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was compared between the groups over an observation period of 72 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurred in 6 patients (20%) in the landiolol group and 16 (53.3%) in the control group during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Landiolol <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> significantly reduced the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postoperative phase after heart valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was significantly decreased by landiolol, but aggravation of hemodynamics was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that landiolol is a useful drug for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after valve surgery </plain></SENT>
