<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of intra-atrial reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (IART) increases with age in Fontan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to characterize the atrial electroanatomic substrate for IART late after Fontan surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Detailed electroanatomic mapping of the right atrium (RA) was performed in 11 consecutive patients (33 ± 9 years) with older style Fontan circulation (atriopulmonary and atrioventricular connection) who underwent their first radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for IART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparative group of 30 non-Fontan <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) patients were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fontan patients had larger RA (P = 0.004), larger low-voltage area ≤ 0.5 mV (P = 0.01), and more fractionated potentials (P &lt; 0.001) than non-Fontan CHD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RA enlargement correlated significantly with both low-voltage zones (Spearman ρ= 0.68, P &lt; 0.001) and fractionated potentials (Spearman ρ= 0.48, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among Fontan patients, both age and time since Fontan surgery were significantly correlated to the amount of low-voltage areas (Spearman ρ= 0.87, P &lt; 0.001; Spearman ρ= 0.63, P = 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Successful RFCA was accomplished in 30 (73%) patients and was less likely in Fontan patients (54% vs 83%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger RA was significantly associated with a lower success rate (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up duration of 2.3 ± 1.6 years, IART recurred in 47% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger RA size and larger low-voltage areas predicted IART recurrence after RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fontan patients demonstrate progressive adverse atrial electrical remodeling with increasing age and time since surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Newer strategies beyond surgical incisions, such as pharmacotherapies that retard the progression of atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, may be required to reduce the long-term risk of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
