<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The changes in hemodynamics are variable, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, and one of the few consistent changes is a sudden fall in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures (suggesting a reduced vascular resistance) followed by a decline in heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor components of the RS to hemodynamics was evaluated by a computer model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This lumped-parameter computer simulation was based on equivalent electronic circuits (EECs) that reflect the hemodynamic conditions of a heart with severe AVS and a concomitantly decreased contractility as a long-term detrimental consequence of compensatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EECs model simulated the resetting of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tone in the heart and systemic circuit during exercise and exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, the fluctuating intra-thoracic pressure during respiration, and the passive relaxation of ventricle during diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this simulation were consistent with the published case reports of exertional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients with AVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of the EEC model is its ability to quantify the effect of a selective and gradable change in heart rate, ventricular contractility, or systemic vascular resistance on the hemodynamics during an exertional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients with severe AVS </plain></SENT>
