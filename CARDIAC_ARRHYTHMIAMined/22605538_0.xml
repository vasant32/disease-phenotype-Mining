<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 234 sequential hospitalized patients with a listed <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> and/or iodinated radiocontrast agent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> who received oral or intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> between January 2006 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographic and clinical data, as well as documentation of an allergic reaction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, were collected for each patient from electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean ± SD age was 69 ± 12 years, and 51% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 234 patients, 167 (71%) had a listed previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to iodinated contrast agents, 55 (24%) to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>, and 12 (5%) to both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received an average inpatient total dose of 2.9 ± 3.2 g of either oral (106 patients [45%]), intravenous (39 patients [17%]), or both oral and intravenous (89 patients [38%]) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 1 (0.4%) of the 234 patients was identified as having a probable allergic reaction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (score of 6 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One additional patient receiving intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> experienced a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> that was determined to be caused by an antibiotic </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of hypersensitivity reaction to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in hospitalized patients with a listed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> or iodinated contrast agents was less than 1%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified reactions were without long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
