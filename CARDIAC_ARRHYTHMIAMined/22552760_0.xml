<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies with 2-3-year follow-up have reported satisfactory control of AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of hybrid therapy after a follow-up of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that longer term follow-up would demonstrate eventual failure of this strategy to control AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive, retrospective evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> first time ablations of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> at the University of Pennsylvania between August 2003 and August 2005 was performed (n = 179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 33 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> only after treatment of AF with class I antiarrhythmic drugs and was continued on them post-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data were obtained by reviewing records from our institution, from referring cardiologists, and from direct patient questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> recurrence was noted in 28 of 31 patients (90.3 %) who completed 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AF recurrence typically resulted in significant symptoms, although 21 % developed persistent AF and were eventually minimally symptomatic on a rate control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A wide range of time to recurrence was observed (0.2-64.5 months) with 39 % recurring greater than 2 years post-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hybrid therapy is not effective for long-term control of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients should be counseled about the likelihood of eventual AF recurrence and anticoagulation should be maintained indefinitely when this strategy is used </plain></SENT>
