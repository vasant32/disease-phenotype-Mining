<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study has examined the role of GJ (gap junctions) in the delayed anti-arrhythmic effect of cardiac pacing, with particular reference to the time-course changes in Cx43 (connexin43) expression both after pacing (4×5 min, at a rate of 240 beats/min) and 24 h later, when the dogs were subjected to a 25 min occlusion and reperfusion of the LAD (left anterior descending coronary artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared with the SP (sham-paced) controls (n=20), in dogs paced 24 h previously (n=16) there were reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> severity [e.g. number of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPB</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp>) during occlusion 294±78 compared with 63±25; survival from the combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>/reperfusion insult 20% compared with 78%], and in other ischaemic changes [epicardial ST-segment, TAT (total activation time) and tissue impedance] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pacing also prevented the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced structural impairment of the intercalated discs, and preserved GJ permeability and Cx43 phosphorylation, without modifying Cx43 protein content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following cardiac pacing the membrane and total Cx43 protein contents were unchanged up to 6 h, but were significantly reduced 12 h later (preceded by a down-regulation of Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> at 6 h), and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, dogs that were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> 12 h after cardiac pacing showed increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cardiac pacing results in time-dependent changes in Cx43 expression, which may alter GJ function and influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> generation during a subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>/reperfusion insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect is manifested in protection 24 h after pacing, but of potential clinical interest is the finding that there is a time interval after pacing during which an ischaemic event may generate severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
