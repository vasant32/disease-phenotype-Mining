<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of postoperative pain main complications are cardiocirculatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> with employment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi> plus spinal opioids may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications in postoperative period of patients in these conditions, comparing with classical methods of postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, opioids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>, administered upon patient's demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Eighty adult patients, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> I and II, without ECG alterations, were allocated into two groups of 40: Group A, patients under general anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, cisatracurium and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, associated with epidural anesthesia with catheter and control of postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> and epidural <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi>; and Group B, patients under general anesthesia with the same drugs and doses of A, plus postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> carried out with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> and intravenous <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> at the end of surgery and in regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups Holter was applied for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pain evaluation was carried out through visual analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In pain evaluation, an evident predominance of 0 score (p&lt;0.001) was observed in Group A and there was also reduction of blood pressure levels in postoperative period in a more accentuated way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias were five times more frequent in Group B (p=0.00001), in which a tendency to a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> in age&gt;50 years (22.2% versus 0.0%. p=0.26) was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significative difference of heart rate among groups (p&gt;0.05) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The best quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> in postoperative period, carried out in Group A, reduced the incidence of cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
