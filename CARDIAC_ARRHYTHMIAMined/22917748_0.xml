<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF initiates self-perpetuating changes in electrophysiology, structure and functional properties of the atria, a phenomenon known as atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that reversal of atrial remodeling is possible with correction of antecedent conditions, however the timing of the intervention or upstream therapy may be critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review will describe the pathophysiology of atrial remodeling as it pertains to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We will describe components of remodeling including changes in atrial refractoriness, conduction and atrial structure, in addition to autonomic changes and anatomic factors that predispose to remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We will discuss our current understanding of the electrophysiological changes that contribute to AF persistence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We will describe nature of atrial and pulmonary vein remodeling in the context of different forms of AF, with and without predisposing risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will describe the nature of remodeling over time following therapeutic interventions such as AF ablation in order to show that it does not necessarily improve and may worsen </plain></SENT>
