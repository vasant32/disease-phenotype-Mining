<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ablation of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients (age 62 ± 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic heart disease</z:e> or AF (age 36 ± 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SRF (338 ± 150 points) and CFAE (418 ± 135 points) regions comprised 29% ± 14% and 25% ± 15% of the left atrial surface area, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% ± 13% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target </plain></SENT>
