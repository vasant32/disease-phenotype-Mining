<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple, specific, sensitive, precise and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography method with fluorescence detection has been developed and validated for the determination of atenolol in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After addition of the internal standard, the analytes were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The calibration graph for atenolol was linear in a 10-1,000 ng/mL concentration range (r &gt; 0.999), using 0.5-mL plasma samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay precision of the method was less than 6.4%, the assay accuracy ranged between 99.6% and 101.6%, and the absolute recovery of atenolol and internal standard was better than 66.1% and 76.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was found to be suitable for the quantification of atenolol in a pharmacokinetic study after a single oral administration of 100 mg atenolol to 18 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
