<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted two randomized, controlled, open-label studies (EMERALD 1 and EMERALD 2) involving patients undergoing hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular safety was evaluated by analysis of an adjudicated composite safety end point--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or serious adverse events of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>--with the use of pooled data from the two EMERALD studies and two studies involving patients not undergoing dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the EMERALD studies, 1608 patients received peginesatide once monthly or continued to receive epoetin one to three times a week, with the doses adjusted as necessary to maintain a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level between 10.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was the mean change from the baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level to the mean level during the evaluation period; noninferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher in the comparison of peginesatide with epoetin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of evaluating the composite safety end point in the pooled cohort was to exclude a hazard ratio with peginesatide relative to the comparator ESA of more than 1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In an analysis involving 693 patients from EMERALD 1 and 725 from EMERALD 2, peginesatide was noninferior to epoetin in maintaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (mean between-group difference, -0.15 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.30 to -0.01 in EMERALD 1; and 0.10 g per deciliter; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.26 in EMERALD 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for the composite safety end point was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.26) with peginesatide relative to the comparator ESA in the four pooled studies (2591 patients) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17) in the EMERALD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients with adverse and serious adverse events were similar in the treatment groups in the EMERALD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular safety of peginesatide was similar to that of the comparator ESA in the pooled cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peginesatide, administered monthly, was as effective as epoetin, administered one to three times per week, in maintaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
