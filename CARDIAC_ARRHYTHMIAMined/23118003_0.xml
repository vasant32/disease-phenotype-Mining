<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Ivabradine is a specific blocker of the pacemaker current (I(f)) used to decrease the sinus rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several clinical trials have shown that it is beneficial, with or without concomitant beta-blocker therapy, in patients with stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to take advantage of ivabradine's ability to decrease the maximal obtainable sinus rate in order to prevent inappropriate shocks due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> in patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective open-label series including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients with an implanted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> who, during the course of 2010-2011, received ivabradine with the only purpose of preventing inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These are patients who received one or more inappropriate shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> or were conceived to be at very high risk for developing such complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our series includes five patients who received ivabradine (5-10 mg/day) in addition to their usual beta-blocker therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 14 months no inappropriate shocks due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is sensible to recommend ivabradine for the prevention of inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> in carefully selected patients </plain></SENT>
