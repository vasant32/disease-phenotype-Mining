<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a 50-year-old man who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, there were no findings suggesting an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was maintained using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> combined with epidural anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG waves were stable during the initial stage of laparoscopic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After establishment of small laparotomy for stomach resection, the blood pressure decreased to before 60 mmHg without remarkable ST change on lead II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of intravenous ephedrine was not effective and a short run appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> followed by ventricular standstill developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chest compression and intravenous adrenalin restored sinus rhythm, and thereafter the patient remained hemodynamically stable with intravenous <z:chebi fb="10" ids="28787">nitroglycerine</z:chebi> and nicorandil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The operation was completed and the patient awoke without neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively the coronary angiography showed no stenosis of coronary arteries; however, when <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> test was attempted on right coronary artery, paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in accordance with spasm of #1 segmental coronary artery developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the case of abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary vasospasm</z:e> should be suspected even when ST changes are not recognized with routine ECG monitor </plain></SENT>
