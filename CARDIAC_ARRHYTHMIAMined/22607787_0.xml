<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies on long-term outcomes of the arterial switch operation (ASO) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>) are uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we sought to determine the long-term outcomes for patients after ASO performed at a single institution over a 25-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1983 to 2009, 618 patients underwent the ASO for <z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp> and were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall early mortality was 2.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on multivariate analysis were resection of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at time of ASO (p = 0.001), weight less than 2.5 kg at time of ASO (p &lt; 0.001), associated <z:mp ids='MP_0011676'>aortic arch obstruction</z:mp> (p = 0.043), and the need for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 10.6 years (range 2 months to 26.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late mortality was 0.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reintervention was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> or arch obstruction versus those without them (25.2% and 23.4% vs 5.9% at 15- year follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for late reintervention were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at time of ASO (p &lt; 0.001) and a greater <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from at least moderate neoaortic valve regurgitation for the entire cohort was 98.7% (95% confidence interval 96.8 to 99.5%) at 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mild neoaortic regurgitation was seen in 25.6% of patients at mean follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ASO can be performed with good long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0011676'>aortic arch obstruction</z:mp> warrant close follow-up </plain></SENT>
