<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gasoline is a complex and highly variable mixture of aliphatic and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33658">aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> that can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> due to sensitization of the myocardium to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> or acts as a simple asphyxiant if the vapors displace sufficient oxygen from the breathing atmosphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work describes a sudden occupational fatality involving gasoline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of this petroleum distillate detection and its quantitative toxicological significance is discussed using a validated analytical method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 51 year-old Caucasian healthy man without significant medical history was supervising the repairs of the telephone lines in a manhole near to a gas station </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He died suddenly after inhaling gasoline vapors from an accidental leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blistering</z:mp> and peeling of skin were observed on the skin of the face, neck, anterior chest, upper and lower extremities, and back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The internal examination showed a strong odor of gasoline, specially detected in the respiratory tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The toxicological screening and quantitation of gasoline was performed by means of gas chromatography with flame ionization detector and confirmation was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disposition of gasoline in different tissues was as follows: heart blood, 35.7 mg/L; urine, not detected; vitreous humor, 1.9 mg/L; liver, 194.7 mg/kg; lung, 147.6 mg/kg; and gastric content, 116,6 mg/L (2.7 mg total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based upon the toxicological data along with the autopsy findings, the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined to be gasoline poisoning and the manner of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was accidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We would like to alert on the importance of testing for gasoline, and in general for volatile <z:chebi fb="88" ids="24632">hydrocarbons</z:chebi>, in work-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> involving inhalation of <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> vapors and/or exhaust fumes </plain></SENT>
