<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>Myocarditis</z:mp> that develops because of the drug reaction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a life-threatening disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of DRESS-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for cardiovascular support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 14-year-old boy experienced DRESS-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> after anticonvulsive therapy with carbamazepine, clonazepam and phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical signs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and poor left ventricular (LV) performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations showed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy for 3 days was administered for treating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142139" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">DRESS syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient required inotropic drugs including <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, dobutamine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> because of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and poor LV function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was placed on ECMO support, and intra-aortic balloon pumping was initiated because of poor response to inotropic drugs and stasis of blood flow in the ventricle on hospital day 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma exchanges for four separate times over 8 days were also performed during ECMO support on day 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His condition stabilized 13 days after ECMO support was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged on hospital day 50, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was controlled by the oral form clonazepam, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, topiramate and levetiracetam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three months later, an echocardiogram showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Drug reaction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and systemic symptoms-associated fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> is a life-threatening disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> administration, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and ventricular assist device implantation have been used for the treatment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case of DRESS-associated fulminant <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> treated successfully with ECMO support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, echocardiogram should be followed regularly because <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may be the late sequela </plain></SENT>
