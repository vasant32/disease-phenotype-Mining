<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This requires a system with a minimal impact on daily activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if a lightweight integrated adhesive monitor for long-term use without unacceptable adverse effects is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The participants wore either a prototype lightweight monitor or a control system for a total of up to 30 days, changing patches once (investigational device) or twice (control) weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comfort, skin irritation, and impact on quality of life were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The new monitor can be worn by most participants for periods of at least 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin irritation and comfort rating were comparable, and impact on the quality of life was low compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients considered the device comfortable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An integrated adhesive monitor that can be worn on the skin up to 7 days with minimal side effects is feasible </plain></SENT>
