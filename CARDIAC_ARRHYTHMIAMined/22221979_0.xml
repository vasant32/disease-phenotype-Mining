<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various types of markers have been used so far in order to reveal myocardial perfusion defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these markers usually appear in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> phase or in the late stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Having been the focus of various investigations recently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-modified albumin (IMA) is helpful in establishing diagnosis in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, before <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 30 patients that underwent only coronary bypass surgery due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> within a specific period of time have been included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IMA levels were studied in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The albumin <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi> binding assay was used for IMA determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic parameters (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the need for inotropic support, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>) of the patients in the postoperative stage were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative measurement values (mean ± SD) of IMA (0.67677 ± 0.09985) were statistically significantly higher than those in the preoperative (0.81516 ± 0.08894) and postoperative (0.70477 ± 0.07523) measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and need for inotropics, a parallelism was detected with the levels of IMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IMA is an early-rising marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> and enables providing a direction for the treatment at early phases </plain></SENT>
