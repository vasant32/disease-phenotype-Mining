<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to compare the results of NT-proBNP measurements in healthy dogs and dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> as well as asymptomatic dogs with heart murmur with the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April 2007 and December 2007 dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> of non-cardiac origin (n=11), dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> of cardiac origin (n=18) and asymptomatic dogs with heart murmur (n=22) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve clinically healthy dogs served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals underwent cardiologic examination including echocardiography and measurement of serum NT-proBNP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum was centrifuged and frozen within 30 minutes and was stored frozen until analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median NT-proBNP concentration in healthy dogs was 240 pmol/l (range 131-546 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e> displayed a median NT-proBNP concentration of 876 pmol/l (range 97-2614 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> of non-cardiac origin, there was a difference in the values of NT-proBNP of dogs with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> diagnosed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> of cardiac origin displayed a median NT-proBNP concentration of 2000 pmol/l (range 137-2614 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NT-proBNP values were only found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median NT-proBNP concentration in asymptomatic dogs with heart murmur was 698.5 pmol/l (range 121-2614 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Considerably increased values were particularly measured in asymptomatic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: NT-proBNP represents a useful additional diagnostic parameter in veterinary clinical cardiology to assess the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interpretation must take into consideration the clinical picture of the patient, as dogs with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> may display high NT-proBNP levels without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the following cut-off values: &lt;500 pmol/l: no relevant cardiac load; 500-900 pmol/l: moderate cardiac load; &gt;900 pmol/l: severe cardiac load </plain></SENT>
