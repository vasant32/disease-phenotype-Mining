<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared between 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the 5 beats were subsequently averaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the groups as to average corrected QT interval length, average QTd interval, average QT corrected dispersion, or QT dispersion ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>JT dispersion and JT corrected dispersion were also similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> seem to have QT and JT dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future research and longer follow-ups should be conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic importance of repolarization dispersion parameters in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
