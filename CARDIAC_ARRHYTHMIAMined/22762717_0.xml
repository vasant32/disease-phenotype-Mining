<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several recent studies have investigated the prognostic value of LGE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss the prevalence and patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> in HC and its pathophysiologic significance, with focus on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The available evidence that myocardial scar demonstrated by LGE is a good independent predictor of cardiac mortality in HC is summed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recommendations of current guidelines for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in HC are discussed with regard to recent results, and the significance of LGE as an emerging risk factor is pointed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is demonstrated that LGE has incremental value in addition to clinical risk factors for risk stratification and management of patients with HC </plain></SENT>
