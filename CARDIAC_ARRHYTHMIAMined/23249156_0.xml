<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Automated blood pressure (BP) monitors with implemented AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection systems may be a useful tool for early diagnosis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic review (Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane) of studies was performed to assess the accuracy of modified BP monitors (for diagnosing AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of five studies (four tests in the physician's office and one at home) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the most accurate AF detection, three sequential BP measurements should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct comparison against a 12-lead ECG showed that the highest sensitivity, 97% (95% CI: 94-100%), for detecting AF was obtained when three readings were assessed with two or three AF-positive readings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest specificity (97%) was obtained when performing three measurements, of which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three must be AF positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The modified BP monitor (Microlife Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan) has high potential in improving AF screening </plain></SENT>
