<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical pharmacology studies in adults receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> demonstrated a dose-dependent mean increase (4.5-19.5 milliseconds [ms]) in QTc over the range of 40-160 mg/d with a small incremental increase (22.5 ms) at 320 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a comparative study of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> versus five <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, the mean QTc increase at steady state maximum concentration (C(max)) for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> was 15.9 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> on QTc were studied in phase II-IV randomized controlled trials (RCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide clinicians and clinical researchers with a comprehensive analysis of QTc changes associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> based on data from Pfizer-sponsored phase II-IV RCTs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> patients, safety reports and post-marketing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The following analyses of data were conducted to obtain a comprehensive summary of QTc data on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi>: (i) post hoc analyses (using primarily descriptive statistics) of pooled QTc data (Fridericia correction) from more than 40 phase II-IV adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> RCTs organized according to the following subgroups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> monotherapy studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intramuscular (IM) studies, adjunctive studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> and fixed-dose oral studies; (ii) post hoc analyses from 36 phase II-IV adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> RCTs exploring the relationship between QTc change from baseline and baseline QTc in adults; (iii) post hoc analyses from phase II-IV adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> RCTs modelling QTc change as a function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> concentration in both adult (17 studies) and paediatric (5 studies) subjects; (iv) cardiac adverse event (AE) reports from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phase II-IV adult <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> RCTs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>; (v) a large simple trial entitled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">Ziprasidone</z:chebi> Observational Study of Cardiac Outcomes (ZODIAC) in 18 154 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> (the only previously reported results included here); and (vi) cardiac-related AEs presented in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> post-marketing surveillance report created in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 4306 adults received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> in placebo- and active-comparator phase II-IV RCTs and had evaluable QTc data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One subject reached a QTc ≥480 ms; 33 (0.8%) had a QTc ≥450 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QTc prolongation ≥30 ms was observed in 389 subjects (9.0%); ≥60 ms in 30 (0.7%); and ≥75 ms in 12 (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo-controlled studies, mean change in QTc from baseline to end of study was 3.6 (± 20.8) ms in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> group; the corresponding QTc change in the pooled placebo group was -0.3 (± 20.6) ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data from IM studies, and bipolar studies in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> was used adjunctively with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>, valproate or lamotrigine, demonstrated similar QTc effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A scatter-plot of QTc prolongation against baseline QTc showed QTc prolongation ≥60 ms exclusively in adult subjects with a baseline QTc ≤400 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The final concentration-response analysis model, comprising 2966 data points from 1040 subjects, estimates an increase in QTc of 6 ms for each 100 ng/mL increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The large simple trial (ZODIAC) failed to show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> is associated with an elevated risk of non-suicidal mortality relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7735">olanzapine</z:chebi> in real-world use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Post-marketing data over a 5-year period did not show a signal of increased cardiac AEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These analyses provide the first comprehensive summary of QTc changes associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> based on Pfizer-sponsored phase II-IV RCTs, safety reports and post-marketing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results of the analyses of pooled data from phase II-IV RCTs in adults demonstrate a modest mean increase in QTc, infrequent QTc prolongation ≥60 ms (&lt;1.0%) and rare observation of QTc ≥480 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with results from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> clinical pharmacology studies, safety reports and post-marketing surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Taken together, they provide the most comprehensive evidence published to date that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> appears to be safe when used as indicated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
