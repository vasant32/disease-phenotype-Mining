<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher cardiovascular risk has also been correlated with vertebral fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the association between osteoporotic vertebral fracture and the possibly higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk, and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture were identified (n = 380) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls per case (comparison group, n = 3795) were chosen from a nationwide representative cohort of 999,997 people from 1998 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both groups were followed-up for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events for 3 years, matched by propensity scores with adjustments for covariates such as comorbidities (ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart diseases</z:e>) and exposure to medications (ie, aspirin, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering drug, or nitrates), and assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture group (37.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.5-51.2) was significantly higher than in the comparison group (14.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 12.0-16.4, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was more likely to occur in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (crude hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.89-3.79, p &lt; 0.001; adjusted HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ie, both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and require <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
