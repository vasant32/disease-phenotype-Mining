<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doppler studies of fetal cardiac tissue movements, assessing cardiac movements both qualitatively and quantitatively, have recently been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a conventional high-resolution ultrasound system to obtain rhythm data from pulsed-wave tissue Doppler signals of the fetal heart in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac rhythm and in a variety of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five fetuses with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (sinus) rhythm, 45 fetuses with rhythm disturbances and two neonates (one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a conventional high-resolution ultrasound system equipped for fetal studies, but without specific tissue Doppler hardware or software, we performed pulsed-wave tissue Doppler echocardiography (PW-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi>) of atrioventricular valve ring excursions to study the atrial and ventricular mechanical actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the neonates, electrocardiograms were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PW-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses shows a typical pattern of tissue motion parallel to the long axis of the heart and in the opposite direction to the blood flow, both in systole and diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This pattern is easily obtained from the tricuspid valve annulus in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm and shows characteristic changes in various fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PW-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27841">TDE</z:chebi> of atrioventricular valve annulus movement patterns may prove to be a valuable additional tool for assessing fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
