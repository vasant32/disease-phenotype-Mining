<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging of cardiac electric activities associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> plays an important role in better our understanding of the mechanisms and optimizing the treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to rigorously validate a novel three-dimensional (3-D) cardiac electrical imaging (3-DCEI) technique with the aid of 3-D intra-cardiac mapping during paced rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in the rabbit heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body surface potentials and intramural bipolar electrical recordings were simultaneously measured in a closed-chest condition in thirteen healthy rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-site pacing and dual-site pacing were performed from ventricular walls and septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VTs and premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) were induced by intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The non-invasively imaged activation sequence correlated well with invasively measured counterparts, with a correlation coefficient of 0.72 and a relative error of 0.30 averaged over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> paced beats and NE-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and VT beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The averaged distance from imaged site of initial activation to measured site determined from intra-cardiac mapping was âˆ¼5mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These promising results suggest that 3-DCEI is feasible to non-invasively localize the origins and image activation sequence of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
