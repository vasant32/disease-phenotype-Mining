<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Losses of slaughter-weight pigs due to transport stress are both welfare and economic concerns to pork producers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historically, the HAL-1843 mutation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 1 was considered responsible for most of the losses; however, DNA testing has effectively eliminated this mutation from commercial herds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified two sibling barrows in the USMARC swine herd that died from apparent symptoms of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017301" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stress syndrome</z:e> after transport at 12 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000194'>open-mouth</z:hpo> breathing, skin discoloration, vocalization and loss of mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We repeated the original mating along with sire-daughter matings to produce additional offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 8 weeks of age, heart rate and electrocardiographs (ECG) were monitored during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia challenge (3% for 3 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four males from the original sire-dam mating and two males from a sire-daughter mating died after one minute of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals from additional litters were identified as having a stress response, sometimes resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, during regular processing and weighing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Affected animals had elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase (CPK) levels before and immediately after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> challenge and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A pedigree containing 250 pigs, including 49 affected animals, was genotyped with the Illumina PorcineSNP60 Beadchip and only one chromosomal region, SSCX at 25.1-27.7 Mb over the dystrophin gene (DMD), was significantly associated with the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An arginine to tryptophan (R1958W) polymorphism in exon 41 of DMD was the most significant marker associated with stress susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunoblots of affected heart and skeletal muscle showed a dramatic reduction of dystrophin protein and histopathology of affected hearts indicated muscle fiber degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017301" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stress syndrome</z:e> was characterized in pigs and the causative genetic factor most likely resides within DMD that results in less dystrophin protein and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> that can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> under stressful conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The identification of predictive markers will allow us to determine the prevalence of this disease in commercial swine populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This defect also provides a unique biomedical model for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> that may be superior to those available because of the similarities in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and allow advances in gene therapies for human disease </plain></SENT>
