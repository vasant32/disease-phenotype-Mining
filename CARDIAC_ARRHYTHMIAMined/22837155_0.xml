<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 50 patients who underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation and defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing: 25 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% and 25 patients with LVEF &lt;45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured cardiac biomarkers (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="7044">myoglobin</z:chebi>, cardiac troponin T and I, and N-terminal probrain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular relaxation was assessed by global longitudinal strain rate during the isovolumetric relaxation period using speckle-tracking echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood sampling and echocardiography were performed before, immediately after, and 5 minutes and 4 hours after DFT testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure was measured directly during DFT testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac biomarkers showed no significant changes in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LVEF was decreased until 5 minutes after DFT testing and had recovered to the baseline at 4 hours in the group with reduced LVEF (P&lt;0.001), whereas LVEF reduction was not observed in the group with preserved LVEF (P=0.637) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Global isovolumetric relaxation period was decreased until 5 minutes after DFT testing and had recovered to the baseline at 4 hours in both groups (preserved LVEF: 0.39 ± 0.14 versus 0.23 ± 0.13* versus 0.23 ± 0.13* versus 0.40 ± 0.13 s(-1), *P&lt;0.001 versus baseline; reduced LVEF: 0.15 ± 0.05 versus 0.08 ± 0.04† versus 0.09 ± 0.04† versus 0.15 ± 0.05 s(-1), †P&lt;0.001 versus baseline, repeated-measures ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time to recovery of mean arterial pressure to the baseline was prolonged in the group with reduced LVEF (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock transiently impairs cardiac function and hemodynamics especially in patients with systolic dysfunction, although significant tissue injury is not observed </plain></SENT>
