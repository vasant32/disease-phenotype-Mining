<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The proximity of the outflow tracts (OTs) frequently results in an overlap in surface electrocardiographic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from this anatomic region, particularly when the transition occurs in lead V3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, no reliable criteria to discriminate between a right ventricular OT (RVOT) and a left ventricular OT (LVOT) site of origin (SOO) are derived from intracardiac mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A series of 15 patients underwent ablation because of OT <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> having a V3 transition, and a septal earliest activation on the RVOT was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic and mapping data were collected to analyze accuracy in predicting the RVOT versus the LVOT SOO of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 10-ms isochronal map area in the RVOT was smaller in the RVOT SOO group (1.2 [0.4-2.1] versus 3.4 [2.4-3.9] cm2, respectively; P=0.004) and had a shorter perpendicular diameter (13 [7-17] versus 28 [20-29] mm; P=0.001) and a higher longitudinal/perpendicular axis ratio (1.04 [0.95-1.11] versus 0.49 [0.44-0.57]; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 10-ms isochronal map area&gt;2.3 cm2 predicted an LVOT origin with 85.7% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, whereas a longitudinal/perpendicular axis ratio&lt;0.8 predicted an LVOT origin with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography-derived parameters showed lower values of sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distal coronary sinus activation mapping did not permit distinction between RVOT and LVOT SOO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 10-ms isochronal map area and the longitudinal/perpendicular axis ratio accurately predict the RVOT versus the LVOT SOO in patients with OT <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, a V3 transition, and a septal earliest activation </plain></SENT>
