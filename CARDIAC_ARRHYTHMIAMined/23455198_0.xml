<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rat heart was subjected to regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 45 min and reperfusion for 180 min in vivo to mimic I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RPostC was induced by 5 min right femoral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 5 min reperfusion for 3 cycles (totally 30 min) after 15 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Delayed remote ischemic post conditioning (delayed RPostC) was induced after 10 min of cardiac reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameters including mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) release in plasma and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size were determined, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to I/R, RPostC reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and LDH release during reperfusion, the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was decreased, but no changes in delayed RPostC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specific inhibitor of KCa iberiotoxin and PKC inhibitor chelerythrine both attenuated the role of RPostC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings indicated that RPostC had a protective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Opening of KCa and activating of PKC may be involved in the mechanisms of RPostC </plain></SENT>
