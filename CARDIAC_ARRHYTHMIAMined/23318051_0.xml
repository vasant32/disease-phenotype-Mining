<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While hypoglycemic events are increasingly common in the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, HRV is part of the counter-regulation against low blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that HRV was impaired in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> in diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS/METHODS: Hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamps were performed in twelve type 2 diabetic patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and in non-diabetic subjects matched for age, sex, and weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an additional study, hypoglycemic events, induced by either a single morning dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> or physical exercise, were recorded for the subsequent 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations and electrocardiograms were continuously monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum hormone levels, hypoglycemic symptoms, and forearm blood flow were measured at defined time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Occurrence of a symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0745153" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycemic episode</z:e> (mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 3.1Â±0.4mmol/l) attenuated most of the time and frequency domain measurements in both healthy and diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of reduction of HRV parameters was significantly lower in diabetic compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">Glibenclamide</z:chebi> taken in the morning enhanced the daily number of mild hypoglycemic events compared with placebo or moderate exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, 24-h mean HRV measurements were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HRV response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> is impaired in type 2 diabetic subjects resulting in a higher than expected risk for sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> following mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
