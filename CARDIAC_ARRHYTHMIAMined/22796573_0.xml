<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pregnant mice, crossed to carry double transgenic progeny, which harbor high levels of both overexpressed subunits, exhibit the most extreme phenotype and do not deliver any double transgenic pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> and embryonic phenotype that result from K(ATP) overexpression, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and K(ATP) overexpressing embryonic cardiomyocytes were isolated, cultured and voltage-clamped using whole cell and excised patch clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole mount embryonic imaging, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and Eosin (H&amp;E) and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA) immunostaining were used to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, histology and cardiac development in K(ATP) overexpressing and WT embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double transgenic embryos developed in utero <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and 100% <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> by 11.5 days post conception (dpc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K(ATP) currents were detectable in both WT and K(ATP)-overexpressing embryonic cardiomyocytes, starting at early stages of cardiac development (9.5 dpc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to adult cardiomyocytes, WT and K(ATP)-overexpressing embryonic cardiomyocytes exhibit basal and spontaneous K(ATP) current, implying that these channels may be open and active under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 9.5 dpc, live double transgenic embryos demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> looping pattern, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiac structures were collapsed, probably representing failed, non-contractile chambers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, K(ATP) channels are present and active in embryonic myocytes, and overexpression causes in utero <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and results in <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the K(ATP) channel may have an important physiological role during early cardiac development </plain></SENT>
