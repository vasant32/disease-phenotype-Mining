<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and it is associated with an increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, due mainly to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> from the left atrial appendage (LAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous LAA closure is a method to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in AF without using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we report data from an Italian experience with the LAA occluder Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (<z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi>) device (Aga Medical Corporation, Plymouth, MN, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was designed to evaluate the safety of LAA closure using <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> and the efficacy of the procedure in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during a 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with permanent or paroxysmal AF, high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, and contraindication to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy were selected for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The LAA closure was attempted in 37 patients and succeeded in 34 cases (91.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients experienced serious complications (one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> requiring pericardiocentesis, two device embolizations, one low-rate response AF requiring artificial pacing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a 1-year follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in one of 34 patients, resulting in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 2.94%; thus there was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate reduction of 50.2% and 26.5% compared to the expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate, according to CHADS2 and CHA2 DS2 VASc score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients who received <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> experienced major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LAA closure using <z:chebi fb="65" ids="13534">ACP</z:chebi> is a relatively feasible procedure which can be performed by highly experienced operators to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in patients with AF, high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, and contraindication to oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
