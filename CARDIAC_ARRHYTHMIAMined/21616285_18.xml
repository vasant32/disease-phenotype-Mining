<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of flecainide in addition to conventional drug therapy in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor Ca(2+) release channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with Î²-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antiarrhythmic agent flecainide directly targets the molecular defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> by inhibiting premature Ca(2+) release and triggered beats in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data from every consecutive genotype-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patient started on flecainide at 8 international centers before December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during exercise testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients received flecainide because of exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> despite conventional (for different reasons, not always optimal) therapy (median age 25 years; range 7 to 68 years; 73% female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exercise tests comparing flecainide in addition to conventional therapy with conventional therapy alone were available for 29 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (76%) had either partial (n = 8) or complete (n = 14) suppression of exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> with flecainide (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced worsening of exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median daily flecainide dose in responders was 150 mg (range 100 to 300 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 20 months (range 12 to 40 months), 1 patient experienced implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks for polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which were associated with a low serum flecainide level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, flecainide successfully suppressed exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> for 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flecainide reduced exercise-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> not controlled by conventional drug therapy </plain></SENT>
