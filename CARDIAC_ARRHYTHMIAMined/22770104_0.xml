<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the spectrum and outcome of a Taiwanese cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp> cases were identified from our institutional database between 1995 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical chart and conducted telephone interviews with those lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 78 patients (52% male) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anomalous drainage sites were mainly supracardiac type (42.3%) and cardiac type (39.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before operation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis was found in 100% of infracardiac type, and in 69.7% of supracardiac type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 75 patients undergoing operation, the surgical mortality was 9% (7/75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (mainly of atrial origin) occurred in 35% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 68 patients who survived the first operation, 28 (41%) developed pulmonary vein restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Half of them progressed to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis, which required reintervention or resulted in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis was the most significant predictor for postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> restenosis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> re-intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the cohort, the 1-year and 5-year survivals were 78.9% and 74.2%, respectively, and the predictor for survival was again preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The surgical mortality of isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp> is now low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis not only increased the risk of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> restenosis and its reintervention, but also the overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> drainage, per se, was not associated with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> restenosis remained the most important issue after correction of <z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
