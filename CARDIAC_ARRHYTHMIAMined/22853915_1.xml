<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a critical number of cells that synchronously exhibit EADs are needed to result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> triggers and substrates in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we use mathematical modeling and computer simulations to investigate EAD synchronization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519523" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">tissue models</z:e> with random cell-to-cell variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our major observations are as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Random cell-to-cell variations in action potential duration without EAD presence do not cause large dispersion of refractoriness in well-coupled tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of phase-2 EADs, the cells may synchronously exhibit the same number of EADs or no EADs with a very small dispersion of refractoriness, or synchronize regionally to result in large dispersion of refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of phase-3 EADs, regional synchronization leads to propagating EADs, forming <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> in tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, even though the uncoupled cells exhibit either no EAD or only a single EAD, when these cells are coupled to form a tissue, more than one <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> occur at different locations and time, multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are triggered, with the foci shifting in space and time in an irregular manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> either spontaneously terminate or degenerate into reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> and spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics of the foci </plain></SENT>
