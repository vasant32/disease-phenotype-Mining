<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> in-hospital mortality predictors among rural transfer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective analyses on 2003-2005 Medicare hospital inpatient data from 5 states were conducted to compare predictors of in-hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> mortality between rural hospital transferred and nontransferred patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 9,690 rural hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients were identified: 3,087 were transferred to receiving hospitals and 6,603 were not transferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separate logistic regressions were conducted for transferred and nontransferred patient cohorts and results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfer patients were younger, more likely male, had fewer comorbidities/complications, and were less likely to expire (5.3% vs 16.7%) in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmia were the most common comorbidities/complications among transfer and no-transfer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients, but shock (OR = 9.44) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (OR = 3.67) had the strongest associations with in-hospital mortality for both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was associated with a 42% reduction in hospital mortality risk for transfer patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transfer was associated with a greater likelihood of in-hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> survival, largely but not fully explained by transfer patients being younger with fewer comorbidities/complications who are receiving advanced cardiac care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to clarify other factors that explain higher in-hospital mortality among nontransfers, such as patients' health care decision-making </plain></SENT>
