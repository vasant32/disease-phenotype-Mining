<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of G-type immunoglobulins with functional activity was previously demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> chagasic patients (CChP) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluated the profile and the arrhythmogenic effects of sera from CChP with preserved ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electrocardiography (ECG), Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 CChP were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum from each patient was characterized in isolated rabbit hearts where ECG parameters were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the total sera of the 40 CChP tested in rabbit hearts, 42.5% activated β-adrenergic receptors (Ab-β), 5% activated muscarinic receptors (Ab-M), and 30% activated both muscarinic and β-receptors (Ab-Mβ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 22.5% of the sera were not reactive (Ab-NR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ab-β patients presented more cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in exercise testing (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Holter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> appeared more than twice as often in the Ab-β group than in the Ab-NR group and in numbers similar to the Ab-Mβ group (Ab-NR: 2; Ab-β: 5; Ab-Mβ: 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced by Ab-Mβ in isolated rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with Ab-Mβ, who had longer PR intervals, were able to reversibly prolong PR when perfused in isolated rabbit heart (r² = 0.74; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of Ab-β in CChP with preserved left ventricular function led to a greater incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the patients </plain></SENT>
