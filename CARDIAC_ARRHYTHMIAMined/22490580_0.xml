<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that β-blockers can improve cardiac performance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) by reversing protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is being strongly questioned as to whether the PKA-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR2) hyper-phosphorylation is a critical regulator of SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a rabbit HF model to investigate whether β-blockers affect SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak by other potential mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided in three groups (n=7 in each group): <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>-untreated group and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak was measured by a calcium-imaging device, and the expression and activities of related proteins were evaluated by Western blotting and auto-phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>-untreated group, there was significantly increased ventricular cavity size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006673'>reduced systolic function</z:hpo>, increased SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak, reduced associated amount of FK506 binding protein 12.6 (FKBP12.6), increased expression and activity of PKA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and increased phosphorylated RyR2 phosphorylation sites (with unchanged RyR2-P2030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the treated group, there was partly increased ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function, but no prominent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak, with unchanged expression and activity of PKA, CaMKII and their RyR2 phosphorylation sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> prevented the SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak by restoring not only PKA-dependent but also CaMKII-dependent hyper-phosphorylation of RyR2, which may be one of the potential mechanisms by which β-blockers improve cardiac function and reduce the incidence of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in HF </plain></SENT>
