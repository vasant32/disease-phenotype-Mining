<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, electrocardiographic, and electrophysiologic characteristics of 6 patients who developed a decremental AP after an attempt at ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of 295 consecutive patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> who underwent radiofrequency ablation of 311 manifest APs (group A) with those of 6 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> in whom a decrementally conducting AP was detected after an attempt at ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AP ablation site in group B patients was at the coronary sinus ostium region in 3 patients, middle cardiac vein in 2 patients, and left posteroseptal region in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two bypass tracts in group A patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 in group B patients were ablated at these locations, while 249 bypass tracts in group A patients and none in group B patients were ablated elsewhere (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 patients (83%) with acquired Mahaim <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> had an AP located in the venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds for developing an acquired decremental antegrade atrioventricular AP when it was located inside the venous system were 1 in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> group B decremental APs were sensitive to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, but none in 85 group A patients (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk for developing decremental conduction after the ablation of a rapidly conducting AP is greater for APs inside the coronary venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Acquired decremental antegrade atrioventricular APs are electrophysiologically similar to de novo ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They are capable of being part of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> circuit and, therefore, should be targeted for ablation </plain></SENT>
