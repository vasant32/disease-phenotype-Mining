<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (POAF) is associated with poorer short-term and long-term outcomes after general cardiac operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a paucity of data on the impact of POAF on outcomes after isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing isolated first-time AVR between June 2001 and December 2009 was obtained from the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ASCTS) National Cardiac Surgery Database Program and a retrospective analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative characteristics, early postoperative outcome, and late survival were compared between patients in whom POAF developed and those in whom it did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Propensity score matching was performed to correct for differences between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excluding patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, isolated first-time AVR was performed in 2,065 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>POAF developed in 725 (35.1%) of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with POAF were significantly older (mean age, 72 versus 65 years; p &lt; 0.001) and presented more often with comorbidities, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the initial study population, 592 propensity-matched patient pairs were derived; the overall matching rate was 81.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the matched groups, 30-day mortality was not significantly different between the POAF and non-POAF groups (1.5% versus 1%; p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with POAF were, however, at an independently increased risk of perioperative complications, including new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, gastrointestinal complications, and 30-day readmission (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven-year mortality was not significantly different between POAF and non-POAF groups (78% versus 83%; p = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: POAF is a risk factor for short-term morbidity but is not associated with a higher rate of early or late mortality after isolated AVR </plain></SENT>
