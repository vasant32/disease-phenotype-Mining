<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inhaled long-acting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi> are the mainstay of pharmacotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the twice-daily long-acting β(2)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenoceptor agonists</z:chebi> (LABAs) salmeterol and formoterol and the once-daily LABA indacaterol are indicated for use in COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review examines current evidence for the safety of LABAs in COPD, focusing on their effect on exacerbations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched PubMed for placebo-controlled studies evaluating long-term (≥24 weeks) use of formoterol, salmeterol, or indacaterol in patients with stable COPD, published between January 1990 and September 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We summarized data relating to exacerbations and adverse events, particularly events related to COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 20 studies examined (8774 LABA-treated patients), there was no evidence of an association between LABA treatment and increased exacerbations, COPD-related adverse events, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Where analyzed as an efficacy outcome, LABA treatment was generally associated with significant or numerical reductions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">COPD exacerbations</z:e> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidences of COPD-related adverse events were similar for active and placebo treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse events typically associated with the β(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> drug class such as skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremors</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> was low (often &lt;1% of patients), and there were no reports of increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The systemic effects of β(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation, such as high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels, were considered minor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Current evidence from clinical studies of the safety and tolerability profile of LABAs supports their long-term use in COPD </plain></SENT>
