<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during electroconvulsive therapy have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most reported cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> had <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> as the initial rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EMD">Pulseless electrical activity</z:e> as an initial rhythm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during electroconvulsive therapy has never been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after inflation of pneumatic tourniquet during lower limb surgery has been reported but never following tourniquet inflation during an electroconvulsive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case involving an 81- year- old female who presented to us for an electroconvulsive therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EMD">pulseless electrical activity</z:e> immediately after electroconvulsive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was successfully resuscitated and was later found to have bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> with a complete occlusion of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The source of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was from her left lower extremity deep venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, which we believe, got dislodged intraoperatively after inflation of pneumatic tourniquet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patient not only survived the massive pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, but also showed significant improvement in her mental status compared to her pre-admission level at the time of discharge to a sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rehabilitation centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend that patients who are elderly and at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> should selectively undergo a preoperative doppler ultrasound for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, selective application of tourniquet in the upper limb, to monitor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity, would reduce the incidence of pulmonary thrombo-embolism as embolic events are significantly less from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e> of upper extremities when compared to lower extremities </plain></SENT>
