<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the development of interventional techniques and devices, transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> has been widely performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been a lack of long-term follow-up results about postoperative ECG changes of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of early and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after transcatheter closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp> with a modified double-disk occluder (MDVO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective review of 79 patients (47 males, 32 females) between September 2002 and May 2007 who underwent transcatheter closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symmetric and asymmetric <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp> occluders were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the evaluated defects ranged from 3 to 12 mm, as measured by TTE and 3 to 15 mm by left ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0010418'>PmVSD</z:mp> were treated successfully with a single procedure, resulting in a successful closure rate of 97% (77/79 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the operation, 79 patients were followed-up for a range of 10-76 months (35.3 ± 17.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this series, 11 cases of incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> and five cases of complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> occurred during the early period after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up, these issues declined in prevalence to five and four cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reversible third-degree AVB occurred during closure or after the procedure, and two of the three patients with reversible AVB received a temporary heart pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients recovered 1 h, 6 days, and 9 days later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During 10-76 months of follow-up, no complications occurred in any of the patients, including residual shunt, severe aortic valve, or <z:mp ids='MP_0006044'>tricuspid valve regurgitation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> with a modified double-disk occluder (MDVO) resulted in excellent closure rates and acceptably low <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
