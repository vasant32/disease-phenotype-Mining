<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine CGM's and electrocardiography (ECG)'s accuracy for detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e> and/or lesions in comparison with perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty (n= 40) patients with suspected or known stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were examined by CGM and resting ECG directly prior to CMRI including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> stress perfusion (ASP) and LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigators visually reading the CMRI were blinded to the CGM and ECG results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients (n= 20) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CMRI while the other half presented with either abnormal ASP and/or detectable LGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiogoniometry yielded an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity 70%) and ECG of 63% (sensitivity 35%) compared with CMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study CGM compares more favourably than ECG with the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and/or structural myocardial lesions on CMRI </plain></SENT>
