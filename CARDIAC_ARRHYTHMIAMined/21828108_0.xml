<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concomitant surgical ablation of AF is recommended in guidelines and performed in most centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The article describes the experiences in a single institution with concomitant surgical <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-based cryoablation in 115 patients using three different application techniques (epicardial left atrium, endocardial left atrium, biatrial cryo-maze) and a structured local follow-up to one year postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed cryoablation to be safe with few complications related to the ablation procedure and few <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, a complete biatrial lesion set according to the classic Cox-maze III (CM III) lesion pattern yielded a higher success rate than left atrial procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, patients in sinus or pacing rhythm, free of AF without antiarrhythmic drugs, were 27/39 (69%), 24/32 (74%) and 36/44 (82%) in the EpiLA, EndoLA and cryo-maze groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consistent prospective follow-up is essential not only for research purposes but also for assessing the local results of AF surgery in everyday practice </plain></SENT>
