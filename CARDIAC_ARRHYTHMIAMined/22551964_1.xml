<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recently, the double-switch operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> has become the procedure of choice in our institute; however, the long-term follow-up is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1983 to 2010, 90 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> underwent the double-switch operation, which comprised of an atrial switch plus intraventricular rerouting (with or without extracardiac conduits) in 72 patients (group I), and an atrial switch plus arterial switch in 18 patients (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age at operation was 7.4 years old in group I vs. 4.3 years old in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 12.9 years in group I vs. 10.9 years in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospital and late mortality, reoperation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and NYHA status were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier survival, including hospital and late mortality at 20 years, was similar (75.7% in group I vs. 83.3% in group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The freedom from reoperation was 77.6% in group I (redo-Rastelli in five patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo> resection in three, tricuspid valve replacement in one and mitral valve plasty in one) vs. 94.1% in group II (P &lt; 0.05 vs. group I; aortic valve replacement in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 57.1% in group I vs. 78.6% in group II (P &lt; 0.05 vs. group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of NYHA class I to II at outpatient clinic was similar (86% in group I vs. 86% in group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis of the double-switch operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> was acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, an atrial switch plus arterial switch could be performed with low morbidity, and it should be considered as the optimal procedure </plain></SENT>
