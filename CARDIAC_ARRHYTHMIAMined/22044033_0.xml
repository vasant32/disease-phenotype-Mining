<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a pre-procedural elevated WBC count and an elevated N/L ratio would be a predictor of development of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results-We retrieved the data for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> during PCI between 1999 to 2009 from our cath lab database (from 30,798 records), a total of 70 patients (Group I), and tabulated their WBC counts and absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts as well as N/L ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the data with a random group of age, gender, medications and pre-existing condition matched controls (n=70) (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also adjusted for amount of myocardium under jeopardy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group I had a significantly higher total WBC count (means 14,344 Vs 6852; 95% CI; p=0.0004); neutrophil count (means 75.79% Vs 58.06%; 95% CI; p&lt;0.0001) and N/L ratio (means 3.79 Vs 1.56; 95% CI; p&lt;0.0001)[means compared with t test] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Our data suggests a pre-procedural elevated WBC count, neutrophils and elevated N/L ratio are predictors of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) </plain></SENT>
