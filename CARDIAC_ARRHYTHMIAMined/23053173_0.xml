<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular (LV) lead position was evaluated by biplane coronary venograms and anterior/posterior, lateral chest X-rays in patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LV lead location could be defined in 797 of 1089 patients (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LV lead was placed at the LV apex in 110 (14%) patients, in the anterior position in 146 (18%), in the lateral position in 448 (56%), and in the posterior position in 93 (12%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for clinical covariates, lateral or posterior lead location was associated with significantly lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.85; P = 0.006] when compared with an anterior lead location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with anterior lead position had similar risk of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> as patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>)-only (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.72-1.81; P = 0.837) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the risk of mortality between posterior or lateral and anterior LV lead locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy with posterior or lateral LV lead position is associated with decreased risk of arrhythmic events in comparison with anterior lead location and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-only patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence for increased risk of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes associated with CRT </plain></SENT>
