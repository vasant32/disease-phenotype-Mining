<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our group hypothesized that a combination of polymorphisms that result in increased synaptic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release and enhanced receptor function would predispose patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> to cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of polymorphisms in adrenergic receptor-related genes on cardiovascular event-free survival in patients with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Genotyping at 3 loci (ADRB1 Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly, and NET T-182C) was performed in 83 patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively to the endpoint of cardiovascular events (mean follow-up, 45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and emergent hospitalization as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analyses were conducted based on the number of predicted risk genotypes a patient carried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ADRB1 Ser49 allele carrier, ADRB1 Arg389 allele carrier, and NET-182CC genotype were defined as the predicted risk genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular event-free survival was compared based on the number of predicted risk genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular event-free survival was significantly better in patients with fewer than 3 predicted risk genotypes than in those with 3 predicted risk genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genotyping at these 3 loci might be a useful approach for identification of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> at risk for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
