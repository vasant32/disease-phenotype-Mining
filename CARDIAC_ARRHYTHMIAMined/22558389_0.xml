<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Methods for the electrical inhibition of cardiac excitation have long been sought to control excitability and conduction, but to date remain largely impractical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-amplitude alternating current (AC) stimulation has been known to extend cardiac action potentials (APs), and has been recently exploited to terminate reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> by producing reversible conduction blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, low-amplitude currents at similar frequencies have been shown to entrain cardiac tissues by generation of repetitive APs, leading in some cases to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and hemodynamic collapse in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an inhibition method that does not lead to entrainment - irrespective of the stimulation amplitude (bound to fluctuate in an in vivo setting) - is highly desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the effects of broader amplitude and frequency ranges on the inhibitory effects of extracellular AC stimulation on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cardiomyocytes cultured on microelectrode arrays, using both sinusoidal and square waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, at sufficiently high frequencies, cardiac tissue exhibits a binary response to stimulus amplitude with either prolonged APs or no effect, thereby effectively avoiding the risks of entrainment by repetitive firing observed at lower frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate the ability to precisely define reversible local conduction blocks in beating cultures without influencing the propagation activity in non-blocked areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conduction blocks were spatiotemporally controlled by electrode geometry and stimuli duration, respectively, and sustainable for long durations (300 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of cardiac excitation induced by high-frequency AC stimulation exhibits a binary response to amplitude above a threshold frequency, enabling the generation of reversible conduction blocks without the risks of entrainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This inhibition method could yield novel approaches for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> modeling in vitro, as well as safer and more efficacious tools for in vivo cardiac mapping and radio-frequency ablation guidance applications </plain></SENT>
