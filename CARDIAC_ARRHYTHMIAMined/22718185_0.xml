<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine has not been reported to improve cardiac involvement in Becker <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (BMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: In a 22-year-old Vietnamese male with BMD, cardiac involvement became apparent at age 19 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006673'>reduced systolic function</z:hpo>, which was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 20 years, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010741'>leg edema</z:hpo>, coughing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>Dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosed and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> was successfully replaced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, ivabradine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An attempt to discontinue ivabradine and increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi> was followed by recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> and reduction of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under ivabradine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3347">candesartan</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi>, which replaced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47426">furosemide</z:chebi>, he achieved heart rates between 60 and 80 beats/min and systolic blood pressure values between 85 and 105 mmHg without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ivabradine normalizes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> and resolves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> from BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to normalization of the heart rate and remodeling of the left ventricle, ivabradine seems to also have a positive inotropic effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> of BMD patients </plain></SENT>
