<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular dysfunction increases with higher levels of injury and greater severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disordered blood pressure control after spinal cord injury (SCI) has significant ramifications as cord-injured people have an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; cardiovascular dysfunction is currently a leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among those with SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the clinical significance of abnormal cardiovascular control following SCI, this problem has been generally neglected by both the clinical and research community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> are known to prevent and delay rehabilitation, and significantly impair the overall quality of life after SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting with neurogenic shock immediately after a higher SCI, ensuing cardiovascular dysfunctions include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disordered temperature regulation accompanies these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This chapter reviews the human and animal studies that have furthered our understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular dysfunction that occurs during sexual function and exercise is elaborated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New awareness of cardiovascular dysfunction after SCI has led to progress toward inclusion of this important autonomic problem in the overall assessment of the neurological condition of cord-injured people </plain></SENT>
