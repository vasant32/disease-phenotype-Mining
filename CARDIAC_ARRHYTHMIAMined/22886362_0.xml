<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the outcome of RAI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data from patients diagnosed with this syndrome at Helsinki University Hospital between January 1976 and December of 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were studied for 32 patients (38 % girls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall survival was 22 % at a median follow-up time of 13.8 years (range 0.1-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracardiac malformations, mostly asplenic, occurred in 91 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>Cardiac defects</z:mpath> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001651'>dextrocardia</z:hpo> in 44 % and <z:mp ids='MP_0010607'>common atrioventricular valve</z:mp> in 100 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventriculoarterial discordance or double-outlet ventricle was seen in 56 and 44 % of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005160'>Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage</z:hpo> occurred in 75 % and partially anomalous venous drainage in 13 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary outflow-tract obstruction was identified in 91 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were noted in nine patients (28 %), two of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular surgery was performed in 71 % patients (N = 25), seven patients were inoperable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Biventricular repair was not possible in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During long-term follow-up there was no significant difference between the patients with total, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or partially anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (P = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RAI is one of the most severe forms of congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prognosis remains poor despite modern surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When RAI is identified during pregnancy, prenatal counseling, termination, or planning for prompt cardiac treatment after the birth is necessary </plain></SENT>
