<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevant literature has already widely discussed the correlation between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposition to atmospheric pollutants of different types and the pathogenetic events, such as the atherogenesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, The present study intends to verify this idea on a larger population exposed to different geographical conditions, comparing an agricultural village (Pachino-Siracusa) with an industrialized area (Augusta-Siracusa), both having identical sanitary services of basic importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the specific rates of hospitalizations, we compared the prevalence of cardiovasular pathologies in the resident populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These studies confirmed the negative influence of the risk factors deriving from the environmental pollutions even on the cardiovascular aging, displaying an increased rate of hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and cardiac arrhytmias in the industrialized population </plain></SENT>
