<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) possess some cardiac effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> (PX), a potent SSRI agent, on spontaneously as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> beating isolated guinea-pig atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Guinea-pig heart was rapidly removed; the auricles were dissected out in oxygenated modified Krebs solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate and force of spontaneous contractions were recorded isometrically with a photosensitive transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PX (1-16 µg/ml) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of contractions (14-70%) and contractile force (8-16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> alone (1.2 µg/ml) produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at 7.2 ± 1.5 min and <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> at 20.1 ± 3.1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with PX (4 µg/ml) significantly increased the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to 19.8 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, PX prolonged the duration of action beating from 20.1 ± 3.1 min to 43.1± 2.6 and delayed the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of contractile force by PX + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> treatment was more regular than that observed after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The above findings may the probably be due to the inhibition of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and Ca(2+) channels or autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results also suggest that PX may reduce the membrane conductance through inhibition of ionic channels to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
