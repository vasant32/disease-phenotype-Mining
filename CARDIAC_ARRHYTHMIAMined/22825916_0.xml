<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These risks include poorly controlled pain leading to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> surges that result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, strain on fresh suture lines, and potentially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the converse side, the patients frequently require titration of potent narcotic pain medicine that can lead to hypoxemia and hypercarbia in the immediate postoperative stage causing myocardial dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, the economic benefit of ultra-fast-track anesthesia is questionable and until there is a complete cost analysis that includes operating room time, cost of ultra-fast-track medications, and compares the cost of reintubation and delayed surgical operation, it is difficult to weigh in on the cost benefit advocated in the literature </plain></SENT>
