<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> (Ca(2+)) is essential in cardiac electrical activity since it is the direct activator of myofilaments, which cause contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, irregular Ca(2+) flow in the cardiac myocyte is one of the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and contractile dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this sense, the formulation of mathematical and computational models of the mammalian ventricular myocyte has played an important role in understanding cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper proposes a biophysical model for the rat cardiac myocyte in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom and provides a mathematical framework that makes computation simpler for our understanding of the complex process of excitation-contraction-relaxation (ECR), uses low-order lumped parameter of the myofilaments and Ca(2+)handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model allows the calculation of contractile force mainly based on the dynamics of Ca(2+), provides data on transient Ca(2+)andenables the analysis of the effects of drugs used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mathematical model which describes the kinetics of cytosolic Ca(2+) and dynamic cross-bridges, was implemented through nine differential equations, auxiliary equations, three 47 biophysical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each was implemented using C(++) programming and its user-friendly interface in the programming language Delphi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of each simulation were stored in a text file and its analysis was shown in a graphical interface using executable programs in Matlab(Â®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the validation model was performed by comparing both the experimental data of Ca(2+) transient and several drug tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The model satisfactorily reproduced the Ca(2+) transient, as well as the effects of drugs that cause beta-adrenergic stimulation and the inhibition of the Ca(2+) uptake mechanism (SERCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in the parameters regulating Ca(2+) entry through L-type channels produced the oscillation amplitude of the Ca(2+) transient known as the syndrome of pulses alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in parameters related to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchange has already stabilized the transient Ca(2+) and produced a decrease in amplitude of the contractile force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The simulator proved to be a tool to study and understand the mechanisms that involve the kinetics of Ca(2+) and the dynamics of cross-bridges in the unit heart muscle, as well as a tool to analyze the possible factors that may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and study the effects of drugs that are used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in general </plain></SENT>
