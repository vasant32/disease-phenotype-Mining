<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article discusses and refines the concept of desaturator phenotypes in COPD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) obtained by cluster analysis and presents a pattern of phenotypic markers that could be used as a framework for future diagnosis and research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nocturnal oxygen desaturation results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> which predispose to nocturnal cardiac dysrhythmias, PH and possibly nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, particularly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assume that in patients with COPD at least two factors play a role in PH: the severity of pulmonary impairment, and the severity of systemic nocturnal hypoxaemia due to reduced pulmonary functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Establishing a common language for future research will facilitate our understanding and management of such a disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This knowledge could lead to different pharmacological treatments and other interventions directed at specific phenotypic groups </plain></SENT>
