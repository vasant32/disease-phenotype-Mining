<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience of CIED pocket disruptions thought to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and referred to our institution for lead extraction but instead proved to be the first manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346957" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">disseminated malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Out of 1001 consecutive patients referred to our institution for transvenous lead extraction, two patients were found to have CIED pocket disruptions due to metastatic deposits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, subjects presented with increased swelling and discomfort of CIED pockets during device follow-up without any signs or symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and negative cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cause was presumed to be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as it is not uncommon for CIED pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> to be diagnosed based purely on clinical appearances of the pocket and negative cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both CIED systems were successfully extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of surgery, the scar tissue within the pockets was atypical and histological specimens were sent for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This confirmed diffuse large-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002027'>lung adenocarcinoma</z:mp> as the causes of CIED pocket disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancy</z:e> should be considered as a differential diagnosis in CIED pocket disruptions, particularly those associated with negative cultures and histological analysis of tissue specimens removed from the pocket should be considered at the time of CIED extraction </plain></SENT>
