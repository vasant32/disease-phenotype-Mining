<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To establish the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in the general population in the UK, and in those with risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The prevalence of AF on electrocardiography was established in prospectively selected groups: 3960 randomly selected from the population, aged 45+; 782 with a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>; and 1062 with a record of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were also assessed clinically and with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality was tracked for 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was found in 78 of the random population sample (2.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was 1.6% in women and 2.4% in men, rising with age from 0.2% in those aged 45-54 to 8.0% in those aged 75 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were in patients aged 75 and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 23 of the 78 (29.5%) of those in AF took <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 782 patients, 175 (22.4%) with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were in AF, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular function in 95 (54.3%) of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was found in 14 of the 244 (5.7%) of those with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 15 of the 388 (3.9%) of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 15 of the 321 (4.7%) of those with <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, and 11 of the 208 (5.3%) of diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for age and sex, mortality was 1.57 times higher for those in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is common in the elderly and those with clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening these groups would identify many with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Use of anticoagulation was low at the time of the initial assessments in the late 1990s; practice may have changed recently </plain></SENT>
