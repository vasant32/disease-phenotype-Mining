<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are five mammalian β subunits in total: β1, β1B, β2, β3, and β4, encoded by four genes: SCN1B-SCN4B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the SCN1B splice variant, β1B, the β subunits are type I topology transmembrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, β1B lacks a transmembrane domain and is a secreted protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A growing body of work shows that VGSC β subunits are multifunctional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While they do not form the ion channel pore, β subunits alter gating, voltage-dependence, and kinetics of VGSCα subunits and thus regulate cellular excitability in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to their roles in channel modulation, β subunits are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and regulate cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration. β subunits are also substrates for sequential proteolytic cleavage by secretases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An example of the multifunctional nature of β subunits is β1, encoded by SCN1B, that plays a critical role in neuronal migration and pathfinding during brain development, and whose function is dependent on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current and γ-secretase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional deletion of SCN1B results in Dravet Syndrome, a severe and intractable pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>. β subunits are emerging as key players in a wide variety of physiopathologies, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, neuropsychiatric disorders, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>. β subunits mediate multiple signaling pathways on different timescales, regulating electrical excitability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, migration, pathfinding, and transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, some β subunit functions may operate independently of α subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, β subunits perform critical roles during development and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such, they may prove useful in disease diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
