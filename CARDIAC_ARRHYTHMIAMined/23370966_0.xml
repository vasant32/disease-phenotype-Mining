<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is less clear whether HRV is associated with a first cardiovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to study the association between HRV and incident cardiovascular events in populations without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis and dose-response meta-regression of studies assessing the association between HRV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL up to December 2011 for eligible studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected studies that used the standard deviation of the normalized N-N interval (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) or high-frequency (HF) spectral component as a measure of HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were (non)fatal cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight studies with a total number of 21 988 participants were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled relative risk (RR) comparing the lowest level to the highest level of SDNN was 1.35 (95% CI 1.10, 1.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled RRs for LF and HF were 1.45 (95% CI 1.12, 1.87) and 1.32 (95% CI 0.96, 1.81), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a meta-regression, the predicted RR of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> of the 10th and 90th HRV (SDNN) percentiles compared with the 50th percentile were 1.50 (95% CI 1.22, 1.83) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.41, 1.09).CONCLUSION: In conclusion, low HRV is associated with a 32-45% increased risk of a first cardiovascular event in populations without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in SDNN of 1% results in an âˆ¼1% lower risk of fatal or non-fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
