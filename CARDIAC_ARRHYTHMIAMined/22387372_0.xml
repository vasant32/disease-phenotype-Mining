<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Na channel blockers are effective in suppressing delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in isolated Purkinje fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes lacking calsequestrin, only those Na channel blockers that also inhibit type 2 ryanodine receptor channels were effective against spontaneous Ca elevation (SCaE) and DADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that combined Na channel and type 2 ryanodine receptor channel blocker ((R)-propafenone) is more effective than a Na channel blocker (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>) in suppressing SCaE and DADs in the intact rabbit ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared (R)-propafenone (3 μmol/L) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (50 μmol/L) on SCaE and DADs by using epicardial optical mapping of intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) and membrane voltage in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SCaE and DADs were induced by rapid pacing trains and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (0.3 μmol/L) infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One arbitrary unit is equivalent to the Ca transient amplitude of paced beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCaEs were observed at the cessation of rapid pacing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hearts at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(R)-Propafenone nearly completely inhibited DADs and SCaE (0.04 arbitrary units [95% confidence interval 0.02-0.06] vs 0.23 arbitrary units [95% confidence interval 0.18-0.28] at baseline; n = 6 hearts; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> also significantly reduced the SCaE but was significantly (P &lt;.05) less effective than (R)-propafenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both drugs increased the rise time of action potential upstroke and reduced conduction velocity to a similar extent, suggesting a significant inhibition of I(Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both Na channel blockers significantly reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-induced SCaEs in the rabbit ventricles, but (R)-propafenone was significantly more effective than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that type 2 ryanodine receptor inhibition potentiates the activity of Na channel blockers against SCaE and DADs in the intact hearts </plain></SENT>
