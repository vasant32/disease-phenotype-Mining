<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> carriers experience inappropriate shocks, but the relative merits of dual- /single-chamber devices for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> discrimination still remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored possible advantages of the atrial data provided by dual-chamber implantable defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) for discrimination of real-life supraventricular/ventricular tachyarrhythmias (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>/VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 100 dual-chamber traces from 24 ICD were blindly reviewed in dual-chamber and simulated single-chamber (with/without discriminator data) reading modes by five electrophysiologists who determined chamber of origin and provided Likert-scale "confidence" ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed 1) intra/interobserver concordance; 2) diagnostic accuracy, using expert diagnoses as a reference standard; 3) ROC curves of sensitivity/specificity of "likelihood perception" scores, generated by combining chamber-of-origin diagnostic judgments with Likert-scale "confidence" ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed diagnostic accuracy of automated discrimination by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible dual-/single-chamber algorithm configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver concordance was "substantial" (modified Cohen kappa-test values for dual-/single-chamber, 0.79/0.68); intraobserver concordance "almost complete" (kappa â‰¥ 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dual-chamber mode provided best diagnostic sensitivity/specificity (99%/92%) and highest reader confidence (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area under ROC curves of sensitivity/specificity values for the "likelihood perception" score (representing electrophysiologists' perceptions of the likelihood that an episode was of ventricular origin) was highest in dual-chamber mode (0.98 vs. 0.93 for both single-chamber modes; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding automated discrimination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four dual-chamber configurations conferred 100% sensitivity (specificity values ranged 39%-88%), whereas single-chamber configurations appeared inferior (best sensitivity/specificity combination, 89%/64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Availability of the atrial channel helps in reducing inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies by providing relevant advantages in terms of both appropriate cardiologist's post-hoc discrimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>/VT (improving program tailoring) and automated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> discrimination </plain></SENT>
