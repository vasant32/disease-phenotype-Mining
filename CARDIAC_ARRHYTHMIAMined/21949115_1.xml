<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we analyzed the effect of an extreme reduction in the number of gap junction channels or in their unitary conductance on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available gap junction uncouplers have electrophysiological effects independent from their uncoupling actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, isolated hearts from Cx43(Cre-ER(T)/fl) mice treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), from Cx43KI32 mice [in which connexin (Cx)43 was replaced with Cx32], and from control animals were submitted to regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion, and spontaneous and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In additional hearts, changes in activation time and electrical impedance during global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to treatment with 4-OHT, replacement of Cx43 with Cx32 did not modify baseline activation time or electrical impedance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the number of extrasistole and ventricular tachyarrhythmias was higher in isolated hearts from Cx43KI32 and 4-OHT-treated Cx43(Cre-ER(T)/fl) animals versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals during normoxia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (12.29 ± 3.26 and 52.17 ± 22.51 vs. 3.00 ± 1.46 spontaneous tachyarrhythmias, P &lt; 0.05), and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impairment in conduction during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was steeper in isolated hearts from Cx43KI32 animals, whereas changes in myocardial impedance were attenuated during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519606" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">transgenic models</z:e>, suggesting altered cell-to-cell coupling at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both reduction of Cx43 with 4-OHT and replacement of Cx43 by less-conductive Cx32 were arrhythmogenic under normoxia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, despite no major effects on baseline electrical properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that modifications in gap junction communication silent under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions may be arrhythmogenic during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
