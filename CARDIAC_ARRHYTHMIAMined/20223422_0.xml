<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of coronary venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coronary vein <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> frequently has been reported in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular pre-excitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Coronary computed tomography angiograms of 187 patients (108 men, 79 women; mean age +/- SD, 60 +/- 12 years) were analyzed retrospectively for the presence of a focal coronary venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was defined as a focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of twice the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, any size of diverticular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cross-sectional diameters of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aneurysmal segments of the posterior interventricular vein, great cardiac vein, and coronary sinus (CS) were measured at mid-diastole, late systole, and atrial systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Student t test was used for continuous variables and contingency tables were used for categorical variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found in 19 (10%) patients (fusiform, n =16; diverticular, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common anatomic location was the posterior interventricular vein near the confluence with the CS (n = 14), followed by the great cardiac vein near the junction with the CS (n = 3), and the CS (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 9.3 +/- 1.2 mm (range, 8.1 to 11.4 mm) at mid-diastole and 10.4 +/- 1.4 mm (range, 8.5 to 12.7 mm) at late systole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSs and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the CS showed contraction during atrial systole, which may suggest atrial myocardial coverage of these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with a venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were significantly older than patients without an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (67.6 +/- 11 vs. 59 +/- 12 years, respectively; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coronary vein <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (especially the fusiform type) were seen in up to 10% of patients with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and can be well visualized on computed tomography angiograms </plain></SENT>
