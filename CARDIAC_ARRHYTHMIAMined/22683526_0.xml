<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The literature shows large inconsistencies in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) responses to induced emotional states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be caused by differences in emotion induction methods, RSA quantification, and non-emotional demands of the situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 83 healthy subjects, we studied RSA responses to pictures and film fragments eliciting six different discrete emotions relative to neutral baseline stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RSA responses were quantified in the time and frequency domain and were additionally corrected for differences in mean heart rate and respiration rate, resulting in eight different RSA response measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjective ratings of emotional stimuli and facial electromyographic responses indicated that pictures and film fragments elicited the intended emotions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although RSA measures showed various emotional effects, responses were quite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and frequently nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were substantially influenced by methodological factors, in particular time vs. frequency domain response measures, correction for changes in respiration rate, use of pictures vs. film fragments, and sex of participants </plain></SENT>
