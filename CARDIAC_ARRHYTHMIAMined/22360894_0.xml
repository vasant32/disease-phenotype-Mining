<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were fed with a diet containing either n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, SSO group) or an equimolecular mixture of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs (FO group) for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hearts were perfused according to the working mode using a medium with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 5 μm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were then subjected to local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (20 min) and reperfusion (30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dietary n-3 PUFAs triggered the expected decrease in the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of cardiac <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusing the ischemic area favored the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> treatment abolished almost completely reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the FO group, but did not display anti-arrhythmic properties in the SSO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As it was indicated by measurements of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> seemed to favor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> calcium retention in the FO group, which might prevent cytosolic calcium spikes and reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the SSO group, the resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was associated with an aggravation of cellular damages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> calcium retention capacities were saturated, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was unable to increase them, making the drug inefficient in preventing reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
