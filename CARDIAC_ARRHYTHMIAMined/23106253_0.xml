<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) increases transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) and can be pro-arrhythmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk was not increased in large-scale CRT clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased TDR as measured by T(peak ) -T(end) (TpTe) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk in CRT in a single-center study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether QT interval, TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Post-CRT-D implant electrocardiograms of 128 patients (age 71.3 years ± 10.3) with at least 2 months of follow-up at our institution's device clinic (mean follow-up of 28.5 months ± 17) were analyzed for QT interval, TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was determined based on routine and directed device interrogations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was delivered in 18 patients (14%), and nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) was detected but did not require therapy in 58 patients (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who received appropriate defibrillator therapy had increased TpTe/QT ratio (0.24 ± 0.03 ms vs 0.20 ± 0.04, P = 0.0002) and increased TpTe (105.56 ± 20.36 vs 87.82 ± 22.32 ms, P = 0.002), and patients with NSVT had increased TpTe/QT ratio (0.22 ± 0.04 vs 0.20 ± 0.04, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>Increased QT interval</z:mp> was not associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for appropriate defibrillator therapy of T(p) T(e) /QT ratio ≥ 0.25 was 3.24 (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased TpTe and increased TpTe/QT ratio are associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in CRT-D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The utility of TpTe interval and TpTe/QT ratio as potentially modifiable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in CRT requires further study </plain></SENT>
