<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent theories argue that people's responsiveness to social resources is a key mechanism in this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This argument implies two hypotheses: first, high RSA should be related to decreased depressive symptoms only when social resources (social support) are available; second, utilization of available social resources (social engagement) should serve as a mechanism for the positive effects of RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test these hypotheses, we measured RSA in 131 adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants reported their social support, social engagement, and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months later, they again reported their depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants with higher RSA reported fewer depressive symptoms six months later, but only under conditions of high social support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interaction between RSA and social support in predicting depressive symptoms was fully mediated by social engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide crucial support for the idea that cardiac vagal control contributes to decreased depressive symptoms via social processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories as well as for the prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
