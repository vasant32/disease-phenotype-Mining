<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A planned sub-study of a prospective observational study of adult patients with potentially cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> who underwent evaluation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data collected included demographical, clinical, ECG, biomarker and outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome of interest was diagnostic utility of the classification system for ACS or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) at index presentation and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 7 and 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MACE included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, revascularization, cardiogenic shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and prevalent (cause of presentation) and incident (occurring within the follow-up period) MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by descriptive and receiver-operator curve analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty-eight patients were studied; 109 had MI (14.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.9-16.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 88 MACE at 7 days (13.5%, 95% CI 11.1-16.4%) and 93 MACE at 30 days (14.4%%, 95% CI 11.9-17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic performance (c-statistic) of the National Heart Foundation risk classification for ACS, MI, 7 and 30 day MACE was 0.74 for each (95% CI 0.71-0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although sensitivity of the high-risk classification for MI, 7 and 30 day MACE was high (99-100%), specificity was low (48-50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Heart Foundation risk classification shows only fair predictive performance for MI, 7 and 30 day MACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With specificity of approximately 50%, the recommendation for coronary care admission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high-risk patients is hard to justify </plain></SENT>
