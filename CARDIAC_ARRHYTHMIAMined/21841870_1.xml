<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He then developed pulseless <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which were treated with repeated direct-current shocks and intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He underwent emergency cardiac catheterization: stents were deployed in the left anterior descending coronary artery and right coronary artery, and an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe refractory cardiogenic shock and incessant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> compelled us to place a TandemHeart percutaneous left ventricular assist device 4 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's hemodynamic status stabilized, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> persisted for 36 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple doses of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> and multiple external direct-current shocks were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tried, but these measures failed to terminate the life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed a pharmacologic block of the left stellate ganglion, and this resulted in a return to sinus rhythm after 1 direct-current shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the 1st patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> to have been treated with TandemHeart support and left stellate ganglion block </plain></SENT>
