<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to screen such disease at early stage, this work attempts to develop a system approach based on registration, feature extraction using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), feature validation and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This diagnostic issue is set as a two-class pattern classification problem (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) where <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH database is considered for training, testing and clinical validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here DWT is applied to extract multi-resolution coefficients followed by registration using Pan Tompkins algorithm based R point detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, feature space is compressed using sub-band principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and statistically validated using independent sample t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the machine learning algorithms viz., Gaussian mixture model (GMM), error back propagation neural network (EBPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are employed for pattern classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results are studied and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is observed that both supervised classifiers EBPNN and SVM lead to higher (93.41% and 95.60% respectively) accuracy in comparison with GMM (87.36%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
