<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of early repolarization (ER) pattern in the 12-lead ECG, defined as elevation of the QRS-ST junction (J point) often associated with a late QRS slurring or notching (J wave), is a common finding in the general population, particularly in the inferior and precordial lateral leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In young and healthy individuals, particularly in males, blacks and athletes, this pattern has commonly been considered to represent an innocent finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, experimental studies, case reports and studies on healthy subjects surviving a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) have suggested an association between J-point elevation and/or QRS slurring in the inferior and lateral ECG leads and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in recent epidemiological studies on large general population no significant association between ER patterns and cardiac mortality was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In athletes, changes of the QRS-ST segment are frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that in a selected group of 21 young competitive athletes, without underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, who experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, the prevalence of J wave and/or QRS slurring in the inferior and lateral (V4 to V6) leads was significantly higher in cases than in 365 control athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following sport discontinuation, during the 36-month follow-up <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences did not differ between subgroups with and without J wave or QRS slurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently, other studies showed that among different patterns of ER rapidly ascending ST segment after the J point seems to be almost universally benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conflicting data regarding the prognostic role of ER patterns can be partly due to different definitions of ER used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the need for standardized methods of measurements of QRS end-J point-ST segment and for detailed definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The knowledge of the true significance in clinical setting of the various aspects of ER is still unclear and warrants prospective, long-term epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
