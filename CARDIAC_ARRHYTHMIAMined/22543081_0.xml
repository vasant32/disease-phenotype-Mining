<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this approach has been used to assess risk in humans exposed to air pollution, it has never been applied to rodent studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a single exposure to diesel exhaust (DE) would increase the risk of adverse cardiac events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> in rats undergoing a dobutamine challenge test, which can be used to mimic exercise-like stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar-Kyoto normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats implanted with radiotelemeters and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intravenous catheter were whole-body exposed to 150 μg/m3 DE for 4 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing doses of dobutamine, a β1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi>, were administered to conscious unrestrained rats 24 hr later to elicit the cardiac response observed during exercise while heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single exposure to DE potentiated the HR response of WKY and SH rats during dobutamine challenge and prevented HR recovery at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During peak challenge, DE-exposed SH rats had lower overall HR variability when compared with controls, in addition to transient ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> DE-exposed animals also had increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first evidence that rats exhibit stress-induced cardiac dysrhythmia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> sensitivity comparable to humans after a single exposure to a toxic air pollutant, particularly when in the presence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, exposure to low concentrations of air pollution can impair the heart's ability to respond to stress and increase the risk of subsequent triggered dysfunction </plain></SENT>
