<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children participated in 3 waves of data collection with a 1-year lag between each wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At T1, 128 girls and 123 boys participated (M age = 8.23 years; SD = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most important findings reveal that girls with either low RSA in conjunction with low SCL (i.e., coinhibition) at baseline or with increasing RSA and decreasing SCL in response to a challenging task (i.e., reciprocal parasympathetic activation) are susceptible to high or escalating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms, particularly in the context of marital conflict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings support the importance of concurrent examinations of environmental risk factors and physiological activity for better prediction of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
