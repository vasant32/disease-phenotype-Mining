<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and vagal activity may be important triggers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF), but it remains unknown if these associations occur more often than would be expected by chance alone because of the lack of a comparator group in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared self-reported frequency of these triggers in patients with PAF to those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive consenting patients presenting for electrophysiology procedures at a single university medical center underwent a structured interview regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twenty-three patients with a documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (133 with PAF and 90 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, patients with PAF had a 4.42 greater odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 14.44) of reporting alcohol consumption (p = 0.014) and a 2.02 greater odds (95% CI 1.02 to 4.00) of reporting vagal activity (p = 0.044) as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> trigger compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with PAF, drinking primarily beer was associated with alcohol as a trigger (odds ratio [OR] 4.49, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.28, p = 0.011), whereas younger age (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, p = 0.022) and a family history of AF (OR 5.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 27.23, p = 0.028) each were independently associated with having vagal activity provoke an episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAF and alcohol triggers were more likely to have vagal triggers (OR 10.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 101.42, p = 0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, alcohol consumption and vagal activity elicit PAF significantly more often than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alcohol and vagal triggers often were found in the same patients with PAF, raising the possibility that alcohol may precipitate AF by vagal mechanisms </plain></SENT>
