<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel bead formulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53188">verapamil hydrochloride</z:chebi> was developed comprising a combination of extrusion and spheronization to produce a relatively high drug load, followed by coating of the bead with an insoluble polymer (ethylcellulose) that contains a water soluble channeling agent (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi>), thus allowing the application of a sufficiently thick outer coating that is uniform and robust without 'shutting down' release of the relatively insoluble drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The new formulation provided the unexpected benefit that by adjusting both coating thickness and ethylcellulose/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="17716">lactose</z:chebi> ratio, it is possible to obtain essentially non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> sensitive and approximately zero-order drug release up to 14 hours in either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> or two pH media, at stirring speeds of either 75 or 200 rpm with either the USP basket or USP paddle stirring method </plain></SENT>
