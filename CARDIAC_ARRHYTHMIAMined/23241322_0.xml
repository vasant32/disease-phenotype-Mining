<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to distinguish the influence of cell-cell coupling between myocytes and MSCs from that of MSC-derived paracrine factors on the spontaneous activity and conduction velocity (θ) of multicellular cardiomyocyte preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cells were plated on microelectrode arrays and their spontaneous activity and θ was determined from field potential recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In heterocellular cultures of MSCs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cells the beating frequency was attenuated (t(0h): 2.26 ± 0.18 Hz; t(4h): 1.98 ± 0.26 Hz; P &lt; 0.01) concomitant to the intercellular coupling between MSCs and cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 monolayers supplemented with MSC conditioned media (ConM) or tyrode (ConT) θ significantly increased in a time-dependent manner (ConT: t(0h): 2.4 cm/s ± 0.2; t(4h): 3.1 ± 0.4 cm/s), whereas the beating frequency remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Connexin (Cx)43 mRNA and protein expression levels also increased after ConM or ConT treatment over the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation after ConT treatment implicates the Wnt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suppression of Wnt secretion from MSCs (IWP-2; 5 μmol/l) reduced the efficacy of ConT to induce phospho-LRP6 and to increase θ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of β-catenin (cardamonin; 10 μmol/l) or GSK3-α/β (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="48607">LiCl</z:chebi>; 5 mmol/l) also suppressed changes in θ, further supporting the hypothesis that MSC-mediated Cx43 upregulation occurs in part through secreted Wnt ligands and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
