<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether ghrelin administration would exert an antiarrhythmic effect via modulation of autonomic nerve activity in rats after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> following ligation of the left coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were then randomized to receive either ghrelin (n = 26) or saline (n = 26) during the period of coronary ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Power spectral analysis of heart-rate variability revealed that the administration of ghrelin increased the high-frequency (HF) power and decreased the low-frequency (LF)/HF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were less frequent in rats after MI who received ghrelin in comparison with rats that received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that rats given saline alone during MI exhibited a marked reduction in phosphorylated connexin-43 within the left ventricle, whereas those that received ghrelin displayed only minor reductions in comparison with sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects of ghrelin were diminished by the coadministration of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> or the blockade of vagal afferents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that the beneficial effect of ghrelin might be mediated by modulation of cardiac autonomic nerve activity </plain></SENT>
