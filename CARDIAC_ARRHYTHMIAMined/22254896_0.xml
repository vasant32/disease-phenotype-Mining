<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The (a) coherence between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiac oscillations in low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) band; (b) fluctuations of phase; (c) HRV and BPV as a LF power and HF power in frequency and time-frequency domain; (d) transfer function analysis of cardiovascular signals were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> was preceded by: a) lower coherence; b) increase in fluctuations of phase between signals; c) higher spectral energy associated with respiratory frequency in blood pressure signal; d) raise of sympathetic outflow to the heart; e) decreased HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was characterized mainly by an increase in LF power of blood pressure, cardiac signal and transfer function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During self-termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> a larger increased in total BPV and HRV was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that important information about both neuronal cardiovascular control and risk for spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> can be provided by combined analysis of frequency, phase, and time-frequency analysis of blood pressure and cardiac oscillation </plain></SENT>
