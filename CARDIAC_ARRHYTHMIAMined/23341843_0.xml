<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with a very clearly defined predisposition for individuals of advanced age, and this fact has led to intense study of the mechanistic links between aging and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By promoting oxidative damage to multiple subcellular and cellular structures, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to induce the intra- and extra-cellular changes necessary to promote the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the generation and accumulation of ROS have been intimately linked to the cellular processes which underlie aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review begins with an overview of AF pathophysiology, and introduces the critical structures which, when damaged, predispose an otherwise healthy atrium to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The available evidence that ROS can lead to damage of these critical structures is then reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the evidence linking the process of aging to the pathogenesis of AF is discussed </plain></SENT>
