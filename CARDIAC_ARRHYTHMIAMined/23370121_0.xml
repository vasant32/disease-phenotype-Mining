<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessment of preload responsiveness should help to define the best fluid strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial pulse pressure variation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>), which represents the amplitude of the respiratory changes in arterial pulse pressure, is considered as a marker of preload responsiveness in patients mechanically ventilated and fully adapted to their ventilator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The good ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> to predict fluid responsiveness has been confirmed in various clinical situations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, operative and post-operative periods) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there are a number of limits of using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> (e.g., spontaneous breathing activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, low tidal volume ventilation, low lung compliance), which are particularly important in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have confirmed the poor reliability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e>, ventilated according to the currently recommended lung protective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> &gt;10-12% still keeps its good predictive value, a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> (&lt;10%) is far to guarantee fluid unresponsiveness since many false-negative cases can be encountered in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, performance of alternative preload responsiveness tests such as passive leg raising or end-expiratory occlusion tests, is necessary when low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> values are measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review addresses the meaning of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, its conditions of use and its limits in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ARDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
