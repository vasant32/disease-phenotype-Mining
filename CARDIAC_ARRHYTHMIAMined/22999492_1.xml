<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Personalized computational cardiac models are emerging as an important tool for studying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms, and have the potential to become powerful instruments for guiding clinical anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we present the methodology for constructing a patient-specific model of atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> as a substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model is constructed from high-resolution late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) images acquired in vivo from a patient suffering from persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, accurately capturing both the patient's atrial geometry and the distribution of the fibrotic regions in the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atrial fiber orientation is estimated using a novel image-based method, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> is represented in the patient-specific fibrotic regions as incorporating collagenous septa, gap junction remodeling, and myofibroblast proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A proof-of-concept simulation result of reentrant circuits underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in the model of the patient's fibrotic atrium is presented to demonstrate the completion of methodology development </plain></SENT>
