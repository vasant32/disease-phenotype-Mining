<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors of this report hypothesized that by using their institution's adopted guidelines (that involve prescreening echocardiography and electrocardiography), they would detect pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> that preclude <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> administration in &lt;10% of dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 101 dogs, only 6 were excluded from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> administration based on electrocardiogram abnormalities, with a majority of those <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> classified as <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature contractions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient was excluded based on echocardiogram alone due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cardiotoxicity in treated dogs was 8% (8/101) </plain></SENT>
