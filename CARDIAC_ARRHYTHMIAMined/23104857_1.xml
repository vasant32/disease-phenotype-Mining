<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and US Food and Drug Administration website were searched for published studies up to 31 December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were considered for inclusion if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of CRT-D therapy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of this study was improvement in QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four RCTs with 1655 patients were included in this meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the QoL score of patients in CRT-D group significantly improved [weighted mean difference (WMD): -6.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): -10.56 to -1.48] compared with that in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> only group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the benefit with respect to QoL in CRT-D group was not maintained when subset meta-analysis was performed in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II (WMD: 0.19; 95% CI: -3.89 to 4.72), whereas the patients with NYHA class III-IV in CRT-D group still experienced a significant improvement of QoL score compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> group (WMD: -8.49; 95% CI: -13.39 to -3.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CRT-D therapy improves the QoL compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy alone, especially in patients with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
