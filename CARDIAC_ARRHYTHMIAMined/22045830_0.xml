<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine if sensitivity to drug-induced QT interval lengthening is enhanced in patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this multicenter, prospective study, 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter requiring conversion to sinus rhythm were enrolled: 6 patients with New York Heart Association class II to III HF (mean ejection fraction [EF], 30% ± 9%), and 9 controls (mean EF, 53% ± 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received ibutilide 1 mg intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples and 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained prior to and during 48 hours postinfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum ibutilide concentrations at 50% maximum effect on Fridericia-corrected QT (QT(F)) intervals (EC(50)) were determined, and areas under the effect (QT(F) interval vs time) curves (AUECs) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ibutilide concentration-QT(F) relationships were best described by a sigmoidal E(max) model with a hypothetical effect compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median [interquartile range] AUEC from 0 to 4 hours was larger in the HF group than in controls (1.86 [1.86-1.93] vs 1.82 [1.81-1.84] s·h; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median EC(50) was lower in the HF group (0.48 [0.46-0.49] vs 1.85 [1.10-3.23] μg/L; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to drug-induced QT interval lengthening is enhanced in patients with systolic HF, which may contribute to the increased risk of drug-induced TdP </plain></SENT>
