<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Post-infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> frequently cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Impaired myocardial conduction has previously been linked to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altered connexin expression is a potential source of conduction slowing identified in healed scar border tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional effect of increasing border-zone Cx43 has not been previously evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five Yorkshire pigs underwent anterior infarction by transient left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by weekly testing for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty animals with reproducibly inducible sustained monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were randomized 2:1:1 to receive AdCx43, AdÎ²<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">gal</z:chebi>, or no gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One week later, animals underwent follow-up electrophysiologic study and tissue assessment for several functional and molecular measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Animals receiving AdCx43 had less electrogram fractionation and faster conduction velocity in the anterior-septal border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 40% of AdCx43 animals remained inducible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, while 100% of controls were inducible after gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AdCx43 animals had 2-fold higher Cx43 protein levels in the anterior-septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border, with similar percents of phosphorylated and intercalated disk-localized Cx43 compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data mechanistically link Cx43 expression to slow conduction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility in the healed scar border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Targeted manipulation of Cx43 levels improved conduction velocity and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cx43 gene transfer represents a novel treatment strategy for post-infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
