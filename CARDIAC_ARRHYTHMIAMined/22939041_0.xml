<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) from ventricular tachyarrhythmias accounts for approximately 450,000 annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the United States; many of these cases involve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prediction of which HF patients are most susceptible to SCD is difficult, and it is uncertain whether gene polymorphisms associated with HF outcomes are also linked to arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 485 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF to see whether the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R) 1166A/C or angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphisms were associated with a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> requiring implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapies over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the correlation between polymorphisms and antitachycardia pacing (ATP) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AT1R-1166CC genotype had an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events: ATP plus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks (PÂ = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between ACE I/D genotype and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, circulating levels of microRNA-155 (miR-155), a microRNA known to posttranscriptionally regulate AT1R expression, were significantly decreased in the CC compared with the AC and AA genotypes and were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the AT1R-1166CC genotype is associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF, and the level of circulating miR-155 may be a potential marker for arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although these findings are novel, they will need replication and validation in larger cohorts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HF patients </plain></SENT>
