<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> foci in the lower RA underwent detailed atrial endocardial activation mapping and radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P-wave configuration was analysed using standard 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> originated from lower non-septal tricuspid annulus (LTA) (n = 11), coronary sinus ostium (CSo) (n = 11), lower crista terminalis (LCT) (n = 4), or lower free wall (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In leads V3-V6, PWM showed a negative pattern in at least two consecutive leads during AT originating from CSo (11/11) and LTA (9/11), with an associated sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive PWM was observed in three of four ATs originating from LCT, with an associated sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 100%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 60%, and NPV of 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A negative PWM in V3-V6 was consistent with a preferential IAC through musculature in the vicinity of the CS and an activation of both atria in an antero-posterior direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a positive PWM was associated with the engagement of a posterior (non-CS-related) interatrial connection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Characteristic PWMs in V3-V6 may accurately differentiate the anatomic sites of AT from the low RA with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> and NPVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in V3-V6 is likely to be influenced by the engagement of the preferential IAC </plain></SENT>
