<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that the plasma level of S100A12 can be used to predict outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of S100A12 in patients with stable CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 652 patients with stable CAD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and successful revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of events of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, intervention to peripheral arteries and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 973Â±639 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MACE occurred in 108 patients (16.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma S100A12 level had a significant positive correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On Kaplan-Meier curve analysis the incidence of MACE was significantly different among S100A12 quartiles (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest S100A12 quartile (Q4) had a significantly higher MACE rate than the lowest quartile (Q1) (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, hs-CRP was not significant for predicting MACE in the present subjects (P=0.074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazard model showed that S100A12 was an independent factor for predicting MACE in multivariate models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: S100A12 could be a novel biomarker for predicting cardiovascular events for predicting MACE in patients with stable CAD </plain></SENT>
