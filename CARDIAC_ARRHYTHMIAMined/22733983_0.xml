<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify pre-operative risk factors for PPM implantation after TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis (CVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 109 patients following transfemoral CVP implantation performed between 2008 and 2009 at the Leipzig Heart Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who had indwelling PPM at the time of TAVI (n = 21) were excluded, leaving 88 patients for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 80.3 ± 6.6 years and logistic EuroScore predicted risk of mortality was 23.3 ± 12.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 patients (36%) underwent PPM implantation post-TAVI during the same hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 27/88 (31%) had evidence of pre-operative abnormal conduction, including first degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and left bundle brunch block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant risk factors for the need for post-operative PPM were patient age &gt;75 years [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) 4.6], pre-operative heart rate &lt;65 beats per minute (b.p.m.; P = 0.04, OR 2.9), CVP oversizing &gt;4 mm (P = 0.03, OR 2.8), CVP prosthesis &gt;26 mm (OR 2.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (P = 0.001, OR 5.2), and ventricular rate &lt;65 b.p.m. at the first post-operative day (P = 0.137, OR 6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PPM implantation occurs frequently after transfemoral TAVI with the CVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, and larger or significantly oversized prostheses were independent risk factors for PPM implantation following TAVI with the CVP </plain></SENT>
