<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dose-adjusted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> has been the gold standard for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis in moderate- to high-risk patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy is greatly limited by its narrow therapeutic window, numerous dietary restrictions, and drug-drug interactions, and an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, great emphasis has been placed on developing a new <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> agent with fewer risks and limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current data suggest that the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is a safe and effective alternative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rivaroxaban does not require routine coagulation monitoring, which may improve patient compliance to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROCKET AF trial demonstrated that 20-mg oral rivaroxaban taken once daily was noninferior to dose-adjusted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and non-central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> and had a comparable risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based primarily on the ROCKET AF trial results, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the use of rivaroxaban for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis in patients with nonvalvular AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, additional postmarketing studies on its safety and cost effectiveness are needed before it can be widely accepted as a sound alternative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
