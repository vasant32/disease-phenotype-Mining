<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Foreign body type granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> has been reported in blood vessels of the brain, lungs, and skin of the foot following intravascular instrumentation with devices coated with hydrophilic polymer gel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of intramyocardial polymer gel emboli associated with granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> following cardiac catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Autopsy observations in a 77-year-old woman are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> requiring catheterization and coronary stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient returned with a pseudoaneurysm at the site of catheterization and shortly after suffered a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microscopically, multiple small vessels within the myocardium were noted to contain a basophilic, amorphous, focally lamellated, focally granular material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A granulomatous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> was noted in the vessels containing the foreign material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our case is the first to our knowledge to document intramyocardial vessel gel emboli following a cardiac catheterization with stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the microscopic finding of emboli within vessels does not seem to be the immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in our case, it is highly possible that it contributed to the patient's demise </plain></SENT>
