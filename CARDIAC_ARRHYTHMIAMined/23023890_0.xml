<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although there are limited data on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> overdose, it has been suggested that, in addition to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> may cause QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the high prescription rate and increasing use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi>, an understanding of its effects and treatment in overdose is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the clinical features, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review of a clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> overdoses were identified from admissions to a toxicology unit between January 2001 and May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic information, details of ingestion, clinical effects, ECG parameters [heart rate (HR), QT and QRS], <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> use and length of stay (LOS) were extracted from a clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QT was measured manually and plotted on a QT nomogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LOS was extracted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> overdoses over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 137 oxycodone overdoses, 79 (58%) ingested immediate release (IR) and 58 (42%) ingested sustained release (SR) or a combination of IR and SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median age was 40 years [interquartile range (IQR): 33-49 years], and 87 were female (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median ingested dose of IR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> was 70 mg (IQR: 40-100, range: 5-200), compared to 240 mg (IQR: 80-530, range: 30-1600) for SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">Benzodiazepines</z:chebi> were the most frequent co-ingested drug in 52 (38%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (18%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> of which five had a HR &lt; 50 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>From 116 available ECGs, the median QRS was 95 ms (IQR: 90-102 ms), and there were 20 (17%) abnormal QT-HR pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> boluses were required in 65 admissions (47%), and 34 (25%) required a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was higher overall <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> use with SR and IR + SR (32/58, 55%) compared to IR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> (33/79, 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The median LOS was 18 h (IQR: 12-35), which was greater than the median LOS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> toxicology admissions at 15 h (IQR: 8-24) over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Patients requiring a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> infusion had an even greater LOS of 36 h (IQR: 20-62 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to the expected <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the opioid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and QT prolongation in overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The SR formulation is associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> infusions and a longer LOS </plain></SENT>
