<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite of new technological breakthroughs and the understanding of the mechanisms underlying AF, based on animal models and ablation procedures in patients, the antiarrhythmic drugs remain the main therapeutic strategy to restore and maintain the sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New antiarrhythmic drugs are already available in the clinical practice and many others are under development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The new antiarrhythmic drugs have the capability to block atrial-specific ionic currents, which are involved in the maintenance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parallel, increasing evidence supports the use of compounds to regulate the arrhythmogenic atrial substrate involved in the long-term maintenance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (upstream therapies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the new antiarrhythmic drugs and upstream therapies, based on the current knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of AF </plain></SENT>
