<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>Vascular calcification</z:hpo> independently predicts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> in KTRs are few and small and have short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the evolution of coronary artery (CAC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004962'>thoracic aorta calcification</z:hpo> and their determinants in a cohort of prevalent KTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: The Agatston score of coronary arteries and thoracic aorta was measured by 16-slice spiral computed tomography in 281 KTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PREDICTORS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were recorded simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES &amp; MEASUREMENTS: The Agatston score was measured again 3.5 or more years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated analyzable computed tomographic scans were available for 197 (70%) KTRs after 4.40 Â± 0.28 years; they were not available for the rest of patients because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 40), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 1), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (n = 4), refusal (n = 35), or technical problems precluding confident calcium scoring (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CAC and aorta calcification scores increased significantly (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history of cardiovascular event, use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level were independent determinants of CAC progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Independent determinants of aorta calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score, higher pulse pressure, use of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, older age, higher serum phosphate level, use of aspirin, and male sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant regression of CAC or aorta calcification was not observed in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Cohort of prevalent KTRs with potential survival bias; few patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and nonwhites, limiting the generalizability of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous small short-term studies, we show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004934'>vascular calcification</z:hpo> progression is substantial within 4 years in prevalent KTRs and is associated with several traditional and nontraditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, some of which are modifiable </plain></SENT>
