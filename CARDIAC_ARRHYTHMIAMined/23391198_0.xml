<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated whether coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) and the degree of stenosis that were measured with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) predicted post-operative cardiovascular events in patients who were undergoing intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complications are important causes of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 239 patients underwent CTCA before intermediate-risk noncardiac surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured CACS and the degree of stenosis with CTCA and assessed clinical risk factors according to the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-operative cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> with hemodynamic compromise, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients (8%) had post-operative cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variables that correlated with the occurrence of cardiac events were RCRI (p &lt; 0.001), CACS (p &lt; 0.001), the presence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> (diameter stenosis ≥50%) (p = 0.01), and multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of CACS for prediction of cardiac events, the cutoff value was 113 (sensitivity, 0.79; specificity, 0.61; area under the curve, 0.762) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When comparing ROC curves of the combination models of RCRI, high CACS (≥113), and the presence of multivessel disease, RCRI plus high CACS, RCRI plus multivessel disease, and RCRI plus high CACS plus multivessel disease were significantly more predictable of post-operative cardiovascular events than RCRI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the pre-operative risk stratification of patients who were undergoing intermediate-risk noncardiac surgeries, CTCA evaluations showed additive value to RCRI </plain></SENT>
