<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to explore whether high Tp-e might predict mortality or fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tp-e was measured prospectively in 1359/1384 (98.2%) consecutive patients with ST elevation (n = 525) or non-ST elevation (n = 859) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> or NSTEMI) admitted for coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Tp-e was significantly correlated with age, heart rate (HR), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, LVEF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, three-vessel disease, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and QRS and QT duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years (range 0.4-2.3),109 patients (7.9%) died; 25, 45, and 39 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, nonarrhythmic cardiac causes and other causes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long Tp-e was strongly associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and Tp-e remained a significant predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in multivariable Cox analyses (RR 1.5, 95% CI[1.3-1.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HR-corrected Tp-e (cTp-e) was the strongest predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (RR 1.6 [1.4-1.9]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tp-e and cTp-e were particularly strong predictors of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RR 1.6 [1.2-2.1] and RR 1.8 [1.4-2.4]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings were similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> and NSTEMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When comparing two methods for measuring Tp-e, one including the tail of the T wave and one not, the former had markedly higher predictive power (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tp-e, and in particular cTp-e, were strong predictors of mortality during the first year post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, and should be further evaluated as prognostic factors additional to established post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
