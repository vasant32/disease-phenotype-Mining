<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: An in vivo porcine study was performed on left ventricular epicardium submerged under 10 mm of blood, using devices that mimic a 20-mm-diameter 7F circular ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Model D contained 10 separate electrodes, whereas model M consisted of 1 circular electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablations were performed at 50, 100, and 200 J with model D and at 100 J with model M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion dimensions were measured after 3-week survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> applications resulted in smooth voltage waveforms demonstrating the absence of vapor globe formation, arcing, and a pressure wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Applications up to 100 J with model D resulted in separate lesions under the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 200 J, continuous deep circular lesions were created despite the use of separate electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between applied current and median lesion depth, with a slope of 0.17 mm/A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 100 J, there was no difference in lesion depth or width between models D and M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The electrodes and ablation site directly after ablation showed no signs of thermal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an epicardial porcine model with blood around the application site, continuous circular lesions, deep enough for electric pulmonary vein isolation, were created with a single circular 200-J application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lesions were continuous despite the use of separate electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lesion depth increased with the magnitude of the application </plain></SENT>
