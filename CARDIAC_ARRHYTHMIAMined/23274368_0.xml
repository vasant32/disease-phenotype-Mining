<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both anatomic and electrical locations of the left ventricular (LV) lead have been identified as important predictors of clinical outcomes in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of LV lead location on incident device-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA), however, is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between electrical and anatomic LV lead location and device treated VAs in CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine patients undergoing CRT implantation for standard indications were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomic LV lead location was assessed by means of coronary venography and chest radiography and categorized as apical or nonapical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrical LV lead location was assessed by LV electrical delay (LVLED) and was calculated as the time between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the native QRS on the surface electrocardiogram and sensed signal on the LV lead during implantation and corrected for native QRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident appropriate device-treated VA was assessed via device interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Apical lead placement was an independent predictor of VAs (hazard ratio 5.29; 95% confidence interval 1.69-16.5; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a nonapical lead, LVLED&lt;50% native QRS was an independent predictor of VAs (hazard ratio 6.90; 95% confidence interval 1.53-31.1; P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Those with a nonapical lead and LVLEDâ‰¥50% native QRS were at substantially lower risk for first incident and recurrent VAs when compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The apical lead position is associated with an increased risk of VAs in CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a nonapical lead position, an LVLED of&lt;50% of the native QRS is associated with an increased risk of VAs </plain></SENT>
