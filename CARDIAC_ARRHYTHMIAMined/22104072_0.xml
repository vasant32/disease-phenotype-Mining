<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography (ECG) requires the application of electrodes to the skin and often necessitates undressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Capacitively coupled electrodes embedded in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chair would be a rational alternative for ECG screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the reliability and accuracy of ECG electrodes imbedded in a chair cushion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two independent clinicians compared ECG recordings obtained using skin electrodes with recordings obtained using capacitively coupled electrodes that were embedded in a chair cushion in an anesthesiology premedication room, a cardiology outpatient ward, and a cardiology day ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data to compare the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECG recordings were obtained from 107 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was accurately measured using the capacitively coupled electrodes, but motion artifacts made the identification of P and T waves unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signal quality was poor for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low body weight</z:hpo>, patients wearing clothing containing mixed fibers, and patients wearing sweaty shirts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heart rate was accurately measured, and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were correctly diagnosed using capacitive ECG electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Capacitive electrodes embedded into an examination chair are a promising tool for preoperative screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improved artifact reduction algorithms are needed before capacitive electrodes will replace skin electrodes </plain></SENT>
