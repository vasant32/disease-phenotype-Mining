<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrophysiology studies (EPS) have historically played a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recent studies point to the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) as a guide to implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of EPS use in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in the current era remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> Registry between September 2006 and March 2009 who also underwent EPS within 30 days before implant were compared to the remaining cohort to identify clinical characteristics that correlated with EPS performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were generated using hierarchical logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EPS were performed in 33,786 of 275,273 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those undergoing EPS were more likely to have had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, lack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, narrower QRS intervals, and higher EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 63.9% of EPS were performed in patients receiving primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in 46.1% of primary prevention and 54.2% of secondary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complication rates were not higher in those undergoing EPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EPS were performed predominantly in patients with borderline or less well-defined risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced from EPS were not uncommon and may help identify individuals at higher risk for future <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Efforts to better define the role of EPS in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation should be considered </plain></SENT>
