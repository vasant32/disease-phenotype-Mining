<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter closure of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the sinus of Valsalva (RAVS) using a domestic made small-waist <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> occluder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2005 and December 2010, transcatheter closure of RAVS was randomly performed in 7 patients of (43.5 ± 13.0) years old using domestic made small-waist <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> occluder in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RAVS was diagnosed by color Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of the small-waist double-disk occlude selected was 4 to 6 mm larger than the narrowest diameter of the opening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After establishment of the arteriovenous wire loop, the device was deployed by retrograde venous approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up in terms of rhythm change, residual shunt, shape of occlude, and possible valve regurgitation by echocardiography for 6 to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> RAVS were confirmed by aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aortography showed rupture of right coronary sinus into the right ventricle in 6 patients and non-coronary sinus ruptured into right ventricle in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated size of the defect was 4 to 7 (5.0 ± 1.3) mm by aortogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>Ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> was evidenced in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> defects were successfully occluded without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> received combined percutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After transcatheter RAVS occlusion, pulmonary artery systolic pressure decreased from (35.6 ± 12.7) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) to (27.4 ± 6.2) mm Hg (P &lt; 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from (21.9 ± 8.0) mm Hg to (16.1 ± 5.3) mm Hg (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>Cardiac murmur</z:mp> disappeared right after successful occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography detected a trace of residual shunt in one patient after occlusion which disappeared the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no device embolization, infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the 6 to 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of RAVS with the domestic made small-waist <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> occluder is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
