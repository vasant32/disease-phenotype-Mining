<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Higher current density at the proximal end of a six-hole catheter is not irrigated and thus could lead to uneven heating and possibly coagulum and charring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study tested a novel 12-hole irrigated catheter with six additional holes at the proximal end that provides more uniform cooling during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 188 patients (28 females, 66 ± 11 years) were treated for typical AFL at 22 sites in the USA and Canada using Cool Path Duo at 50 W and 45 °C at an irrigation rate of 13 ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to historical data from an AFL study which used a six-hole catheter with similar design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,725 RF lesions were applied in 188 patients with a mean RF duration of 18.2 ± 11.7 min per procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was achieved in 96.3 % (181 of 188) acutely and 98.3 % (173 of 176) patients at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Steam pops occurred in 0.6 % of lesions (15 of 2,725) without coagulum or charring… Compared to the six-hole irrigated tip catheter, the Cool Path Duo catheter delivered more power (33.8 ± 5.9 vs. 29.7 ± 5.2 W, p &lt; 0.0001) at a lower average tip temperature (34.7 ± 1.5 vs. 37.2 ± 2.1 °C, p &lt; 0.0001) with no statistical differences in either 3-month AFL recurrence or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cool Path Duo™ irrigated tip catheter is safe and effective in treating typical AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared to a six-hole irrigated tip catheter, the Cool Path Duo catheter delivers more power at a lower temperature </plain></SENT>
