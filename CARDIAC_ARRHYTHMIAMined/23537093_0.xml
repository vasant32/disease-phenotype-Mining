<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a well-established method for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, ECG gating problems can result in image degradation and non-diagnostic scans, particularly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A turboFLASH saturation recovery pulse sequence was used without any ECG triggering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One saturation pulse followed by 4--5 slices of undersampled radial k-space images was acquired rapidly, on the order of 40--50 msec per image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of the set of 4--5 slices was continuously repeated approximately 4 times per second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An iterative constrained reconstruction method was used to reconstruct the ungated images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ungated perfusion images were post-processed into three different sets of images (ungated, self-gated to near systole, and self-gated to near diastole) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To test the ungated approach and compare the different processing methods, 8 patients scheduled for coronary angiography underwent stress and rest perfusion imaging with the ungated acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three blinded readers assessed image quality and presence/absence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 subjects successfully completed the perfusion CMR protocol and 7/8 underwent coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during CMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall, the CMR images were of high quality as assessed by the three readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was little difference in image quality between patients in AF compared to those in sinus rhythm (3.6+/-0.7 vs. 3.3+/-0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stress/rest perfusion imaging showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion in 4 patients, fixed perfusion defects in 2 patients, and reversible perfusion defects in 2 patients, corresponding with angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pooled results from the independent readers gave a sensitivity of 0.92 (CI 0.65-0.99) and specificity of 0.92 (CI 0.65-0.99) for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> using ungated perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The same sensitivity, and a specificity of 1 (CI 0.76-1), was achieved when the images were self-gated after acquisition into near systole or near diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ungated radial dynamic perfusion CMR can give high quality imaging in patients in sinus rhythm and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this small cohort, high diagnostic accuracy was possible with this rapid perfusion imaging sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An ungated approach simplifies the acquisition and could expand the role of perfusion CMR to include patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and those with gating problems </plain></SENT>
