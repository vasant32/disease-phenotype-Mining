<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a clinical study, a novel wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder has been evaluated with regard to its ability to perform <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnostics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the ECG recorder will detect a "non-standard" ECG signal, it has been necessary to compare those signals to "standard" ECG recording signals in order to evaluate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection ability of the new system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous recording of ECG signals from both the new wireless ECG recorder and a conventional Holter recorder was compared by two independent cardiology specialists with regard to signal quality for performing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, calculated R-R intervals from the two systems were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total number of 16 patients participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It can be considered that recorded ECG signals obtained from the wireless ECG system had an acceptable quality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the patients used the wireless sensor while doing physical sport activities, and the quality of the recorded ECG signals made it possible to perform <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> diagnostics even under such conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this makes possible improvements in correlating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> to physical activities </plain></SENT>
