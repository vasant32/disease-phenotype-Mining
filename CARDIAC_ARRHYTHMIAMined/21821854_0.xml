<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated (i) gender disparities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and QoL and (ii) the magnitude of the effect of gender vs. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (III/IV), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock, and Type D personality on these outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients (n = 718; 81% men) completed the State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI) and the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) at baseline and 12 months post-implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the effect was indicated using Cohen's effect size index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of covariance for repeated measures showed no differences between men and women on mean scores of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (F((1,696)) = 2.67, P = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in QoL were observed for only two of the eight subscales of the SF-36, with women reporting poorer physical functioning (F((1,696)) = 7.14, P = 0.008) and vitality (F((1,696)) = 4.88, P = 0.028) than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, effect sizes at baseline and 12 months for gender, NYHA class, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A large effect size for Type D personality was found at both time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For QoL, at baseline and 12 months, the effect sizes for gender were small, while the influence of NYHA class and Type D personality was moderate to large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Men and women did not differ on mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> or QoL scores, except for women reporting poorer QoL on two domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative influence of gender on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and QoL was less than that of NYHA functional class and Type D personality </plain></SENT>
