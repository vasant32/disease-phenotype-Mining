<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> is a class D drug given to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, including pregnant women, but its effects on the developing heart have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some studies have suggested that this drug is safe for fetuses, they have been conducted on mothers with fetuses at or beyond six months of gestational age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_94'>valve defect</z:mpath> was positively proportional to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> concentrations over 9 μM, but not lower than 6 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ectopic overexpression of versican was observed at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001674'>atrioventricular canal</z:hpo> of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi>-treated embryos at 15 μM (EC(50)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VE-cadherin (cdh5), normally downregulated at the endocardial cushion, was also ectopically overexpressed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi>-treated embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of either versican or cdh5 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi>-treated embryos could rescue the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_94'>valve defect</z:mpath> caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: By inducing versican ectopical overexpression, leading, in turn, to cdh5 ectopical overexpression, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> treatment causes failure of cardiac valve formation in zebrafish embryos </plain></SENT>
