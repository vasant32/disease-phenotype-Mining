<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare the accuracy of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> mapping between NAVX and CARTO using a histopathologic gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A closed-chest porcine infarction model was created by circumflex <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 4 to 12 weeks, 7 subjects underwent high-density endocardial and epicardial mapping using CARTO (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California) and NAVX (St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paul, Minnesota) mapping systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After mapping, animals were euthanized and histopathologic examination was used to quantify areas of scar at depths of 1 to 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using a single-point acquisition approach with CARTO and a multipoint acquisition approach with the NAVX, endocardial and epicardial maps created using CARTO consisted of 360 ± 121 points performed in 54 ± 23 minutes/361 ± 90 points in 41 ± 13 minutes compared with 697 ± 132 points in 35 ± 8 minutes/1,303 ± 207 points in 30 ± 11 minutes using NAVX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a 2-mm depth from the endocardial and epicardial surface, the mean scar area quantified by histopathology was 9.5 ± 8.7 cm(2) and 6.2 ± 4.8 cm(2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation between histopathology and electroanatomic maps was excellent (r = 0.88, CARTO and 0.92, NAVX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Correlation between scar area determined by CARTO and NAVX was good (r = 0.88, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Balloon occlusion-reperfusion of the circumflex artery creates a localized patchy infarction in the inferolateral wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multipolar mapping achieves higher density in a shorter period of time and increases the detection of late potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation between CARTO and NAVX exists, and both systems demonstrate good correlation with histopathologic quantification of scar </plain></SENT>
