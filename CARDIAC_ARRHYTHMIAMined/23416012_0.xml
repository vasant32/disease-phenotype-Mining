<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the accuracy of a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging integration technique of the esophagus combining multislice computed tomography (CT) scan of the esophagus into the three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic map just before pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 94 consecutive patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) who underwent ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a CT performed prior procedure that was integrated to the 3D reconstruction electromechanical map of the atrium and the esophagus (Verismo(TM), EnSite® NavX version 7.0J, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical Inc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the procedure, a quadripolar electrophysiology catheter placed in the esophagus was used for mapping and to monitor esophagus position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Integrated (fusion) images were used to determinate the esophagus position compared to the left atrium posterior wall and its relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostiums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared esophagus position by CT and fusion images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success was 97.9% with no fatal complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Esophagus locations were as follows: left 57%, right 7%, oblique course 11% and central 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agreements in esophageal position between CT and fusion imaging techniques were 83.3% and 64% for patients with a recent (≤48h) and non-recent CT assessment (&gt;48h), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Throughout the procedure, esophagus stability was 88.8% (lateral displacement&lt;15mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablative strategy was modified in 51% of the cases due to awareness of esophagus location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Guidance of AF ablation with 3D fusion images was safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CT images of the esophagus, especially if acquired within 48h before ablation, ensure appropriate intraprocedural localization of the esophagus </plain></SENT>
