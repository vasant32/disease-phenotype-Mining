<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During January 2007 to December 2009, 61 cases of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with PH and 51 cases of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> without PH were admitted in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The demographic and clinical data, heart function, echocardiography and serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sex, age, vital signs, combined diseases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> as well as the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level [(103.5 ± 49.7) µmol/L vs. (90.3 ± 37.3) µmol/L, P &gt; 0.05] were similar between the two groups, while the incidence of NYHA III and IV (95% vs. 65%), the left ventricle end-systolic dimension[(71.0 ± 9.6) mm vs. (65.5 ± 7.2) mm], dimension of the left atrium [(52.8 ± 8.93) mm vs. (43.9 ± 6.3) mm], right ventricular outflow tract [(29.1 ± 5.3) mm vs. (22.1 ± 3.3) mm] incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (29/61 vs. 7/51) and the serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> level [(45.3 ± 31.8) µmol/L vs. (19.5 ± 9.08) µmol/L] were significantly higher while ejective fraction was significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with PH than those in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> without PH (0.28 ± 0.10 vs. 0.36 ± 0.10, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients with PH is linked with worse clinical features than <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients without PH </plain></SENT>
