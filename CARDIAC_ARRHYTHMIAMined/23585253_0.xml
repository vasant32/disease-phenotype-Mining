<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of remote magnetic navigation (RMN) with open-irrigated catheter vs. manual catheter navigation (MCN) in performing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched in PubMed (1948-2013) and EMBASE (1974-2013) studies comparing RMN with MCN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcomes considered were AF recurrence (primary outcome), pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), procedural complications, and data on procedure's performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and mean difference (MD) were extracted and pooled using a random-effect model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confidence in the estimates of the obtained effects (quality of evidence) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified seven controlled trials, six non-randomized and one randomized, including a total of 941 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies were at high risk of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between RMN and MCN on AF recurrence [OR 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.65, P = 0.32] or PVI (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.11-1.47, P = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remote magnetic navigation was associated with less peri-procedural complications (Peto OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.88, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean fluoroscopy time was reduced in RMN group (-22.22 min; 95% CI -42.48 to -1.96, P = 0.03), although the overall duration of the procedure was longer (60.91 min; 95% CI 31.17 to 90.65, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RMN is not superior to MCN in achieving freedom from recurrent AF at mid-term follow-up or PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The procedure implies less peri-procedural complications, requires a shorter fluoroscopy time but a longer total procedural time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the low quality of the available evidence, a proper designed randomized controlled trial could turn the direction and the effect of the dimensions explored </plain></SENT>
