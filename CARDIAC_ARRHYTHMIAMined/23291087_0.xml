<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, care protocols for these low-volume and high-risk deliveries were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elements included (1) diagnosis-specific DR care plans and algorithms, (2) a multidisciplinary team with expertise, (3) simulation, (4) checklists, and (5) debriefing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of fetal echocardiography to predict the need for specialized DR care and determine the effectiveness of the care protocols for the treatment of patients with critical CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal and postnatal medical records and echocardiograms of fetuses with CHD assigned to an advanced level of care were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety and outcome variables were analyzed to determine care plan and algorithm efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four fetuses were identified: 12 delivered at Children's National Medical Center and 22 at the adult hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004383'>hypoplastic left heart</z:hpo> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo>, d-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011659'>tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve</z:hpo>, complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001683'>ectopia cordis</z:hpo>, and conjoined twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delivery at Children's National Medical Center was associated with a shorter time to specialty care or intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures of physiologic stability and survival were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Need for specialized care was predicted in 84% of deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0004383'>hypoplastic left heart</z:hpo> syndrome, intervention was predicted in 10 of 11 deliveries and for d-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> in 10 of 12 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Care algorithms addressed most DR events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the unanticipated events, none were unrecoverable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>DR survival was 100%, and survival to discharge was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, fetal echocardiography predicted the need for specialized DR care in fetuses with critical CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Algorithm-driven protocols enable planning such that maternal and infant risk is minimized and outcomes are good </plain></SENT>
