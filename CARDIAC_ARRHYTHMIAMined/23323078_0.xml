<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reports on the determinants of morbidity in coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) have focused on outcome measures such as length of postoperative stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed that major comorbidities in the ICU hampered the prognostic effect of other weaker but important preventable risk factors with effect on patients' length of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So we aimed at evaluating postoperative length of stay in the ICU and surgical ward separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied isolated CABG candidates who were not dialysis dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classic risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using multivariate analysis, we determined the independent predictors of length of stay in the ICU and in the surgical ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Independent predictors of extended length of stay in the surgical ward ( &gt; 3 days) were a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, total administered insulin during a 24-hour period after surgery, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c), last fasting blood sugar of the patients before surgery, and inotropic usage after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was found to be 0.71 and Hosmer-Lemeshow (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) goodness of fit statistic p value was 0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of extended length of stay in the ICU ( &gt; 48 hours) were surgeon category, New York Heart Association functional class, intra-aortic balloon pump, postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, total administered insulin during a 24-hour period after surgery, and mean base excess of the first 6 postoperative hours (AUC = 0.70, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> p value = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the indices of glycemic control were the most important predictors of length of stay in the ward after cardiac surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, diabetic or non-diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, because HbA1c level did not change under the influence of perioperative events, it could be deemed a valuable measure in predicting outcome in CABG candidates </plain></SENT>
