<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study is to show the feasibility of a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>] implantation using an electroanatomic navigation system and a low dose of fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here four case reports of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, who underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: During 2010, four patients were admitted to our Cardiology Department for implantation of an CRT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> device in primary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had an ejection fraction of &lt;35% and were in New York Heart Association class III despite optimal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implantations were performed using the EnSite NavX system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the leads were positioned in the cardiac chambers utilizing the three-dimensional navigation system and only using X-ray to check that the leads had been positioned correctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, these cases are the first use of an electroanatomic system for implantation of an CRT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> device and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four cases the cannulation of the coronary sinus (CS) was performed only using the mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomic navigation made it possible to minimize X-ray exposure during the implantation of the CRT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> device; in addition, the mapping system was used to choose the optimum position of the CS catheter using as reference the maximum activation delay between the two ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NavX system shows great potential during the implantation of an CRT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It seems to be feasible, safe, and extremely beneficial in terms of a reduction in X-ray exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is benefit of more detailed information and accuracy during the CS lead placement </plain></SENT>
