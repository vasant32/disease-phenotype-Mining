<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to test the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, an agent with potent anti-inflammatory action, to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Proinflammatory processes induced by AF ablation therapy have been implicated in postablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with paroxysmal AF who received radiofrequency ablation treatment were randomized to a 3-month course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> 0.5 mg twice daily or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were measured on day 1 and on day 4 of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 3-month follow-up, recurrence of AF was observed in 27 (33.5%) of 80 patients of the placebo group versus 13 (16%) of 81 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (odds ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal side-effects were the most common symptom among patients receiving active treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> was reported in 7 patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group (8.6%) versus 1 in the placebo group (1.3%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> led to higher reductions in CRP and IL-6 levels: the median difference of CRP and IL-6 levels between days 4 and 1 was -0.46 mg/l (interquartile range: -0.78 to 0.08 mg/l) and -0.10 mg/l (-0.30 to 0.10 pg/ml), respectively, in the placebo group versus -1.18 mg/l (-2.35 to -0.46 mg/l) and -0.50 pg/ml (-1.15 to -0.10 pg/ml) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group (p &lt; 0.01 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> is an effective and safe treatment for prevention of early AF recurrences after pulmonary vein isolation in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect seems to be associated strongly with a significant decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp>, including IL-6 and CRP </plain></SENT>
