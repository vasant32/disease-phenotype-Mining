<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a new quantitative method to track interlead <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of depolarization and repolarization to detect premonitory changes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in hospitalized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Ambulatory ECGs (leads V(1), V(5), and aVF) recorded before initiation of drug therapy from patients enrolled in the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy with Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (RWH) and T-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (TWH) were assessed by second central moment analysis and T-wave alternans (TWA) by modified moving average analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 44 patients studied, 22 had experienced episodes of VT (≥4 beats at heart rates &gt;100 beats/min) following ≥120 minutes of stable sinus rhythm, and 22 were age- and sex-matched patients without VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TWA increased from 18.6±2.1 μV (baseline, mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) to 27.9±4.6 μV in lead V(5) at 15 to 30 minutes before VT (P&lt;0.05) and remained elevated until the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TWA results in leads V(1) and aVF were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RWH and TWH were elevated from 164.1±33.1 and 134.5±20.6 μV (baseline) to 299.8±54.5 and 239.2±37.0 μV at 30 to 45 minutes before VT (P&lt;0.05), respectively, preceding the crescendo in TWA by 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Matched patients without VT did not display elevated RWH (185.5±29.4 μV) or TWH (157.1±27.2 μV) during the 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This investigation is the first clinical demonstration of the potential utility of tracking depolarization and repolarization <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> to detect crescendos in electrical instability that could forewarn of impending nonsustained VT </plain></SENT>
