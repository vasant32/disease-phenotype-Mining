<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of capture and under sensing are commonly observed over time with temporary pacemaker wires, and patient mobility is restricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of an externalized permanent active-fixation pacemaker lead connected to a permanent pacemaker generator for temporary pacing may be beneficial because of improved lead stability, and greater patient mobility and comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a temporary permanent pacemaker (TPPM) system in patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction due to CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>.METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 47 patients who underwent lead extraction due to CIED <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> over a 2-year period at our centre, 23 were pacemaker dependent and underwent TPPM implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A permanent pacemaker lead was implanted in the right ventricle via the internal jugular vein and connected to a TPPM generator, which was secured externally at the base of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TPPM was used for a mean of 19.4 Â± 11.9 days (median 18 days, range 3-45 days), without loss of capture or sensing failure in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 23 patients were discharged home or to a nursing facility with the TPPM until completion of antibiotic treatment and re-implantation of a new permanent pacemaker.CONCLUSION: External TPPMs are safe and effective in patients requiring long-term pacing after infected CIED removal </plain></SENT>
