<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Structural and functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in cardiac tissue have been implicated in conduction block and arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the propensity of specific sites within the heart to initiate conduction block has not been systematically explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We utilized cardiomyocyte cultures replicating the realistic, magnetic resonance imaging-measured tissue boundaries and fibre directions of ventricular cross-sections to investigate their roles in the development of conduction block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Sprague-Dawley neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were micropatterned to obtain cultures with realistic ventricular tissue boundaries and either random or realistic fibre directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid pacing was applied at multiple sites, with action potential propagation optically mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excitation either failed at the stimulus site or conduction block developed remotely, often initiating reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of conduction block in isotropic monolayers (0% of cultures) increased with the inclusion of realistic tissue boundaries (17%) and further with realistic fibre directions (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conduction block incidence was stimulus site-dependent and highest (77%) with rapid pacing from the right ventricular (RV) free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, conduction block occurred exclusively at the insertion of the RV free wall into the septum, where structure-mediated current source-load mismatches acutely reduced wavefront and waveback velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue boundaries and sharp gradients in fibre direction uniquely determined the evolution, shape, and position of conduction block lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that specific micro- and macrostructural features of the ventricle determine the incidence and spatiotemporal characteristics of conduction block, independent of spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in ion channel expression </plain></SENT>
