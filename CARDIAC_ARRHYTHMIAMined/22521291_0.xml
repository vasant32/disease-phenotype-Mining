<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> increases ANP secretion is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-stimulated ANP secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: A perfused beating rabbit atrial model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ANP and ET-1 levels in the atrial perfusates were measured by radioimmunoassays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> (1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 μmol/L) significantly increased atrial ANP secretion in a dose-dependent manner, while the endothelin (ET)-1 levels were increased by the higher doses (3.0 and 6.0 μmol/L) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi>-increased atrial ET-1 release was blocked by PD98059 (30.0 μmol/L), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> (1.0 μmol/L), an inhibitor of L-type Ca(2+) channels, completely abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-increased ANP secretion without changing the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-induced atrial dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KB-R7943 (3.0 μmol/L), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchangers, completely blocked the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-increased atrial dynamics, but did not modulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-increased ANP secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ET-1 significantly stimulated atrial ANP release in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of ET-1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> on ANP secretion were completely blocked by BQ788 (0.3 μmol/L), an inhibitor of ET-1 type B (ET(B)) receptors, but not by BQ123 (0.3 μM), an inhibitor of ET-1 type A receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi>-increased atrial ANP secretion was blocked by PD98059 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (30.0 μmol/L), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">Ouabain</z:chebi> significantly stimulated atrial ANP secretion via an ET-1-ET(B) receptor-mediated pathway involving MAPK signaling pathway activation and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
