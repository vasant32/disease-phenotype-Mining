<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scroll waves have been observed in a variety of systems including cardiac tissue, where they are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disorganization of scroll waves into chaotic behavior is thought to be the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, whose <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> is widely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism for this process of scroll wave instability is negative filament tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was discovered in 1987 in a simple two variables model of an excitable medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since that time, negative filament tension of scroll waves and the resulting complex, often turbulent dynamics was studied in many generic models of excitable media as well as in physiologically realistic models of cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the work in this area from the first simulations in FitzHugh-Nagumo type models to recent studies involving detailed ionic models of cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the relation of negative filament tension and tissue excitability and the effects of discreteness in the tissue on the filament tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we consider the application of the negative tension mechanism to computational cardiology, where it may be regarded as a fundamental mechanism that explains differences in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in thin and thick tissue </plain></SENT>
