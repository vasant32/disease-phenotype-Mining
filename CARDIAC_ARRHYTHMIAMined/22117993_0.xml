<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations are associated with AF, including the common loss-of-function histidine-558-to-arginine (H558R) polymorphism of the human cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, voltage-gated, type V, Î± subunit (encoded by the SCN5A gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The H558R polymorphism results from the T-C transition in the SCN5A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study recruited 135 patients with AF and 296 healthy controls to scan for and perform targeted genotyping of the H558R polymorphism of the SCN5A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that the TC and CC genotypes (i.e. genotypes that result in the R558 polymorphism) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The R558 polymorphism conferred an odds ratio for AF of 3.451 (95% confidence interval 1.718, 6.931) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study provided evidence for the role of the H558R polymorphism of the SCN5A gene in increasing the susceptibility to AF </plain></SENT>
