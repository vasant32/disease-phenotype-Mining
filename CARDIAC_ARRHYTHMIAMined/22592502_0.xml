<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> is a known prognostic factor for fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and several studies have shown that the use of antidepressants can cause a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few studies, especially in Japan, have compared the effects of multiple drugs on QTc interval or examined dose relationships in a clinical setting.We compared the effects of antidepressants on QT interval, corrected to QTc by Bazett's formula, in 729 Japanese patients who were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e>.Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, we found that the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) and concomitant use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05), as well as advanced age and being female (known factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo>; both P&lt;0.01), significantly prolonged the QTc interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of individual antidepressants also revealed that the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47780">clomipramine</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05) significantly prolonged the QTc interval.Our results reveal that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi>, especially <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47780">clomipramine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi>, confer a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors investigated (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5138">fluvoxamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>) were not indicated as risk factors for QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
