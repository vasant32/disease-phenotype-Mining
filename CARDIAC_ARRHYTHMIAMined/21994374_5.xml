<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human mutations in SCN1B result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SCN1B is expressed as two developmentally regulated splice variants, β1 and β1B, that are each expressed in brain and heart in rodents and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the structure and function of β1B and investigated a novel human SCN1B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>-related mutation (p.G257R) unique to β1B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> β1B is not a transmembrane protein, but a soluble protein expressed predominantly during embryonic development that promotes neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association of β1B with voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> channels Na(v)1.1 or Na(v)1.3 is not detectable by immunoprecipitation and β1B does not affect Na(v)1.3 cell surface expression as measured by [(3)H]saxitoxin binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, β1B coexpression results in subtle alteration of Na(v)1.3 currents in transfected cells, suggesting that β1B may modulate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> current in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar to the previously characterized p.R125C mutation, p.G257R results in intracellular retention of β1B, generating a functional null allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two other SCN1B mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, p.C121W and p.R85H, are expressed at the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that β1B p.G257R may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> through a mechanism that includes intracellular retention resulting in aberrant neuronal pathfinding </plain></SENT>
