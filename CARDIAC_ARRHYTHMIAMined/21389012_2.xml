<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Several observational studies have suggested an association between high temperatures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, estimates on more specific mortality outcomes are sparse, and frequently assessed in studies using different analytical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A time series analysis was performed on 10 regions in England and Wales during the summers (June-September) of 1993-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average percentage linear increases in risk for a 1°C increase in temperature above region-specific thresholds and attributable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were computed by cause-specific mortality and age groups (0-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was evidence of increased mortality with heat for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause-of-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> groups examined, with an overall increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality of 2.1% (95% CI 1.6% to 2.6%) for a 1°C rise above the regional heat threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among main causes, the steepest increase in risk was for respiratory mortality (+4.1% (3.5% to 4.8%) per 1°C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was much smaller for cardiovascular causes (+1.8% (1.2% to 2.5%)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (+1.1% (0.7% to 1.5%)), but comparatively high for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (+5.0% (3.2% to 6.9%)) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary heart disease</z:e> (+8.3% (2.7% to 14.3%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among non- cardiorespiratory causes, the strongest effects were for genitourinary (+3.8% (2.9% to 4.7%)) and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (+4.6% (3.7% to 5.4%)) disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>33.9% of heat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were attributable to cardiovascular causes, 24.7% to respiratory causes and 41.3% to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other causes combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the risk of heat-related mortality is distributed across a wide range of different causes, and that targeting of preventative actions based on pre-existing disease is unlikely to be efficient </plain></SENT>
