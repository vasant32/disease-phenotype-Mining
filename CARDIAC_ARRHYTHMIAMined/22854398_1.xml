<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, concerns have been raised that high n-6 PUFA intake may attenuate the benefits of n-3 PUFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined associations and selected interactions between dietary fatty acids, expressed as a proportion of total fat and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 91,981 women aged 34-59 y from the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 30 y, we documented 385 SCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariable models, women in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of SFA intake had an RR of SCD of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, women in the highest compared with the lowest quintile of PUFA intake had an RR of SCD of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intakes of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were both significantly associated with a lower risk of SCD, and n-6 PUFAs did not modify the association between n-3 PUFAs and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MUFAs and trans fats were not associated with SCD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and CHD risk factors potentially in the causal pathway, the association between PUFAs and SCD remained significant, whereas the association for SFAs was no longer significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intake of PUFAs as a proportion of fat was inversely associated with SCD risk, independent of traditional CHD risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support dietary guidelines to improve dietary fat quality by replacing intake of SFAs with n-6 and n-3 PUFAs </plain></SENT>
