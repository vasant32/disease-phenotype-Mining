<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this algorithm we mainly used Hilbert-Huang transform to propose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMD</z:e> method suitable for QRS complex detection, with which the 30th signal in sddb database and the 208th signal in mit-db database could be processed, and then obtained R wave detection results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the same time, Q and S points' detection technique was analyzed with adaptive windowing technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The detection results, through proceeding R wave detection on part data of <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="55" ids="167099">BIT</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database, showed that the proposed algorithm in this paper had a very good detection effect, and that its average correct detection rate of R wave reached 99.62%, its average sensitivity of QRS complex was 98.91%, and the corresponding average specificity was 99.35% </plain></SENT>
