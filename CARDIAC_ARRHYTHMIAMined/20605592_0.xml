<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we describe our experience with an optimized technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 25 6- to 8-wk-old Yorkshire piglets, a beveled, 8 mm, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> tube graft was anastomosed to the PA and LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic pressure was maintained at &gt;60 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Saturation targets were met by adjusting a <z:chebi fb="21" ids="53251">Teflon</z:chebi> band on the graft and distal PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The target oxygen saturation (SO(2)) was 85% on a 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the SO(2) was &lt;75% on a 50% FiO(2), the graft was constricted to achieve a SO(2) â‰¥ 90% on a 100% FiO(2) and 75%-80% on a 21% FiO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications affecting mortality were neutralized with a stepwise strategy to minimize risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>, blood loss, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were determinants of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protocol optimization over time increased survival while assuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival approached 90%, with a SO(2) of 80% to 90%, 3 to 5 wk postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications included <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, excessive hypoxemia, uncontrolled shunt flow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Refinement of surgical technique, shunt adjustment via graft banding, and thrombotic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prophylaxis are the keys to success with this model </plain></SENT>
