<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the predictors of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> times and impact of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> and operative times on patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We documented operative case length, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> induction time length, and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> recovery time length in 1713 consecutive patients who underwent elective vascular surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded patient and procedure-related characteristics that might influence the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> time length, including a variable for possible July effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression was used to model the length of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the impact of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> and operative time lengths on a composite outcome of perioperative (30-d postoperative) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant predictors of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> induction time included body mass index, anesthesia type, and procedure type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant predictors of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> recovery time included operative case length, procedure type, and anesthesia type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the statistically significant covariates of total blood transfusion, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and procedure type, there was a trend for increased likelihood of the composite end point as a function of operative time (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.33; P = 0.09), which did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed no association between the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> time and composite end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modeling individually <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> induction and recovery time on the basis of operative and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> procedure characteristics is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi> and operative times do not impact perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
