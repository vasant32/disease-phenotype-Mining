<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac rhythm devices are important in the management of pediatric patients with rhythm abnormalities, although factors driving utilization are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate utilization trends, complication rates, and cost associated with device implantation in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Device implantation was analyzed using the Kids' Inpatient Database from 1997 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The type of device implantation, patient demographics, hospital characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in-hospital complications, cost, and length of stay (LOS) were analyzed. Ï‡(2) tests were used to test association between categorical variables, and logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate risk factors associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5788 hospitalizations with device implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although there was a significant increase in defibrillator implantation, there was no significant increase in the number of pacemaker implantations over this time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient- and device-related complications were relatively common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> device cohorts (pacemaker 11.2%, 7.2%; defibrillator 5.9%, 11.5%; and biventricular device 19.4%, 26.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type of complication was dependent on device type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased risk of complication was evident in the pacemaker cohort, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and other heart operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient-related complications increased cost and LOS regardless of patient or procedural characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Device implantation in patients &lt;5 years old was associated with increased LOS and cost but was not associated with increased risk of complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Device utilization in pediatrics is increasing due to escalating defibrillator implantation and biventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cost and LOS are significantly increased by patient complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduction in these complications would improve patient care and lower medical costs </plain></SENT>
