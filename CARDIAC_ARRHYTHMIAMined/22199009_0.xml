<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current technology allows 6 pacing configurations for a bipolar left ventricular (LV) lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Understanding the energy requirements for each configuration will allow optimization of pacing output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Pacing impedance, LV voltage threshold at 1.5 ms (rheobase) and 0.4 ms and chronaxie were obtained in 6 LV configurations in 49 consecutive patients undergoing CRT implantation or replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Strength-duration curves were derived using the Lapicque formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pacing impedances and voltage thresholds at 1.5 and 0.4 ms, calculated minimum threshold energy at chronaxie, current drain, energy thresholds at 0.4 ms, and strength-duration curves were statistically different between LV configurations (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest threshold energy requirements were found in Tip→right ventricular (RV) coil and Tip→Can configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Energy strength-duration curves involving the ring as the cathode (Ring→RV, Ring→Can, and Ring→Tip) had the highest LV thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pacing configuration with the lowest energy threshold correlated 89% of the time with the lowest voltage threshold at 0.4 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability to reach LV thresholds &lt;1.5 V at 0.4 ms was increased from 51% with 2 LV configurations to 67% with 6 LV configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pacing impedance, LV thresholds, minimum threshold energy at chronaxie, current drain, voltage, and energy strength-duration curves were statistically different between LV pacing configurations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LV pacing configuration with the lowest voltage threshold does not always reflects the lowest energy threshold, particularly in the presence of a low impedance configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The availability of 6 LV configurations increases the probability of optimizing LV pacing output </plain></SENT>
