<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 156 patients undergoing electrophysiological study or radiofrequency catheter ablation were prospectively assigned in a random fashion to either the femoral vein access (FVA) with a steerable curve deca-polar catheter (n= 80) or the jugular vein access (JVA) with a fixed curve deca-polar catheter (n = 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the catheterization procedures were performed by the same operator who had extensive experience in both accesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operator radiation exposure was measured with an electronic radiation dosimeter attached to the breast pocket of the operator on the outside of the lead apron and estimates of the ambient dose equivalent were derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operator radiation exposure was reduced significantly by using the FVA compared with the JVA (1.8 ± 1.3 vs. 8.6 ± 6.5 μSv; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fluoroscopy time (62.7 ± 45.8 vs. 61.9 ± 46.5 s; P = NS) and dose-area product (3.2 ± 2.3 vs. 3.1 ± 2.1 Gy cm(2); P = NS) were not statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Operator radiation exposure can be significantly reduced by using the FVA approach with a steerable curve catheter compared with the JVA approach with a fixed curve catheter, without increasing the fluoroscopy time and dose-area product </plain></SENT>
