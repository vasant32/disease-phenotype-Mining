<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is an update, expanded to include guidance on the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and advances in our knowledge in core areas since 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have updated the guidance on the design and execution of experiments and the definition, classification, quantification, and analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigators are encouraged to adopt the conventions and test their validity in the hope that this will improve uniformity and interlaboratory comparisons, aid clinical research, facilitate antiarrhythmic drug discovery and safety assessment, and improve antiarrhythmic drug deployment for different cardiac conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We note that there is a gap between some definitions proposed here and their conventional clinical counterparts, and encourage the research necessary to bridge that translational gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A web link offers the chance to vote and comment on the new conventions (https://bscr.wufoo.com/forms/z7x0x5/) </plain></SENT>
