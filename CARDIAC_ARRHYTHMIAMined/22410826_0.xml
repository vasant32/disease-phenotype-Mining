<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Throughout this time period no changes were made in the classification codes of the illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, cardiopulmonary arrest, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, psychiatric diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and the total number of calls were analyzed against 11 weather variables and the four seasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> illnesses exhibited some seasonal behavior, except <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The largest frequencies of illnesses that exhibited some association with the meteorological variables used to occur in winter, except the psychiatric cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, psychiatric diseases and the total number of calls showed significant correlations with the 11 meteorological variables considered, and the largest indices (absolute values above 0.6) were found for the former two pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other side, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> revealed no significant correlations and nearly null indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with temperature were the meteorological proxies with the largest correlations against diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pressure and humidity mostly exhibited positive correlations, which is the opposite of variables related to temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other diseases, psychiatric pathologies showed a clear predominance of positive correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the association degree of the medical dataset with recurrent patterns was further evaluated through Fourier analysis, to assess the presence of statistically significant behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the Northern Hemisphere high morbidity and mortality rates in December are usually assigned to diverse factors in relation to the holidays, but such an effect is not observed in the present analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There seems to be no clearly preferred meteorological proxy among the different types of temperatures used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is shown that the amount of occurrences depends mainly on season rather on its strength quantified by temperature </plain></SENT>
