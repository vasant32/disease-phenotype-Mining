<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the evaluation of the incidence, survival and predictors of poor outcome for OCM with delayed sternal closure (DSC), particularly with regard to parameters to determine the time of closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prolonged open chest was used in 212 of 6041 cardiac surgery patients between 2004 and 2009 (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine indications, mortality, morbidity, predictors of outcome, and parameters for timing of sternal closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of open chest (OC) was 3.5%, with 1.4% for isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 2.9% for isolated valve, and 7.1% for combined procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for OC were: hemodynamic compromise (180), intractable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (14), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (12), and cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or tamponade (six) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 153 of the 212 patients with DSC (72%) survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients died: 23 before DSC and 36 after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality could be related to the indication for OC: With the indication 'low cardiac output syndrome' (LCOS), the mortality was 36%, for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> it was 25.5%, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> 20.5%, and for tamponade on closure it was 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After DSC, deep sternal wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (DSWI) occurred in 10 patients (5.3%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282002" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superficial infection</z:e> in 4.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 18 patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (8.5%) and 27 patients with need for dialysis (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, ventricular assist device (VAD) insertion, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemodialysis, re-operation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, mean length of duration of OC (survivors 3.2 days, non-survivors 6.4 days), and longer duration of high-dose inotropic therapy could be determined as predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With our results, we could demonstrate OCM to be a beneficial, therapeutic option in patients with postoperative LCOS, massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> with hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, patients with re-operation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, need for VAD and particularly a prolonged delay before sternal closure continued to have a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
