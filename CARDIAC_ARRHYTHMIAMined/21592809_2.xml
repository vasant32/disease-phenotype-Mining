<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intra-operative device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> with transthoracic minimal invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From May 2006 to June 2009, 252 patients with secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> closure were enrolled in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups, with 182 patients in group I with intra-operative device closure and 72 in group II with surgical closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group I, the patients' age ranged from 3 months to 62 years (mean±standard deviation, 19.0±16.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach involved a transthoracic minimal invasion that was performed after full evaluation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> by transthoracic echocardiography, deploying the device through the delivery sheath to occlude the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group I, 180 patients were occluded successfully under this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the occluder device implanted ranged from 6 to 48 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor complications occurred, which included transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (n=23) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> were successfully cardiopulmonary resuscitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Another two patients with occluder dislodged back into the right atrium were turned to surgical repair with cardiopulmonary bypass on the postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group II, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were occluded successfully, and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients needed blood transfusion and suffered from various minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> discharged patients were followed up for 1-5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During this period, we found no recurrence, no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, even no device failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our comparative studies, group II had significantly longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital stay than group I (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cost for group I was less than group II (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> with transthoracic minimal invasion is a safe and feasible technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It had the advantages of cost savings, yielding better cosmetic results, and leaving less trauma than surgical closure </plain></SENT>
