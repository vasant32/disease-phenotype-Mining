<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of VT inducible with four ES is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the prognostic significance of VT inducible with the fourth ES in patients with post-myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (MI) LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients (n= 432) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> LV ejection fraction ≤40% underwent electrophysiological (EP) studies for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inducible VT ≥ 200 ms cycle length (CL) with one to four ES was considered inducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> or spontaneous VT/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>) was compared among patients with VT inducible with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of inducible VT was 37.9% (n= 164) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with inducible VT, inducibility was with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES in 24% (n= 39), 46% (n= 75), and 30% (n= 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to VT induced with less than or equal to three ES, VT induced with the fourth ES was of shorter CL (218 vs. 256 ms, P = 0.01) and more likely to be haemodynamically unstable requiring cardioversion (77 vs. 55%, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 3 years the primary endpoint occurred in 28 ± 8, 28 ± 6, and 18 ± 6% in patients with VT induced with less than or equal to two, three, and four ES, respectively (P= 0.31) and in 5 ± 2% of EP-negative patients (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> LV dysfunction, VT can be induced in a significant proportion of patients with the fourth ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These patients are at comparable risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> to patients with inducible VT with less than or equal to three ES </plain></SENT>
