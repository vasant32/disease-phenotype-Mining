<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are limited studies regarding sex differences in carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare male and female patients undergoing carotid stenting with regard to their intraprocedural complications and 30-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed patients who underwent carotid stenting between 1997 and 2007 at our tertiary centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distal protection devices were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics, risk factors, intraprocedural complications, and 30-day outcomes were compared between female and male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 243 patients who underwent 255 procedures, 67 were women (27.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) age of the female patients was 72.2 ± 8.4 years and that of the male patients was 72.0 ± 9.6 years (P = .83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>; 11 women (16.4%) and 30 men (16.0%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following intraprocedural complications were noticed in female vs male patients: asymptomatic carotid and/or iliac dissections 7.5% vs 0% (P = .001), minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 0% vs 1.1% (P = 1.00), major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 0% vs 0.5% (P = 1.00), and cardiac dysrhythmias 3% vs 2.7% (P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 30 days, the outcomes in women vs men were as follows: mortality 3.0% vs 3.2% (P = 1.00), major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 3.0% vs 2.1 % (P = .66), and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 3.0% vs 3.2% (P = 1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although minor asymptomatic intraprocedural dissections were more common in women, we did not find any impact of sex on the 30-day outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that carotid stenting can be performed as safely in women as in men </plain></SENT>
