<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A longitudinal observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The nursing homes participating in the U.L.I.S.S.E. study, a project evaluating the quality of care for older persons in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents in 31 Italian nursing homes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENT: Each resident underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at baseline, and after 6 months and 1 year by means of the RAI <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Facility characteristics were collected using an ad hoc designed questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospitalizations were self-reported by facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 170 (11.6%) of 1466 nursing home residents were admitted to the hospital at least once during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female gender and higher physician, nurse, and nursing assistant hours per resident were predictive of a lower probability to be admitted to the hospital, whereas a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo>, and polypharmacy were associated with a higher probability of being hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a reduction of hospitalization of nursing home residents could be achieved by providing an adequate amount of care and optimizing the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases and polypharmacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis should be tested in future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
