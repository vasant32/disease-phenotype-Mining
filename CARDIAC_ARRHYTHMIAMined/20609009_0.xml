<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodontal disease</z:e> are predictors of coronary heart events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis remains largely unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the relationship between root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmia in an elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Among 600 subjects, 233 who were dentate at baseline underwent a baseline examination and subsequent annual investigations, including an oral examination and a 12-lead electrocardiogram, for a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of covariance (ancova) was used to assess the number of sites with root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> between subjects with mean C-reactive protein (CRP) serum level of &lt;3.0 mg/l and those with the mean CRP serum level â‰¥3.0 mg/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess relationship between root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A high mean CRP serum level group had a significantly higher number of sites with root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> than a low CRP group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Number of sites with root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> events was significantly associated with cardiac dysrhythmia among non-smokers (odds ratio, 5.84; p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> is related to the incidence of dysrhythmias in non-smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that non-smoking elders with root <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo> lesions are at an elevated risk for dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
