<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship among AV delay, MVC, and LV isovolumic contraction using a horse model because of the low heart rate and physiologically long AV delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Six horses were evaluated during sinus rhythm, right ventricular pacing without preceding atrial contraction, and dual-chamber pacing at AV delays of 150 to 350 ms, programmed at a constant rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right parasternal 4-chamber views were recorded for simultaneous measurements of MVC from anatomic M-mode and radial tissue Doppler-based LV pre-ejection velocity and isovolumic acceleration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During sinus rhythm and long AV delays (≥300 ms), 2 positive pre-ejection velocity peaks were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first peak was identified as LV recoil during atrial relaxation and consistently preceded MVC by 33±17 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second peak was related to LV isovolumic contraction, occurring after MVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that MVC was caused by atrial relaxation and followed by true isovolumic contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During short AV delays (&lt;300 ms) and right ventricular pacing, MVC occurred significantly later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 1 pre-ejection peak was present, of which the end coincided with MVC with a mean difference of -1.5±10 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that LV contraction caused MVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Peak velocity and isovolumic acceleration were significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) because the mitral valve was open at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of LV contraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the AV delay, MVC can be atrio- or ventriculogenic, resulting in significant alterations of the LV peak pre-ejection velocity and isovolumic acceleration </plain></SENT>
