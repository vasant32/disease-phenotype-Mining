<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relevance for long-term efficacy is not well-known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated patients, who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF, or had a registered episode of AF on the 24-hour Holter 6weeks after PVI and compared it with long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF were treated with the PVAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 3-month blanking period patients who came to hospital with a documented recurrence of AF on ECG were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6weeks after procedure a 24-hour Holter was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3months patients were asked if they felt a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12months with ECG, 7-day Holter at 6 and/or 12months, and event recording if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within the blanking period, 25/100 (25%) patients had a documented recurrence of AF while 46/100 (46%) patients felt a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the blanking period up to 12months, 53/100 (53%) patients were free of AF without anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analyses revealed that absence of AF in the blanking period (OR 0.22 95%CI [0.05-0.98]) and absence of a relapse of symptoms suspect for AF during the blanking period (OR 0.21 95%CI [0.06-0.52]) were independent predictors of successful long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poor long-term outcome is strongly related to patients who experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> with ECG documented AF, AF on the 24-hour Holter at 6weeks after PVI and a relapse in the blanking period </plain></SENT>
