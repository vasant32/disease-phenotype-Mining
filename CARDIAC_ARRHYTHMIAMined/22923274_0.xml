<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) has become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between June 2010 and July 2011, 40 consecutive patients (42 ± 15 years; body mass index, 27 ± 6 kg/m(2); left ventricular ejection fraction, 47 ± 15%; 28 men) received an S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary (n=17) or secondary prevention (n=23 [58%]) at 3 institutions in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative defibrillation efficacy testing failed in 1 patient with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; testing was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> episodes stored in the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were analyzed for appropriate and inappropriate detection, as well as effective shock delivery to convert ventricular tachyarrhythmia into sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 229 (interquartile range, 116-305) days, 4 patients experienced 21 episodes, with correct detection of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and subsequent shock therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 28 shocks were delivered in these 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mixed logistic regression modeling revealed a shock efficacy of 96.4% (95% CI, 12.8%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of first shocks, however, was only 57.9% (95% CI, 35.6%-77.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four episodes were incorrectly classified as ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which led to inappropriate shock delivery in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ineffective shock delivery may occur in patients with S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, even after successful intraoperative testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multicenter trials are required with close monitoring of safety and efficacy end points to identify patients who may be at risk for shock failure </plain></SENT>
