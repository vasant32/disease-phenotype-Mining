<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present investigation was directed to compare, in one study, the cardioprotective effects of different cycles of local or remote preconditioning in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R)-induced electrophysiological, biochemical and histological changes in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned into 10 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups 1 and 2 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and I/R groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other groups were subjected to 1, 2, 3, 4 cycles of local or remote preconditioning before myocardial I/R (40 min/10 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded during I/R progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of reperfusion, plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity and total nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NO(x)) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances (TBARS), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were estimated in the heart left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was also performed to visualize the protective cellular effects of the effective cycle of local or remote preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: In general, local preconditioning was more effective than remote preconditioning in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, CK-MB release, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation and elevated MPO activity as well as preserving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concerning the most effective group in each therapy, 3 cycles of local preconditioning provided more cardioprotection than that of remote preconditioning in the histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Despite being invasive, local preconditioning provided more effective cardioprotection than remote preconditioning in ameliorating the overall electrophysiological, biochemical and histological changes </plain></SENT>
