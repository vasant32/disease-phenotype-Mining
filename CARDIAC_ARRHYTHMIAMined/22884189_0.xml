<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial in which participants were allocated to AIT, MCT, or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hospital in Trondheim, Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Adults with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 40% on optimal medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria comprised: unstable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, uncompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> within four weeks, complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, no use of Đ-blockers and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> or, any other limitation to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Randomisation of 27 patients allocated nine to each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The AIT and MCT groups completed two supervised exercise training sessions and one home training session each week for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those in AIT completed uphill treadmill walking that comprised a warm-up and cool down interspersed with 4 × 4 minute exercise intervals completed at 90-95% of peak heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intervals were separated by three minutes of walking at 50-70% of peak heart rate (total exercise time = 38 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MCT participants walked continuously for 47 minutes at 70-75% of peak heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Weekly home training comprised outdoor hill walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The control group completed 47 minutes of supervised treadmill walking at 70% of peak heart rate once every three weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes related to exercise capacity (eg, peak rate of oxygen uptake; VO(2peak)); secondary outcomes comprised measures of echocardiography and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcomes were available from 26 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The VO(2peak) achieved on completion of training was greater in the AIT group compared with the MCT group (mean difference 4.1; 95% CI 2.4 to 5.8ml/kg/min) and the control group (5.8, 95% CI 3.8 to 7.8ml/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Compared with the other groups, AIT also conferred greater gains in measures of systolic and diastolic function and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In adults with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, AIT conferred greater gains than MCT in improving aerobic capacity and measures reflecting left ventricular and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>[Mean difference and 95% CIs calculated by the CAP Editor] </plain></SENT>
