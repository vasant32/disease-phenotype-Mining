<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation reduces embolic event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates in HF patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, but if antithrombotic therapy is beneficial in patients with HF in sinus rhythm is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy and safety of oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapies (OATs) compared to antiplatelet treatment in HF patients in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEDLINE, Web of Science, CENTRAL and Scopus databases were searched up to May 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four RCTs were identified and a total of 3663 patients were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic HF were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.19) between OATs group and antiplatelet drug group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OATs have reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> risk (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.74), but have increased major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.88) compared to antiplatelet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In HF patients in sinus rhythm OATs do not show a better risk-benefit profile compared to antiplatelet treatment in cardioembolism prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin seem to be similar in reducing mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> reduces the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but increases major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible to speculate that aspirin prescription be indicated in patients with high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, whereas <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> could be preferred in patients with high thromboembolic risk </plain></SENT>
