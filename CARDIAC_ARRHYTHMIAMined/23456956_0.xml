<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aims to perform a comparative safety study assessing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> among pediatric selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using US claims data from 1997 to 2009, new pediatric (age &lt; 18 years) users of SSRI monotherapy were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adverse cardiac outcomes occurring within 12 months of SSRI initiation were identified using a previously validated International Classification of Disease, ninth edition algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to estimate the risk for each SSRI, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> as the referent group, adjusting for the propensity to receive an individual SSRI, demographics, and exposure covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the study period, 113 714 subjects met the inclusion criteria and contributed 40 639 person-years of SSRI exposure time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">Sertraline</z:chebi> (33%) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> (29%) were the most commonly prescribed SSRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty events occurred within 12 months of SSRI initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate was highest for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> (19.5/10 000 person-years) and lowest for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> (4.2/10 000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to event ranged from 45 to 86 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The adjusted risk of adverse event, relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi>, was highest for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> Hazard Ratio (HR) = 3.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-11.46) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> (HR = 3.30, 95%CI = 1.08-10.14) and lowest for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7936">paroxetine</z:chebi> (HR = 1.34, 95%CI = 0.30-5.99) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> (HR = 2.14, 95%CI = 0.75-6.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of adverse cardiac events among pediatric SSRI users was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of an adverse outcome was higher for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> users as compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5118">fluoxetine</z:chebi> users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on confirming these findings and identifying modifying risk factors to optimize medication selection for this population </plain></SENT>
