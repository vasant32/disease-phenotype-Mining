<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multifactorial pathogenesis of atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> involves resident cardiac cells as well as infiltrating leukocytes, both generating and sequestering matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a key enzyme family involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence points toward an important role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the release and activation of pro-MMPs and the stimulation of pro-fibrotic cascades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a bactericidal enzyme released from activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) is not only associated with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, but has also been shown to be mechanistically linked to atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MPO catalyzes the generation of reactive species like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">hypochlorous acid</z:chebi>, which affect intracellular signaling cascades in various cells and advance activation of pro-MMPs and deposition of atrial collagen resulting in atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, inflammatory mechanisms effectively promote atrial structural remodeling and importantly contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
