<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> increases the risk of cardiovascular complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased conduction velocity (CV), which is an independent risk factor for re-entry <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, is present in models with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ) induced type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether CV is also disturbed in models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, as a model of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and their lean controls <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16646">Zucker</z:chebi> Diabetic Lean (ZDL) rats to investigate CV and its response to the anti-arrhythmic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> analogue AAP10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gap junction remodeling was examined by immunofluorescence and western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac histomorphometry was examined by Masson`s Trichrome staining and intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation was analyzed by Bodipy staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CV was significantly slower in ZDF rats (56±1.9 cm/s) compared to non-diabetic controls (ZDL, 66±1.6 cm/s), but AAP10 did not affect CV in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total amount of Connexin43 (C×43) was identical between ZDF and ZDL rats, but the amount of lateralized C×43 was significantly increased in ZDF rats (42±12 %) compared to ZDL rats (30±8%), p&lt;0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Judged by electrophoretic mobility, C×43 phosphorylation was unchanged between ZDF and ZDL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, no differences in cardiomyocyte size or histomorphometry including <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were observed between groups, but the volume of intracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets was 4.2 times higher in ZDF compared to ZDL rats (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CV is reduced in type 2 diabetic ZDF rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CV disturbance may be partly explained by increased lateralization of C×43, but other factors are likely also involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicates that lipotoxicity potentially may play a role in development of conduction disturbances and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
