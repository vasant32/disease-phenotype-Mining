<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, 31 consecutive patients presented to the emergency room of a referral university hospital within six hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were recruited over a 3-year period (2007-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for the analysis of the effect of neutralizing antibodies to SK assays were obtained immediately on arrival at the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In-hospital and out-hospital clinical outcome defined as including return of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> after 48 hours, appearance of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after 24 hours, maximum CPK serum concentration during first three days of admission, Left Venticular Ejection Fraction (EF) on the last day of admission, surgical interventions (CABG, PTCA), re-MI and re-admission due to cardiac problems during the one-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 31 patients (7 female, 24 male with the mean age of 56.83 +/- 2.21 years) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of typical ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> 48 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, appearance of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the admission to CCU and 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, maximum CPK serum concentration during the first three days of admission, and left EF on the last day of admission were not significantly different between the two compared groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: According to this study, previous exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infections</z:e> may not reduce the efficacy of a single dose of SK and it does not seem necessary that its titer be measured before SK administration </plain></SENT>
