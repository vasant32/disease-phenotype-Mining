<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The observational study was carried out at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology/National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart Diseases</z:e>, Rawalpindi, from January 1, 2004 to March 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients electively scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who had percutaneous trans-jugular pressure monitoring catheters inserted peri-operatively were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dedicated Medtronic 3 Fr pressure monitoring catheters were passed through internal jugular vein using the modified Seldinger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up during the hospital stay for complications related to catheter insertion/removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was analysed using SPSS version 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 572 patients in the study, the catheters were ultimately positioned with the tips in the pulmonary artery in 447 (78.14%)patients, right ventricle 54 (9.44%) patients, left atrium in 52 (9.09%), and in both pulmonary artery and left atrium in 19 (3.32%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duration of pressure monitoring from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the chambers was 53 +/- 19 hours post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient and self-limiting atrial or <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular ectopic beats</z:mp> were noticed in 163 (27.58%) patients during insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Catheter was found to be non-functional in 12 (2.03%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one (0.16%) patient experienced recurrent tachyarrhythmia which required the withdrawal of catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Insertion of trans-jugular pressure monitoring catheters during cardiac surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> is a safe and reliable technique </plain></SENT>
