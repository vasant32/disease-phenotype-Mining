<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy (AAT) in these patients has significant shortcomings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) for the treatment of AF in CHD is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that PVAI for AF in patients with CHD is effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed a prospective cohort of 4315 patients (age â‰¥ 18) undergoing PVAI for drug refractory AF at a single institution and identified 36 consecutive patients with CHD (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of the aorta</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> resulting from anomalous origin of the left main coronary from the pulmonary artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second cohort of 355 consecutive patients with noncongenital structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (NSHD) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, ejection fraction &lt;50%, or prior noncongenital cardiac surgery) undergoing PVAI during the same time period was used as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as freedom from AF starting two months after PVAI in the absence AAT until the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial success was defined as freedom from AF in the presence of AAT until the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined success was defined as the sum of success and partial success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We compared the outcomes with the use of propensity-score matching in the overall cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with NSHD were older and had higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P &lt; .01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common CHD lesion was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> (61%) and the most common NSHD lesion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After one PVAI, success was achieved in 42% and 53% at 300 days in the CHD and NSHD groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four-year success was achieved in 27% and 36% in the CHD and NSHD groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the success rates between patients groups (P= .46), nor were there any differences in left atrial size or changes in ejection fraction after one or two PVAI in the respective groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complication rates between the CHD and NSHD groups were similar (15% vs. 11%, P= .42) except for a higher risk of vascular site complications in patients with CHD (8% vs. 1%, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PVAI is an attractive treatment modality in drug refractory AF in CHD, with combined success rates in excess of 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of sinus rhythm after PVAI in CHD appears similar to that of NSHD and warrants prospective validation </plain></SENT>
