<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50786">Anabolic-androgenic steroids</z:chebi> are synthetic substances derived from <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> that are employed for their trophic effect on muscle tissue, among other uses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their consumption can give trigger a series of adverse side effects on the body, including the suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis as well as liver, psychiatric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common effects are altered fat profiles and blood pressure values, cardiac remodelling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a young male, with a background of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50786">anabolic-androgenic steroids</z:chebi> abuse, who visited because of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurological focus in the right hemisphere related with an ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aetiological study, including cardiac monitoring, echocardiograph and imaging studies (magnetic resonance and arteriography) and lab findings (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, serology, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers) showed no alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association between consumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50786">anabolic-androgenic steroids</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular pathologies</z:e> is known, but its relation with cerebrovascular disease has not received so much attention from researchers </plain></SENT>
