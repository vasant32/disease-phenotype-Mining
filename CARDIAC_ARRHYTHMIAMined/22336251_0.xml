<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> (SD) and the possible changes during these past 20years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 271 patients, 205 men, 66 women aged from 12 to 88years (mean 59Â±15) were admitted after SD resuscitation outside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, 146 before 2000 (group I), 125 between 2000 and 2010 (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete check-up was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (41%) vs (37%), idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (12%) vs (11%), various <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (5%) vs (8%) were as frequent in groups I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Valvular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HDs</z:e> were more frequent in group I than II (12%) vs 6% (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities at ECG (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation syndrome</z:hpo>, conduction disturbance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or ion channel disorders) were less frequent in group I than II (8%) vs (18%) (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Drug-facilitated or related SD's did not change in groups I and II: 54 patients presented a drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp>, 16% in group I and 24% (NS) in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SD was caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, QT interval increase or conduction disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> was present in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Digoxin, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, calcium inhibitors, betablockers, antiarrhythmic drugs alone or in association were mainly implicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Drug-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> continue to explain or favour at least 20% of SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite numerous recommendations on the use of drugs, the prevalence of fatal events that may be attributed to a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drug</z:chebi> does not decrease between the years before 2000 and after 2000 </plain></SENT>
