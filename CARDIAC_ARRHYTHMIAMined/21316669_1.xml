<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess sedation-related adverse events (SRAEs), patient- and procedure-related risk factors associated with SRAEs, and endoscopist and patient satisfaction with anesthesiologist-administered sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Single-center, prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 528 consecutive patients undergoing ERCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Anesthesiologist-administered MAC or general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: SRAEs, endoscopist and patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 120 intraprocedure SRAEs during 109 of the 528 ERCPs (21% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedure SRAEs included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (38 events), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (20 events), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> desaturation to less than 85% (66 events), unplanned intubation (16 events), and procedure termination (1 event) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty postprocedure SRAEs occurred in a total of 22 patients (4% of cases), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (5 events), endotracheal intubation (2 events), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (12 events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patient-related variables associated with adverse intraprocedure events were American Society of Anesthesiologists class (P = .004) and body mass index (kg/m(2)) (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On a 10-point scale, mean endoscopist satisfaction with sedation was 9.2 (standard deviation 1.8) and patient satisfaction with sedation was 9.9 (standard deviation 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The approach to sedation was not randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class and body mass index are associated with an increased rate of cardiac and respiratory events during ERCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and respiratory events are generally minor, and MAC can be considered a safe option for most ERCP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the frequency of minor sedation-related events, procedure interruption or premature termination was rare in the setting of anesthesiologist-administered sedation </plain></SENT>
