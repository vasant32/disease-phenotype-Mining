<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac inward rectifier channels belong to three different classes of the KIR channel protein family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The KIR2.x proteins generate the classical inward rectifier current, IK1, while KIR3 and KIR6 members are responsible for the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> responsive and ATP sensitive inward rectifier currents IKAch and IKATP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant function of these channels has been correlated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, indicating their significant contribution to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A common feature of inward rectifier channels is their dependence on the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi>-4,5-bisphospate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi>) interaction for functional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) are one of the largest classes of pharmaceutical compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several widely used CADs have been associated with inward rectifier current disturbances, and recent evidence points to interference of the channel-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi> interaction as the underlying mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we will review how six of these well known drugs, used for treatment in various different conditions, interfere in cardiac inward rectifier functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, KIR channel inhibition by the anionic <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> is achieved by a different mechanism of channel-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi> interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will discuss the latest basic science insights of functional inward rectifier current characteristics, recently derived KIR channel structures and specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18348">PIP2</z:chebi>-receptor interactions at the molecular level and provide insight in how these drugs interfere in the structure-function relationships </plain></SENT>
