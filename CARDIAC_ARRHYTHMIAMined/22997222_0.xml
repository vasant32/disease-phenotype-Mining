<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Right ventricular apical pacing (RVAP) may be deleterious, determining abnormal left ventricular (LV) electrical activation and progressive LV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Permanent His-bundle pacing (HBP) has been proposed to prevent this detrimental effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare the long-term effects of HBP on LV synchrony and systolic performance with those of RVAP in the same group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our analysis included 26 patients who received both an HBP lead and an RVAP lead, as backup, in our electrophysiology laboratory between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After implantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> devices were programmed to obtain HBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An intra-patient comparison of the effects of HBP and RVAP on LV dyssynchrony and function was performed at the last available follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a mean of 34.6 ± 11 months, the pacing modality was temporarily switched to RVAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During RVAP, LV ejection fraction significantly decreased (50.1 ± 8.8% vs. 57.3 ± 8.5%, P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> significantly increased (22.5 ± 10.9% vs.16.3 ± 12.4%; P = 0.018), and inter-ventricular delay significantly worsened (33.4 ± 19.5 ms vs. 7.1 ± 4.7 ms, P = 0.003) in comparison with HBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the myocardial performance index was not statistically different between the two pacing modalities (P = 0.779) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No asynchrony was revealed by tissue Doppler imaging during HBP, while during RVAP the asynchrony index was significantly higher in both the four-chamber (125.8 ± 63.9 ms; P = 0.035 vs. HBP) and two-chamber (126 ± 86.5 ms; P = 0.037 vs. HBP) apical views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: His-bundle pacing has long-term positive effects on inter- and intra-ventricular synchrony and ventricular contractile performance in comparison with RVAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It prevents asynchronous pacing-induced LV ejection fraction <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
