<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channels mediate sinoatrial L-type currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether these channels exhibit differences in modulation and localization, which could affect their contribution to pacemaking, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized voltage-dependent facilitation (VDF) and subcellular localization of Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 channels in mouse SAN cells and determined how these properties of Ca(v)1.3 affect sinoatrial pacemaking in a mathematical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole cell Ba(2+) currents were recorded from SAN cells from mice carrying a point mutation that renders Ca(v)1.2 channels relatively insensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ca(v)1.2-mediated current was isolated in the presence of nimodipine (1 Î¼m), which was subtracted from the total current to yield the Ca(v)1.3 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With strong depolarizations (+80 mV), Ca(v)1.2 underwent significantly stronger inactivation than Ca(v)1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VDF of Ca(v)1.3 was evident during recovery from inactivation at a time when Ca(v)1.2 remained inactivated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By immunofluorescence, Ca(v)1.3 colocalized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors in sarcomeric structures while Ca(v)1.2 was largely restricted to the delimiting plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ca(v)1.3 VDF enhanced recovery of pacemaker activity after pauses and positively regulated pacemaking during slow heart rate in a numerical model of mouse SAN automaticity, including preferential coupling of Ca(v)1.3 to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that strong VDF and colocalization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptors in mouse SAN cells are unique properties that may underlie a specific role for Ca(v)1.3 in opposing abnormal slowing of heart rate </plain></SENT>
