<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi>, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or placebo for the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine RCTs met inclusion criteria and were combined using MTC models to provide direct and indirect comparisons in a single analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results are presented vs. placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> had the largest effect in reducing AF recurrence (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.16-0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> was associated with the highest rate of patients experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 2.41, 95% CI 0.96-6.06) and treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.66-5.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> was associated with the lowest rate of proarrhythmic events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> significantly reduced the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trends towards increased mortality for sotalol (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.02-11.59) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.63-7.51) were found, which were stronger when small studies randomizing &lt;100 subjects per group were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> has been demonstrated to be the most effective drug in maintaining sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Differences in outcomes between the anti-antiarrhythmic drugs were reported, with sotalol and possibly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> increasing mortality and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> possibly decreasing the incidence of serious adverse events and proarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
