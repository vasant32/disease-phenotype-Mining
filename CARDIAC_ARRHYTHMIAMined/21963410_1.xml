<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of K(2P) currents in cardiac electrophysiology remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Danio rerio (zebrafish) may be utilized to elucidate the role of cardiac K(2P) channels in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to identify and functionally characterize a zebrafish otholog of the human K(2P)10.1 channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K(2P)10.1 orthologs in the D. rerio genome were identified by database analysis, and the full zK(2P)10.1 coding sequence was amplified from zebrafish cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human and zebrafish K(2P)10.1 proteins share 61% identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High degrees of conservation were observed in protein domains relevant for structural integrity and regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>K(2P)10.1 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and currents were recorded using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Human and zebrafish channels mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> selective background currents leading to membrane hyperpolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">Arachidonic acid</z:chebi>, an activator of hK(2P)10.1, induced robust activation of zK(2P)10.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Activity of both channels was reduced by protein kinase C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar to its human counterpart, zK(2P)10.1 was inhibited by the antiarrhythmic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In summary, zebrafish harbor K(2P)10.1 two-pore-domain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels that exhibit structural and functional properties largely similar to human K(2P)10.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the zebrafish represents a valid model to study K(2P)10.1 function in vivo </plain></SENT>
