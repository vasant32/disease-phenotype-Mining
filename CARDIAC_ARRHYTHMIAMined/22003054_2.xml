<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Mas receptor is a class I G-protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in brain, testis, heart, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intracellular signaling pathways activated downstream of Mas are still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the expression pattern and signaling of Mas in the heart and assessed the participation of Mas in <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chambers of human hearts, with cardiomyocytes and coronary arteries being sites of enriched expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of Mas in either HEK293 cells or cardiac myocytes resulted in constitutive coupling to the G(q) protein, which in turn activated phospholipase C and caused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24846">inositol phosphate</z:chebi> accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To generate chemical tools for use in probing the function of Mas, we performed a library screen and chemistry optimization program to identify potent and selective nonpeptide <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and inverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mas <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> activated G(q) signaling in a dose-dependent manner and reduced coronary blood flow in isolated mouse and rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, treatment of isolated rat hearts with Mas inverse <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> improved coronary flow, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and provided cardioprotection from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury, an effect that was due, at least in part, to <z:mp ids='MP_0003223'>decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participation of Mas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury was confirmed in Mas knockout mice, which had reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size relative to mice with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Mas expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that activation of Mas during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury and further suggest that inhibition of Mas-G(q) signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy directed at cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
