<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is needed to facilitate new therapeutic approaches for the hypertensive, failing right ventricle (RV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to identify the mechanisms generating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a model of RV failure induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6980">monocrotaline</z:chebi> to induce either RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> or failure or with saline (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECGs were measured in conscious, unrestrained animals by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In isolated hearts, electrical activity was measured by optical mapping and myofiber orientation by diffusion tensor-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) handling was studied in single myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control animals, the T-wave of the ECG was prolonged and in three of seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> animals, prominent T-wave alternans occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discordant action potential (AP) alternans occurred in isolated failing hearts and Ca(2+) transient alternans in failing myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In failing hearts, AP duration and dispersion were increased; conduction velocity and AP restitution were steeper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter was intrinsic to failing single myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Failing hearts had greater fiber angle disarray; this correlated with AP duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Failing myocytes had reduced sarco(endo)plasmic reticular Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, increased sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+)-release fraction, and increased Ca(2+) spark leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In hypertrophied hearts and myocytes, dysfunctional adaptation had begun, but alternans did not develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased electrical and structural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> and dysfunctional sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) handling increased the probability of alternans, a proarrhythmic predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These mechanisms are potential therapeutic targets for the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in hypertensive, failing RVs </plain></SENT>
