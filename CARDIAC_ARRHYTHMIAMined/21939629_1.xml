<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of the number of extrastimuli during PES in patients with BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive 108 patients with type 1 electrocardiogram (104 men, mean age 46 ± 12 years; 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>], 40 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and 42 asymptomatic) underwent PES with a maximum of 3 extrastimuli from the right ventricular apex and the right ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA) was defined as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> or nonsustained polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> &gt;15 beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with VA induced by a single extrastimulus or double extrastimuli were assigned to group SD (Single/Double), by triple extrastimuli to group T (Triple), and the remaining patients to group N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VA was induced in 81 patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in 71 and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 10), in 4 by a single extrastimulus, in 41 by double extrastimuli, and in 36 by triple extrastimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 79 ± 48 months of follow-up, 24 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the overall inducibility of VA was not associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (log-rank P = .78), group SD had worse prognosis than did group T (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis in patients without prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> also showed that group SD had poorer outcome than did group T and group N (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values of VA induction with up to 2 extrastimuli were, respectively, 36% and 87%, better than those with up to 3 (23% and 81%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of extrastimuli that induced VA served as a prognostic indicator for patients with Brugada type 1 electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Single extrastimulus or double extrastimuli were adequate for PES of patients with BrS </plain></SENT>
