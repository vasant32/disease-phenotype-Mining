<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four groups of rats given subcutaneous injections of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg of DON or <z:chebi fb="14" ids="16052">propylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="10" ids="13643">glycol</z:chebi> (vehicle solution) were used in the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telemetric electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were performed for 2 weeks or longer during the pre- and post-DON injection period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that DON caused marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011706'>second-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, supraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp>, and ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>extrasystole</z:mp>, at 3 hr or later (mostly at 10-20 hr) after the DON-injection, which were accompanied by a significant increase in heart rate (HR) and a significant decrease in total power and low- and high-frequency power during the period from 90 to 180 min after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it was elucidated that DON produces significant cardiac dysfunction and transient inhibition of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function in conscious rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg s.c. or more </plain></SENT>
