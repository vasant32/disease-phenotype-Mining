<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) cardioversion is the cornerstone of the rhythm management strategy despite the lack of contemporary data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to describe present-day cardioversion of AF and identify characteristics associated with immediate and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on the 5333 AF patients enrolled in the multi-centre prospective Euro Heart Survey on AF we selected the 1801 patients undergoing cardioversion at enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm (SR) was restored in 630 of 712 (88%), 458 of 643 (71%), and 333 of 446 (75%) (P&lt; 0.001) of the electrical (ECV), intravenous (ivCCV), and oral (oCCV) chemical cardioversions, respectively, at the cost of few (4.2%) major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) (P&lt; 0.001), presence of paroxysmal AF (PAF) (P= 0.013), and use of biphasic waveform (P= 0.018) were predictors of successful ECV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For ivCCV PAF (P&lt; 0.001), absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (P= 0.004), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (P= 0.009), the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P= 0.018) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (P= 0.007) were predictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success of oCCV was driven by PAF (P&lt; 0.001) and a smaller left atrial dimension (P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 1-year follow-up 893 of 1271 (70%) patients were in SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed PAF (P&lt; 0.001), shorter total AF history (P&lt; 0.001), continuous use of Class Ic drugs or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> during follow-up (P&lt; 0.001), absence of COPD (P= 0.003), younger age (P= 0.004), and smaller left atrial dimension (P= 0.005) as independent predictors of SR at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary cardioversion of AF is routinely successfully and safely performed with a high proportion of patients in SR at 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
