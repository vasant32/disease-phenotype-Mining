<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different electroanatomical mapping software has been recently developed which uses a mathematical algorithm to improve interpolation between mapped points and delineation of closely spaced structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study tested the feasibility and accuracy of this software in comparison to traditional software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vivo 3D impedance-based mapping using a multielectrode catheter with a single geometry point cloud was performed in the left atria and pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) in 23 patients undergoing catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maps were analyzed with traditional (NavX, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, Minnetonka, MN, USA), either with or without multichamber mapping versus St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jude OneModelâ„¢ software and dimensions of cardiac chambers in human studies were compared to preprocedural computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) scans to determine the relative accuracy of the maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maps created by the OneModel software provided greater detail of complex cardiac structures compared to traditional software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the left atrial/pulmonary vein electroanatomical maps with the CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans as reference standard demonstrated significantly less error in measurement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostial long- and short-axis dimensions, inter-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> distance, and ridge width (left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> to left atrial appendage) with the OneModel versus traditional software (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions measured) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The OneModel software produces maps that are more accurate in rendering complex cardiac structures compared to traditional software </plain></SENT>
