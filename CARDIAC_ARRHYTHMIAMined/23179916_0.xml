<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Conventional electroanatomical mapping systems employ roving catheters with one or a small number of electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maps acquired using these systems usually contain a small number of points and take a long time to acquire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Use of a multielectrode catheter could facilitate rapid acquisition of higher-resolution maps through simultaneous collection of data from multiple points in space; however, a large multielectrode array could potentially limit catheter maneuverability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of using a novel, multielectrode catheter to map the right atrium and the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electroanatomical mapping of the right atrium and the left ventricle during both sinus and paced rhythm were performed in five swine using a conventional mapping catheter and a novel, multielectrode catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average map acquisition times for the multielectrode catheter (with continuous data collection) ranged from 5.2 to 9.5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These maps contained an average of 2,753 to 3,566 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Manual data collection with the multielectrode catheter was less rapid (average map completion in 11.4 to 18.1 min with an average of 870 to 1,038 points per map), but the conventional catheter was slower still (average map completion in 28.6 to 32.2 min with an average 120 to 148 points per map) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of this multielectrode catheter is feasible for mapping the left ventricle as well as the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multielectrode catheter facilitates acquisition of electroanatomical data more rapidly than a conventional mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This results in shorter map acquisition times and higher-density electroanatomical maps in these chambers </plain></SENT>
