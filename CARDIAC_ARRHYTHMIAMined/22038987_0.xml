<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides morphological, functional, and tissue characterization in a single setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the diagnostic yield of CMR-based imaging versus non-CMR-based imaging in patients with resuscitated SCD or SMVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-two patients with resuscitated SCD or SMVT underwent routine non-CMR imaging, followed by a CMR protocol with comprehensive tissue characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical reports of non-CMR imaging studies were blindly adjudicated and used to assign each patient to 1 of 7 diagnostic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMR imaging was blindly interpreted using a standardized algorithm used to assign a patient diagnosis category in a similar fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic yield of CMR-based and non-CMR-based imaging, as well as the impact of the former on diagnosis reclassification, was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> was identified in 51% of patients using non-CMR-based imaging and in 74% using CMR-based imaging (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients (50%) were reassigned to a new or alternate diagnosis using CMR-based imaging, including 15 (18%) with unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (24%) had no abnormality by non-CMR imaging but showed clinically relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> by CMR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CMR-based imaging provides a robust diagnostic yield in patients presenting with resuscitated SCD or SMVT and incrementally identifies clinically unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myocardial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When compared with non-CMR-based imaging, a new or alternate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> process may be identified in half of these patients </plain></SENT>
