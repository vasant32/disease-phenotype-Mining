<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) delivered to the myocardium increases capillary density and regional myocardial blood flow in animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, nonenzymatic nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production and the upregulation of vascular growth factor's <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by CSWT have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was therefore to test its potential to relieve symptoms in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Twenty-one patients (mean age 68.2 ± 8.3 years, 19 males) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> and evidence of inducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> during MIBI-SPECT imaging, were randomized into a treatment (n = 11) and a placebo arm (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The region of exercise-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was treated with echocardiographic guidance during nine sessions over a period of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One session of CSWT consisted of 200 shots/spot (9--12 spots/session) with an energy intensity of 0.09 mJ/mm(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group acoustic simulation was performed without energy application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medication was kept unchanged during the whole treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: In the treatment group, symptoms improved in 9/11 patients, and the ischemic threshold, determined by cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing, increased from 80 ± 28 to 95 ± 28 W (P= 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the placebo arm, only 2/10 patients reported an improvement and the ischemic threshold remained unchanged (98 ± 23 to 107 ± 23 W; P= 0.141) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The items "physical functioning" (P= 0.043), "general health perception" (P= 0.046), and "vitality" (P= 0.035) of the SF-36 questionnaire significantly improved in the treatment arm, whereas in the placebo arm, no significant change was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, troponin rise nor complications were observed during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: This placebo controlled trial shows a significant improvement in symptoms, quality of life parameters and ischemic threshold during exercise in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> treated with CSWT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, CSWT represents a new option for the treatment of patients with refractory AP </plain></SENT>
