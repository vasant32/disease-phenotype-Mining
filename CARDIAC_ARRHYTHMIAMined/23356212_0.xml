<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are persistent concerns regarding the safety of irrigated catheters in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we present our experience, in terms of effectiveness and safety, of irrigated catheter technology in children and adolescents who underwent ablation of WPW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed up <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients less than 18 years old (n = 41, mean age of 12.8 years old) who were referred to our center for radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of WPW between January 2010 and July 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients using an open irrigated-tip catheter (Celsius Thermocool 3.5 mm, 7F, B-type, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Power was started from 15 W up to 30 W in right-sided AP; RF pulses in left-sided APs were delivered at 40 W while 20 W was delivered inside the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean procedure time was 26.4 minutes and mean fluoroscopy time was 12.2 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall procedural success was obtained in 39/41 (95.1%) patients after the first procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients attended their scheduled follow-up visit at 3, 6, and 12 months and no recurrences were observed based on 12-lead electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RF ablation of APs using open irrigated-tip catheters can be performed in children and adolescents with a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term success rate, very short procedure times, and acceptable fluoroscopy times </plain></SENT>
