<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment with cariporide may modify the protein phenotype of the cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the equilibrium between a cariporide-modified phenotype and the supply of cariporide could be deleterious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the effects of this equilibrium rupture (EqR) on cardiac function at baseline and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were chronically treated with cariporide (2.5 mg·kg·d) or with placebo for 21 days, after which isolated Langendorff-mode heart perfusion experiments utilized cariporide-free buffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this type of perfusion, the drug is rapidly cleared from the cellular environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 30 minutes of stabilization, the hearts were subjected to global zero-flow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (25 minutes) followed by reperfusion (45 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measures of mechanical function, oxygen consumption, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> and proton release into the coronary effluent were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene and protein expression of proton extruders was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> cariporide administration followed by EqR reduced the expression of the Na/H exchanger, increased the expression of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17544">HCO3</z:chebi> or Na exchanger, decreased monocarboxylate/H carrier expression, reduced the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> release but did not change the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation rate and mechanical function compared with baseline conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The resulting low glycolytic rate was associated with a stronger <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, the early release of acidic forms was higher and redirected toward the use of the Na/H and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17544">HCO3 </z:chebi>/Na exchangers to the detriment of the safe monocarboxylate/H carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both phenomena were assumed to increase the Na uptake and activate the Na/Ca exchanger, resulting in Na and Ca overload and further cellular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This explains the impaired recovery of the contractile function observed in the EqR group during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although cariporide is usually cardioprotective, a disruption of its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> treatment followed by an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion event can become deleterious </plain></SENT>
