<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of COPD and related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> comorbidity among patients aged over 40 years visiting family practices in an area of Madrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in a health area of the Madrid Autonomous Region (Comunidad Autó<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028271" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="NOMA">noma</z:e> de Madrid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The practice population totalled 198,670 persons attended by 129 Family Physicians (FPs), and the study population was made up of persons over the age of 40 years drawn from this practice population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were deemed to have COPD if this diagnosis appeared on their clinical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of COPD; prevalence of a further 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases in patients with COPD; and standardised prevalence ratios, were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prevalence of COPD in family medicine was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0-3.3) overall, 5.3% among men and 1.4% among women; 90% of patients presented with comorbidity, with a mean of 4 ± 2.04 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases per patient, with the most prevalent related diseases being arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (52%), disorders of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism (34%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (25%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age and sex, the observed prevalence of the following ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases was higher than expected: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>; generalised artherosclerosis; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD, who are frequent in family practice, have a complex profile and pose a clinical and organisational challenge to FPs </plain></SENT>
