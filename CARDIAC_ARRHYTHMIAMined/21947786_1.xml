<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous approaches to left atrial appendage (LAA) closure are being developed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prophylaxis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients as an alternative to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-randomized clinical trials suggested that the first of these devices, the percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion (PLAATO) device, is safe and reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous closure has the potential limitation of incomplete exclusion of LAA from the systemic circulation, which could potentially lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the interaction between residual blood flow in the LAA after percutaneous closure with PLAATO and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the PLAATO trial current as of July 2010 was used for this analysis (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical occlusion using the PLAATO device was used in 22 patients (age 68���± 5, CHADS(2) score = 3.03 ± 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> were stopped during follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient due to development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After an average follow-up of 58 ± 9 months, four out of 22 patients (16.7%) developed a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, translating to an annualized embolic rate of 3.63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the demographics (age, sex, and CHADS(2) score) among patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac CT documented peri-device leak in three out of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in seven out of nine (75% vs. 77%, p = 0.706) patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that agreed to have a follow-up cardiac CT (Chi squared with Yates correction for this interaction = 0.012, p = 0.912) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TEE corroborated these results but failed to identify peri-device leak in three patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of our analysis suggests that in long-term follow-up, residual flow after LAA occlusion with the PLAATO device, as documented by cardiac CT, is ubiquitous but is not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
