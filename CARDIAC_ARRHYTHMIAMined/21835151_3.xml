<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PR prolongation predicts outcomes in potential CRT candidates and whether CRT benefits these candidates regardless of baseline PR interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A database of 1520 patients fulfilling criteria for CRT implant (the COMPANION Trial) was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients assigned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (PR &lt; 200 ms) or prolonged (PR â‰¥ 200 ms) cohorts were compared within the optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) and CRT groups regarding an endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRT was compared with OPT in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003896'>prolonged PR interval</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An interaction test was performed to determine whether CRT influenced outcome as a function of PR interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PR prolongation was present in 52% of COMPANION subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Randomization to CRT was associated with a reduction in the endpoint, but the strength of the association was greater for those with prolonged PR (hazard ratio = 0.54; P &lt;.01) versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PR (hazard ratio = 0.71; P = .02) intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRT (vs OPT) was associated with reduction in the endpoint for subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003896'>prolonged PR intervals</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction in relative risk (CRT vs OPT) was 29% (P = .02) for those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PR intervals but was 46% (P &lt;.01) for those with PR prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No interaction was detected between PR interval cohort and treatment (P = .17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PR prolongation may affect mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalizations in patients with systolic dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and wide QRS complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of PR prolongation may be attenuated by CRT </plain></SENT>
