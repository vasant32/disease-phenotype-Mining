<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The evaluation of therapeutic regimens in the prevention of recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) episodes in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal/persistent forms of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective observation included patients (n = 164), without and with AH, grade I and II, with paroxysmal (51.3%) or persistent (48.7%) recurrent form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of AF was 4.0 years, (Q1:2; Q3:7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anti-arrhythmic drugs were ineffective in prevention of AF episodes or non tolerated and were not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients precise control of blood pressure (BP) was implemented: patients were treated with beta-blockers: 100%; ACE-I: 65%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi>: 47%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>: 34%, loop-<z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>: 7%, calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>: 26.5% and alpha-blockers: 14.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of symptomatic and confirmed AF episodes was performed every 3 months during 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AH, grade I and II, was diagnosed in 115, 75%, of patients; (74% men, mean age 65.5 ± 9.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was more frequent in patients with AH: 83% in comparison with patients without AH: 67% (p 〈 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BP values were similar in normotensive and hypertensive patients after completing the study: 123 ± 9/79 ± 4 vs. 124 ± 10/80 ± 0.5 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hypotensive drug was used in 6 patients, 2 drugs in 38 patients, 3 in 37, 4 in 27, 5 in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3 drugs had more AF episodes in 3 months prior to evaluation: 4.7 ± 0.8 vs. 2.9 ± 0.4, p = 0.0444 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>But during 1-year follow-up, observed in 3-months periods, they had significant reduction in every 3-months period, p = 0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with 1.2 drugs had significant reduction after 3 months: p = 0.0029, 6 months: p = 0.04 and 12 months: p = 0.0012, but not after 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AH promotes more advanced AF forms occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Combined hypotensive therapy with minimum 3 drugs, including RAA inhibitors, may be effective in terms of BP control and reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
