<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using spatially coupled iterative maps of the beat-to-beat dynamics, we explore this pattern's dynamics in the regime of a calcium-dominated period-doubling instability at the single-cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We find a novel nonlinear bifurcation associated with the formation of a discontinuous jump in the amplitude of calcium alternans at nodes separating discordant regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that this jump unidirectionally pins nodes by preventing their motion away from the pacing site following a pacing rate decrease but permitting motion towards this site following a rate increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unidirectional pinning leads to strongly history-dependent node motion that is strongly arrhythmogenic </plain></SENT>
