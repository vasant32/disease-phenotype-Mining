<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although right ventricular septal (RVS) sites are commonly used, the results have been controversial because of poor standardization of lead position by fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the utility of a new RVS pacing technique based on the combination of fluoroscopy (F), and electrophysiological mapping (F + EP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) electromechanical activation was determined in patients undergoing RVS pacing and the results of the F + EP approach were compared with those derived from standard F alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between December 2008 and November 2010 we enrolled 156 consecutive patients undergoing permanent RVS pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standard F approach was used in 93 patients and the F + EP technique was applied to 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electromechanical activation was assessed by: (i) electromechanical latency (EML) interval measured from the QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the mechanical activation of the basal LV and (ii) intra-LV dyssynchrony measured as the interval from the earliest to the latest LV basal motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra-LV dyssynchrony was found in 46.2% patients in the F group compared with 15.9% in the group F + EP (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The F group demonstrated a significantly higher degree of intra-LV dyssynchrony than F + EP group (43.9 ± 24.3 vs. 26.5 ± 15.4 ms; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The F group exhibited a significantly higher EML duration compared with the F + EP group (215.8 ± 25.3 vs. 195.1 ± 17.4 ms; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During RVS pacing, the F + EP approach provides a more physiological LV activation than the standard F technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of these short-term findings needs to be correlated with long-term data </plain></SENT>
