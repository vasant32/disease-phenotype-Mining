<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have established cardio-protective effects of furnidipine and its active metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore decided to compare the influence of oral and intravenous administration of furnidipine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, nitrendipine and nimodipine to examine their effects on hemodynamics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> are oxidatively metabolized in the body and the oxidized metabolites are among the final products, we studied the influence of four oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> (oxy <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, oxy nimodipine, oxy nitrendipine and oxy nisoldipine) on the same parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>- and reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of rats was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">Dihydropyridines</z:chebi> were administered 5 mg/kg orally (24 and 1 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) or 5 Î¼g/kg intravenously (10 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>20 mg/kg of the oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> was given orally (24 and 1 h before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> exhibited significant anti-arrhythmic actions after both forms of administration but their influence on blood pressure was differential and contrasting and depended on route of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> imparted strong protection against lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> while exerting differential influences on blood pressure with oxy <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> and oxy nisoldipine being hypertensive and oxy nitrendipine being most normotensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential effects observed with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> after the two routes of administration lend strength to the hypothesis that their metabolites may have a significant role in mediating the actions of the parent drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strong anti-arrhythmic action of the oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridines</z:chebi> along with their differential effect on blood pressure could indicate their potential use as cardio-protective drugs in certain groups of patients </plain></SENT>
