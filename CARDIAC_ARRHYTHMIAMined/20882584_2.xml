<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) activity has been linked repeatedly to children's socioemotional and behavioral adaptive functioning and development, yet the literature on how various indexes of ANS activity develop in childhood is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We utilized latent growth modeling to investigate the development of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), an established index of parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (PNS), and preejection period (PEP), a marker of sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (SNS) influence on the heart, in children aged 8-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At age 8, 251 children (128 girls, 123 boys; 162 European American, 89 African American) participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data were collected during two additional waves when children were 9 and 10 years of age, with a 1-year lag between each wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children's RSA and PEP exhibited significant stability over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marginally significant variability was found among children in how RSA changed over time (slope), but there was no significant interindividual variability in PEP changes over development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A conditional growth curve model (i.e., one with predictor variables) showed that initial levels of RSA and PEP and the slope of RSA over time were predicted by several demographic factors including the child's sex and race; RSA of European American children showed significant increases over time while African American children had higher initial RSA but no significant change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings extend basic knowledge in developmental biopsychology and have implications for research focusing on ANS measures as important predictors, moderators, and mediators of childhood adaptation </plain></SENT>
