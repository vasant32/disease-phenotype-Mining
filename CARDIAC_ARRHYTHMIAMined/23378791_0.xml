<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is a substantial cause of mortality and morbidity in the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a massive burden on health care systems, and its prevalence is expected to double over the next 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trials evaluating antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation have focused on recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, perhaps neglecting outcomes relevant to patients, such as symptoms, need for antiarrhythmic drugs, need for hospitalization, and rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An association has been demonstrated between sinus rhythm and survival in several studies, and there is evidence emerging that successful catheter ablation may reduce rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with paroxysmal AF or persistent AF of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, although it may cause adverse events in permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New antiarrhythmic drugs are a welcome addition to the armamentarium, since there are limitations to current antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone cannot be used safely in those with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> has important adverse reactions that limit long-term use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the use of conventional antiarrhythmic drugs may negate any survival benefit derived from maintaining sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> appears promising with respect to hard endpoints such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in certain patients, it may not be safe for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or those with permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the trials suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> may impact on these endpoints were compared with placebo rather than with an active comparator group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further "head-to-head" comparisons between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> and other antiarrhythmic drugs are needed to determine whether this property is unique to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
