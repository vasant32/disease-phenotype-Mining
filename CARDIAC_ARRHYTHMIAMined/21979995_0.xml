<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Implantable loop recorder (ILR) use has been proposed to study patients with unexplained recurrent syncopal events, but its usefulness remains to be defined in patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ILR as a diagnostic tool in BS patients suspected of low or moderate risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We gathered data from 11 ILR recipients with supposed risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, issue of Amiens registry of 204 patients with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reported clinical events before and after implant, electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics, ILR findings, and its limitations as well as tried to specify ILR utility in diagnosis approach and its consequent contribution to guide the optimal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the 11 patients (8 men, 3 women), 9 were symptomatic, and 5 had a spontaneous Type 1 ECG pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During mean follow-up period of 33 months, 8 patients had a recurrence of symptoms with a mean delay of 9 months after implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>Bradycardia</z:hpo> (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular blocks</z:hpo> and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>) was detected in four out of eight patients (50%), and there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in any patient during symptomatic events which included six vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two initially asymptomatic patients did not experience any symptoms after ILR implant and their ILR recordings did not reveal any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ILR contributed to the exclusion of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> as a mechanism of an atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients with electrocardiographic BS and the suspension of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Episodes of transient symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> were the most common findings suggesting the vagal mechanism of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of ILR should be considered in selected patients with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and spontaneous or transient Type 1 ECG pattern </plain></SENT>
