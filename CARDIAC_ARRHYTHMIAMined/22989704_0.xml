<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether atRA could prevent cardiotoxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the study, a rat myocardial cell line (H9c2) exposed to different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="34887">nickel chloride</z:chebi> (NiCl(2)) displayed apoptotic features accompanied by reactive oxygen species generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, NiCl(2) also caused obvious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and systolic dysfunction in primary myocardial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with atRA efficiently attenuated the cytotoxicities triggered by NiCl(2) as it significantly mitigated ROS generation and <z:mp ids='MP_0004876'>decreased MAP</z:mp> kinases activity in NiCl(2)-treated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, NiCl(2) exposure caused obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in Sprague-Dawley rats with the maximum tolerance dose of NiCl(2) between 2 and 3mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combinational intragastric administration of 40mg/kg atRA can partially reverse NiCl(2)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that atRA might have therapeutic potential in alleviating the adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> on the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
