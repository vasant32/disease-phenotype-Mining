<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients with previous ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) may experience recurrence of perimitral flutter (PMFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are usually triggered from sources that may also induce AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims at determining whether ablation of triggers or completing mitral valve isthmus (MVI) block prevents more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with recurrent PMFL after initial ablation of long standing persistent AF were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients were randomized to MVI ablation only (Group 1) and 33 were randomized to cardioversion and repeat pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation plus ablation of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MVI bidirectional block was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient from Group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, reconnection of 17 PVs was detected in 14 patients (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> challenge, 44 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> trigger sites were identified in 28 patients (85%, 1.57 sites per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 18-month follow-up, 27 patients (84%) from Group 1 had recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias, of whom 15 remained on antiarrhythmic drug (AAD); however, 28 patients from Group 2 (85%, P &lt; 0.0001 vs Group 1) were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> off AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ablation strategy used in Group 2 was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.10, 95% CI 0.04-0.28, P &lt; 0.001) and an improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival (log rank P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients presenting with PMFL after ablation for longstanding persistent AF, MVI block had limited impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers achieved higher freedom from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
