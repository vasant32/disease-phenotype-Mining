<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gradual loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular preexcitation</z:hpo> during exercise stress testing (EST) has an unclear risk of an association with life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and could be related to the accessory pathway (AP) location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> during EST with the risk assessment during invasive electrophysiology testing and determined whether the loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> correlates with the AP location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed patients aged ≤21 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular preexcitation</z:hpo> who had undergone both EST and an electrophysiology study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 3 groups: sudden loss (SL), gradual loss (GL), or no loss (NL) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> during EST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 76 patients were included, with 11 (14%) in the SL group, 18 (24%) in the GL group, and 47 (62%) in the NL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SL group demonstrated a longer cycle length with 1-to-1 conduction by way of the AP during incremental atrial pacing compared with the NL group (375 ± 135 ms vs 296 ± 52 ms, p = 0.002), with no difference between the GL and NL groups (325 ± 96 vs 296 ± 52 ms, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with 1-to-1 AP conduction of &lt;270 ms, none (0 of 11) were in the SL group compared to 18 of 47 in the NL group (p = 0.0017), with no significant difference in the GL group (5 of 18) compared to the NL group (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients in the GL group were more likely to have a left-sided AP (14 of 18) than the NL group (17 of 47, p = 0.002) and the SL group (3 of 11, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a sudden loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> during an EST predicted a long cycle length with 1-to-1 conduction by way of the AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the AP conduction characteristics in patients with GL compared to those with NL did not differ, and the GL of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> was more frequently seen in patients with a left-sided AP </plain></SENT>
