<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As part of a 3-wk intersession workshop funded by a National Science Foundation Expeditions in Computing award, 15 undergraduate students from the City University of New York(1) collaborated on a study aimed at characterizing the voltage dynamics and arrhythmogenic behavior of cardiac cells for a broad range of physiologically relevant conditions using an in silico model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary goal of the workshop was to cultivate student interest in computational modeling and analysis of complex systems by introducing them through lectures and laboratory activities to current research in cardiac modeling and by engaging them in a hands-on research experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The success of the workshop lay in the exposure of the students to active researchers and experts in their fields, the use of hands-on activities to communicate important concepts, active engagement of the students in research, and explanations of the significance of results as the students generated them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The workshop content addressed how spiral waves of electrical activity are initiated in the heart and how different parameter values affect the dynamics of these reentrant waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spiral waves are clinically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, when the waves remain stable, and with <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, when the waves exhibit breakup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in silico experiments were conducted by simulating a mathematical model of cardiac cells on graphics processing units instead of the standard central processing units of desktop computers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach decreased the run time for each simulation to almost real time, thereby allowing the students to quickly analyze and characterize the simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results from these simulations, as well as some of the background and methodology taught during the workshop, is presented in this article along with the programming code and the explanations of simulation results in an effort to allow other teachers and students to perform their own demonstrations, simulations, and studies </plain></SENT>
