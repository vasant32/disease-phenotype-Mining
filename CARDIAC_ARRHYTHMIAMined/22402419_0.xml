<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> (SDB) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> has attracted attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the influence of SDB on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 89 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative portable monitoring for SDB and Holter electrocardiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end-points were the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary end-points were: (1) patient background factors; (2) average heart rate; (3) maximum heart rate (total, daytime, and nighttime); (4) minimum heart rate (total, daytime, and nighttime); (5) minimum SaO(2) during sleep; and (6) an independent predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (29.2%) had an AHIâ‰¥15 and they were classified into the SDB group, while patients with an AHI&lt;15 formed the non-SDB group (70.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, frequent nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> were significantly more common in the SDB group (19.2%) than the non-SDB group (3.2%) (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum daytime and nighttime heart rates were also significantly higher in the SDB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AHI was a significant predictor for frequent nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SDB is common among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and that SDB might be closely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
