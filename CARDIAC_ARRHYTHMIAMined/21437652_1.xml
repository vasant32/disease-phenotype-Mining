<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) using non-contact electro-anatomic mapping in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVD/C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (44 ± 15 years) with ARVD/C and symptomatic VTs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had syncopal VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had recurrent VT while on AICD; in three patients, RFA was done prior to AICD implantation, and ten patients refused AICD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After obtaining activation maps, first, the clinical VT was targeted, and then, other VTs were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five inducible VTs were mapped, and 22 of them were successfully ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 13 out of 15 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the clinical and inducible VTs were ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients, non-clinical inducible VTs could not be ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 25 ± 16 months (2-52 months), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had recurrence of non-clinical VT on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no episodes of asymptomatic VT recorded in five patients with AICD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A majority of induced VT in patients with ARVD/C can be successfully mapped and ablated using the non-contact Ensite Array Mapping system with good long-term VT-free outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ablation can be a useful adjunct to AICD implantation in such patients </plain></SENT>
