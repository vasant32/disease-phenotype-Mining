<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> β-blockade on transient outward, sustained and inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents (I(TO), I(KSUS) and I(K1)) in human atrial myocytes and on the expression of underlying ion channel subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ion currents were recorded from human right atrial isolated myocytes using the whole-cell-patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were measured using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> β-blockade was associated with a 41% reduction in I(TO) density: 9.3 ± 0.8 (30 myocytes, 15 patients) vs 15.7 ± 1.1 pA/pF (32, 14), p &lt; 0.05; without affecting its voltage-, time- or rate dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I(K1) was reduced by 34% at -120 mV (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither I(KSUS), nor its increase by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> β-stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>, was affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> β-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modelling suggested that the combination of I(TO)- and I(K1)-decrease could result in a 28% increase in APD(90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> β-blockade did not alter <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein expression of the I(TO) pore-forming subunit, Kv4.3, or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of the accessory subunits KChIP2, KChAP, Kvβ1, Kvβ2 or frequenin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Kir2.1 or TWIK to account for the reduction in I(K1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A reduction in atrial I(TO) and I(K1) associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> β-blocker treatment in patients may contribute to the associated action potential prolongation, and this cannot be explained by a reduction in expression of associated ion channel subunits </plain></SENT>
