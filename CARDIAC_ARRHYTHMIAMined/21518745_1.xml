<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in appropriately selected patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) is associated with cost-effectiveness ratios similar to, or better than, other accepted treatments, including renal dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The up-front costs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy are admittedly high and as such, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation is more akin to an operation than a drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As would be the case for a life-saving operation, the adoption of short time horizons is apt to lead to underestimations of cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As well as the time horizon, the underlying aetiology of the arrhythmic substrate, implantation technique, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> battery life, and the presence of co-morbidities are important issues in maximizing cost effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, we should consider that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is the only available option for prolonging survival in patients who are at risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
