<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate, in a set of 93 mutation-negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) probands, the frequency of copy number variants (CNVs) in LQTS genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: LQTS is an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> characterized by a prolonged heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggested the involvement of duplications or deletions in the occurrence of LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, their frequency remains unknown in LQTS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Point mutations in KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A genes were excluded by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to detect CNVs in exons of these 3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal exon copy numbers were confirmed by quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragment (QMPSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis was performed using Agilent Human Genome 244K Microarrays to further map the genomic rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 3 different deletions in 3 unrelated families: 1 in KCNQ1 and 2 involving KCNH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We showed in the largest family that the deletion involving KCNH2 is fully penetrant and segregates with the long QT phenotype in 7 affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that CNVs in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 explain around 3% of LQTS in patients with no point mutation in these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This percentage is likely higher than the frequency of point mutations in ANKB, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, CACNA1C, CAV3, SCN4B, AKAP9, and SNTA1 together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, we propose that CNV screening in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 may be performed routinely in LQTS patients </plain></SENT>
