<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Retrospective data imply a better outcome with stimulation of the latest contracting left ventricular (LV) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study analysed the feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of prospectively planned LV lead placement at the site of latest mechanical activation.METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with CRT indication were assessed by three-dimensional (3D) transoesophageal echocardiography and rotation angiography of the coronary sinus (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both images were merged into a single 3D-model to identify CS target veins close to the site of latest mechanical activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, LV lead deployment was attempted at the desired target position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were clinically and echocardiographically evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of latest mechanical activation covered 6 ± 2 segments (38 ± 13% of LV surface) and was found lateral in 24 of 37 (65%), anterior in 11 of 37 (30%), inferior in 2 of 37 (5%), and septal in 1 of 37 (3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 36 of 37 (97%) patients an appropriate target vein was identified and successful implantation could be performed in 34 of 37 (92%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among those patients clinical and echocardiographic response was observed in 91% and 81%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Individualized lead placement at the latest contracting LV site can be performed safely and successfully in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical outcome data are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of target sites requires multimodality integration between LV wall motion data and CS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future developments need to improve those technologies and require randomized data on clinical outcome parameters </plain></SENT>
