<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two studies were conducted to test defibrillation and detection feasibility of an SICD system located in the left chest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first study, 2 pockets were created in 15 canines for placement of an anterior electrode adjacent to the left edge of the sternum and a lateral electrode at the site along the axillary line between the 4th and 6th intercostal space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stainless steel flat electrodes with active surface areas of 5, 10, 20, and 25 cm(2) or rod electrodes were subsequently positioned and the defibrillation threshold (DFT) was measured for multiple combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second study, the ability to induce, detect, and provide shock delivery in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) using an SICD system engineered for clinical use was tested in 5 canines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three DFT tests with 11 different dual electrode combinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> combinations terminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> with a DFT of 35 ± 16 J (range: 9-79 J) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes were induced and recognized by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> SICD, leading to automatic capacitor charge and shock delivery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous defibrillation using different electrode combinations with shock energies less than 80 J terminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VFs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An automatic SICD proved effective in detecting and activating shock delivery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases.  </plain></SENT>
