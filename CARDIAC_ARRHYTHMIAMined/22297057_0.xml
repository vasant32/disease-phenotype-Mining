<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency, outcome, and clinical predictors of cardiac complications as the initial manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 76 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> or functional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paraganglioma</z:hpo> treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, from 1995 to 2011 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients initially presenting with cardiac complications were identified, and their clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics were compared with those of the patients presenting with other complaints, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342500" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adrenal mass</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 76 patients, 9 (12%) presented with the following: 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0587044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular thrombus</z:e>, 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and 3 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Failure to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> resulted in unnecessary invasive interventions in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery of cardiac function was excellent after resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the 67 patients presenting with other complaints, the 9 with cardiac complications had similar demographics and cardiac risk factors but harbored larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (6.7 ± 0.8 cm versus 4.4 ± 0.3 cm; P = .015) and exhibited higher biochemical marker levels (23.9 ± 9.0-fold versus 11.3 ± 2.4-fold; P = .082), longer corrected QT interval (473 ± 8 ms versus 443 ± 6 ms; P = .015), and lower ejection fraction (43% ± 8% versus 66% ± 2%; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, 12% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> initially presented with cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and high levels of biochemical markers were more likely to develop cardiac injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> should be ruled out in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> and features suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> so that unnecessary interventions can be avoided and cardiac recovery can be achieved </plain></SENT>
