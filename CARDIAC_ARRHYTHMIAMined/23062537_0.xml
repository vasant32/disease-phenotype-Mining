<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A new entirely S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> has been introduced, that does not require lead placement in or on the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report the largest multicenter experience to date with the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> with a minimum of 1-year follow-up in the first 118 Dutch patients who were implanted with this device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were selected if they had a class I or IIa indication for primary or secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients from 4 high-volume centers in the Netherlands with an S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted between December 2008 and April 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (75% males, mean age 50 years) received the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 18 months of follow-up, 8 patients experienced 45 successful appropriate shocks (98% first shock conversion efficacy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (13%) received inappropriate shocks, mainly due to T-wave oversensing, which was mostly solved by a software upgrade and changing the sensing vector of the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (14%) experienced complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were more frequent in the first 15 implantations per center compared with subsequent implantations (inappropriate shocks 19% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.03; complications 17% vs. 10%, p = 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> is effective in terminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is, however, a considerable percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> related adverse events, which decreases as the therapy evolves and experience increases </plain></SENT>
