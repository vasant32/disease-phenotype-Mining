<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (AC) is closely associated with desmosomal mutations in a majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmogenesis in patients with AC is likely related to remodeling of cardiac gap junctions and increased levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, using experimental models, we also identified <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel dysfunction secondary to desmosomal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the immunoreactive signal levels of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel protein NaV1.5, as well as connexin43 (Cx43) and plakoglobin (PKG), in myocardial specimens obtained from patients with AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Left and right ventricular free wall postmortem material was obtained from 5 patients with AC and 5 controls matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular septal biopsies were taken from another 15 patients with AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the 2010 revised Task Force Criteria for the diagnosis of AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses were performed using antibodies against Cx43, PKG, NaV1.5, plakophilin-2, and N-cadherin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: N-cadherin and desmoplakin immunoreactive signals and distribution were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with AC compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plakophilin-2 signals were unaffected unless a plakophilin-2 mutation predicting haploinsufficiency was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distribution was unchanged compared to that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive signal levels of PKG, Cx43, and NaV1.5 were disturbed in 74%, 70%, and 65% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A reduced immunoreactive signal of PKG, Cx43, and NaV1.5 at the intercalated disks can be observed in a large majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of Nav1.5 might contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vulnerability and, in the future, potentially could serve as a new clinically relevant tool for risk assessment strategies </plain></SENT>
