<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk-stratification schemes for SCN5A mutation carriers remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of SCN5A promoter variants and DNA methylation by using a family-based approach in predicting phenotype severity in a kindred with loss-of-function SCN5A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a large kindred with a heterozygous SCN5A loss-of-function mutation (1936delC, Q646RfsX5; 22 mutation carriers), we sought SCN5A promoter variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we assessed SCN5A and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles on genomic DNA derived from blood (Illumina Human Methylation27 BeadChip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During systematic survey of the 2.8-kb SCN5A promoter region, we identified 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms in complete linkage disequilibrium (rs41310749 and rs41310239) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These promoter variants were significantly associated with disease severity (mild vs severe phenotype) (P = .0007), as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients with severe phenotype carried the 2-SNP variant on both mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis did not support a role for the methylation of SCN5A-related genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These family-based genetic findings suggest that the presence of specific promoter variants increase the risk of a severe phenotype in heterozygous carriers of an SCN5A loss-of-function mutation </plain></SENT>
