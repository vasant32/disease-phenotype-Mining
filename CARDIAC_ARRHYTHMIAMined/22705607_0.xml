<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mortality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA) has been shown to be higher than those without VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of data on VA among ACS patients in the Middle Eastern countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study of patients admitted in 17 government hospitals with ACS between December 2005 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were categorized as having VA if they experienced either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) or sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5055 patients with ACS enrolled in the SPACE registry, 168 (3.3%) were diagnosed with VA and 151 (98.8%) occurred in-hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vast majority (74.4%) occurred in patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, males were twice as likely to develop VA than females (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Killip class &gt;I (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.1); and systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg (OR 6.4; 95% CI 3.5-11.8) were positively associated with VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.3-0.7) had a lower risk of developing VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse in-hospital outcomes including re-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, cardiogenic shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were higher for patients with VA (Pâ‰¤.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables) and signified a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in VA patients compared with non-VA patients (27% vs 2.2%; P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital VA in Saudi patients with ACS was associated with remarkably high rates of adverse events and increased in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using a well-developed registry data with a large number of patients, our study documented for the first time the prevalence and risk factors of VA in unselected population of ACS </plain></SENT>
