<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Residual right ventricular (RV) outflow tract pathology is universal among patients with repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> (PR) is also commonly present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although tolerated in early life, by the second decade of life PR is associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is a safe procedure that will eliminate PR, but timing and indications are evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or prolonged QRS duration are candidates for PVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> are likely to have improvement in symptoms and quality of life and should be offered PVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance has become an essential component of the management of the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> with PR, and has identified the potential for and limitations of RV remodeling following PVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with severe RV enlargement, particularly those with diminished RV or left ventricular function, there is an increased risk of adverse events and even asymptomatic patients with severe PR should be considered for PVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Valve replacement is accomplished with homografts or heterografts, either stented bioprosthetic valves or valved conduits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin experience with PVR, there was no difference in survival or freedom from reintervention between heterografts and homografts </plain></SENT>
