<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) frequently present to clinicians in the prehospital and emergency medicine settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restoring sinus rhythm by terminating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> involves increasing the refractoriness of AV nodal tissue within the myocardium by means of vagal manoeuvres, pharmacological agents or electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A commonly used first-line technique to restore the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (reversion) is the Valsalva Manoeuvre (VM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a non-invasive means of increasing myocardial refractoriness by increasing intrathoracic pressure for a brief period, thus stimulating baroreceptor activity in the aortic arch and carotid bodies, resulting in increased parasympathetic (vagus nerve) tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence of effectiveness of the Valsalva Manoeuvre in terminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEARCH METHODS: We electronically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 1 of 12, 2012); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to January 2012); EMBASE Ovid (1947 to January 2012); Web of Science (1970 to 27 January 2012); and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to 27 January 2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Trials registries, the Index to Theses and the bibliographies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant publications identified by these strategies were also checked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SELECTION CRITERIA: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of the Valsalva Manoeuvre in terminating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted the data using a standardised form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Each trial was assessed for internal validity with differences resolved by discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data were then extracted and entered into Review Manager 5.1 (RevMan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: We identified three randomised controlled trials including 316 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three studies compared the effectiveness of VM in reverting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> with that of other vagal manoeuvres in a cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two studies induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> within a controlled laboratory environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Participants had ceased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medications prior to engaging in these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The third study reported on patients presenting to a hospital emergency department with an episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These patients were not controlled for medications or other factors prior to intervention.The two laboratory studies demonstrated reversion rates of 45.9% and 54.3%, whilst the clinical study demonstrated reversion success of 19.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy may be due to methodological differences between studies, the effect of induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> versus spontaneous episodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, and participant factors such as medications and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We were unable to assess any of these factors further, nor adverse effects, since they were either not described in enough detail or not reported at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>.Statistical pooling was not possible due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between the included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We did not find sufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of the Valsalva Manoeuvre for termination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed and this should include a standardised approach to performance technique and methodology </plain></SENT>
