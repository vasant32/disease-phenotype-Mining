<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The standard searching strategy of the Neonatal Review Group as outlined in the Cochrane Library was used to retrieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical literatures about TH on HIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RevMan 5.1 software was used to perform the meta-analysis of target papers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and severe major neurodevelopmental disabilities at 18 - 24 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> (CP), neurodevelopmental delay, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and main side effects of cooling therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 276 papers fulfilled the search strategy and 11 trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall TH resulted in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in the combined outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or major neurodevelopmental disabilities to 18-24 months of age (RR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68 - 0.84, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as compared with the control group, TH significantly decreased the incidence of mortality (RR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.65 - 0.90, P &lt; 0.01), psychomotor development index(RR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.55 - 0.87, P &lt; 0.01), mental development index (RR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.53 - 0.83, P &lt; 0.01), CP (RR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.54 - 0.91, P &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (RR = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.33 - 0.90, P &lt; 0.05)except for severe hearing loss (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>) (RR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.35 - 1.34, P = 0.3000) in survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects included significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in the TH group (P = 0.0400) but without deleterious consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> requiring inotropic supports, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> between the TH and control groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is effective in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and major disabilities in infants with moderate-to-severe HIE without significant side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Infants presenting within the first hours after birth with the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> should be cooled in accordance with the established protocols of previous randomized controlled trials </plain></SENT>
