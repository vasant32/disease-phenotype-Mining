<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of the CSSS in an elderly population with suspected VVS.METHODS AND RESULTS: Hundred and eighty patients of ≥60 years of age (mean 73.4 ± 7.8) with suspected clinical diagnosis of VVS were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CSSS (VVS score ≥-2) was calculated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients prior to undergoing head-up tilt test (HUT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized HUT protocol with active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> phase was used to reproduce syncopal symptoms as gold standard for diagnosis of VVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hundred and forty patients had positive HUT response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three patients (42.3%) had CSSS ≥-2 suggesting a diagnosis of VVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Calgary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> Symptom Score sensitivity was 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.59] and specificity 0.73 (95% CI 0.52-0.85) with positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.93) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.21-0.40), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred (55.6%) patients had previous history of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> documented during assessment prior to HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this population sensitivity and specificity was markedly reduced: 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.29) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.57-0.80), respectively.CONCLUSION: The CSSS has a lower sensitivity and specificity in an elderly population presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> compared to previously validated data in young adults, particularly in elderly patients with previous history of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A modified CSSS may be needed to improve specificity and sensitivity in this population </plain></SENT>
