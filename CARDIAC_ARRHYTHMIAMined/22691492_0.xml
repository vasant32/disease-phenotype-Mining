<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Integrated physiological systems, such as the cardiac and the respiratory system, exhibit complex dynamics that are further influenced by intrinsic feedback mechanisms controlling their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To probe how the cardiac and the respiratory system adjust their rhythms, despite continuous fluctuations in their dynamics, we study the phase synchronization of heartbeat intervals and respiratory cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nature of this interaction, its physiological and clinical relevance, and its relation to mechanisms of neural control is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigate whether and how cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CRPS) responds to changes in physiological states and conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that the degree of CRPS in healthy subjects dramatically changes with sleep-stage transitions and exhibits a pronounced stratification pattern with a 400% increase from rapid eye movement sleep and wake, to light and deep sleep, indicating that sympatho-vagal balance strongly influences CRPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For elderly subjects, we find that the overall degree of CRPS is reduced by approximately 40%, which has important clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the sleep-stage stratification pattern we uncover in CRPS does not break down with advanced age, and surprisingly, remains stable across subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the difference in CRPS between sleep stages exceeds the difference between young and elderly, suggesting that sleep regulation has a significantly stronger effect on cardiorespiratory coupling than healthy aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that CRPS and the traditionally studied respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> represent different aspects of the cardiorespiratory interaction, and that key physiologic variables, related to regulatory mechanisms of the cardiac and respiratory systems, which influence respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, do not affect CRPS </plain></SENT>
