<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> as class III antiarrhythmic drug may significantly alter the defibrillation threshold (DFT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conflicting results exist on the clinical relevance of a DFT rise on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only prospective study on this issue included only a small number of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and clinical relevance of repeat defibrillator testing after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in modern defibrillator systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed risks and clinical consequences of retesting defibrillation safety margin after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in 130 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent intraoperative testing at the time of first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> induction and defibrillator test (by protocol with a single shock and 10 J safety margin) after a total dose of at least 10 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> 4-6 weeks after initiation of medication was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DFT testing after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was safe as there were no complications that led to a prolonged hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 114 patients with a left-sided device (1.6%) and 3 of 7 patients with a right-sided device (42.8%), a 10 J safety margin could not be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result 4 patients (3.1% of study collective) had a revision of the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Repeat defibrillation testing after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy rarely fails in patients with left-sided devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We observed a higher test failure in patients with a device in the right-subpectoral position although this subgroup was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeat defibrillator testing is safe as no relevant complications were observed </plain></SENT>
