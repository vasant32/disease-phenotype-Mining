<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of device complications in patients with BrS during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of device-related complications and the clinical outcome were determined in 41 consecutive patients with BrS (age 48 ± 12 years; 38 men) who were treated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 76 months (interquartile range 51 to 98), 15 patients (37%) experienced 21 adverse events, including 11 device-related complications in 8 (20%) and ≥1 inappropriate shock in 10 (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (12%) received appropriate shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding inappropriate shocks, 95.1%, 89.6%, 86.6%, and 73.3% of patients were free of device-related complications at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, 92.6%, 89.8%, 89.9%, and 86.1% were free of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation are not uncommon, and their prevalence increases with the follow-up duration required for patients with BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, because complications can be encountered even very late after device implantation, asymptomatic young patients should be carefully selected and educated about the long-term outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
