<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of preventive interventions in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives were to measure the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and associated factors among older people living institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were obtained from a survey on a probabilistic sample of residents aged ≥65 years, drawn in 1998-99 from institutions of Madrid (Spain) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residents, their caregivers, and facility physicians were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fall rates were computed based on the number of physician-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in the preceding 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjusted rate ratios were computed using negative binomial regression models, including age, sex, cognitive status, functional dependence, number of diseases, and polypharmacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The final sample comprised 733 residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fall rate was 2.4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> per person-year (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04-2.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The strongest risk factor was number of diseases, with an adjusted rate ratio (RR) of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.17-1.50) for each additional diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other variables associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> (RR = 2.56 [95% CI, 1.32-4.94]); antidepressant use (RR = 2.32 [95% CI, 1.22-4.40]); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (RR = 2.00 [95% CI, 1.05-3.81]); and polypharmacy (RR = 1.07 [95% CI, 0.95-1.21], for each additional medication) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The attributable fraction for number of diseases (with reference to those with ≤ 1 condition) was 84% (95% CI, 45-95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Number of diseases was the main risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in this population of institutionalized older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other variables associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, probably more amenable to preventive action, were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, antidepressants, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and polypharmacy </plain></SENT>
