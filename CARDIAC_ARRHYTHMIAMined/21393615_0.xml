<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent a laboratory assessment of RSA during rest and also during a series of psychological stressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, they kept daily measures of affect and interaction quality for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual differences in baseline and stress levels of RSA moderated within-person associations between daily affect and the quality of couple interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pattern of results differed for women versus men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Men with lower vagal tone or higher vagal reactivity had stronger associations between daily negative affect and daily negative interactions, and men with higher vagal tone had more positive daily interactions overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with higher vagal tone had stronger associations between daily positive affect and daily positive interactions </plain></SENT>
