<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The left and right atria have different susceptibilities toward developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> more commonly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the molecular basis for such differences, we catalogued micro (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">mi</z:e>)<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression differences by next generation sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Four human left-right atrial pairs were subjected to whole-genome expression analyses via next-generation sequencing of small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, including miRNAs, and poly-A-enriched <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a paired sample design, significant differences in the expression of 32 miRNAs were found in between the left and right atria at a probability value of &lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hsa-miR-143 was the most highly expressed miRNA in the atria, as quantified by <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 746 and 2292 differentially expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> between the left and right atria at false discovery rates of &lt;0.001 and &lt;0.05, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcription factor binding elements within 2 kb of RefSeq genes were determined and specific motifs were identified that were enriched in differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, specific miRNA target sequences in 3' UTRs were also enriched in differentially expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 11 novel noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of unknown function were found to be differentially expressed between the left and right atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in miRNA and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles between the left and right atria, which may yield insight into increased the arrhythmogenesis of the left atria </plain></SENT>
