<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that aquaporin-4 (AQP4) knockout (KO) mice might exhibit abnormal Ca(2+) modulating proteins resulting from the exacerbation of pro-inflammatory factors in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of FKBP12.6, SERCA2a, and CASQ2 and calcium leak in diastole have been recognized as endpoints for assessing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AQP4 KO mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, such as control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISO, β-receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) injected (1 mg/kg, sc, 5 d), and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> (AMG, 100 mg/kg, po, a selective inhibitor of the iNOS) during the last 3d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR, western blot and calcium transient measurements were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the cardiac weight index was increased in AQP4 KO mice and further increased following treatment with ISO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of FKBP12.6, SERCA2a, and CASQ2 were downregulated and diastolic calcium concentrations were elevated in the AQP4 KO mice, indicative of a calcium leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the myocardium, expressions of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, including ET(A), pPKCɛ, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase p67(phox) were upregulated and associated with downregulation of Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aforementioned changes were exacerbated in response to ISO medication and were attenuated by AMG; however, its treatment effectiveness was less in the AQP4 KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded AQP4 KO caused abnormalities of calcium modulating proteins leading to an exacerbation of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes are likely due to an increase in pro-inflammatory factors which are exacerbated by stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AQP4 KO mice are prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through exacerbating pro-inflammatory factors in the myocardium </plain></SENT>
