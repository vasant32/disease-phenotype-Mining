<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the value of transplacental digoxin therapy for fetal tachyarrhythmia with multiple evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four cases of fetal tachyarrhythmia were diagnosed with fetal echocardiography and treated with transplacental digoxin therapy with an initial dosage of 0.25 mg qd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fetal echocardiography and measurement of maternal serum digoxin concentrations were performed every 5-7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic information was further used for the calculation of three evaluation systems including, Tei index, cardiovascular profile score (CVPS), and umbilical artery resistance index (UARI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dosage of digoxin was adjusted according to the serum concentration, as well as results from three evaluation systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the course of digoxin treatment, our patients show an increase of CVPS and decrease of Tei index and UARI, suggesting the recovery of heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm was restored in 3-10 days in three cases and 42 days in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the time of delivery, the placental transportation efficiency (neonate/mother ratio of serum digoxin concentration) was 76.45-84.31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following delivery, the general conditions of neonates were favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the 4- to 14-month follow-up, reoccurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, neurological deficit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>retarded growth</z:hpo> and development were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transplacental digoxin therapy with combined evaluation of Tei index, CVPS, and UARI systems is useful for treating fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
