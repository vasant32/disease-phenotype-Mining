<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience concerning SDD in a selected population of patients who underwent CA; the outcome was evaluated in terms of feasibility and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 401 CA procedures were performed at our institution between January 2008 and December 2009 in 379 patients (65Â±16 years, 221 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>336 CA procedures (84%) were considered eligible for SDD, after the exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, AV node ablation as well as procedures involving an arterial or transseptal access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a number of clinical and organizational exclusion criteria were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 223 patients were actually discharged on the same day of CA (56% of 401 overall CA procedures): 114 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) and 109 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many patients were excluded before CA due to a limited availability of the day-hospital facility; this occurred more frequently in the year 2008 than 2009 (45 vs. 2, P=0.0001); in the year 2009 the rate of total CA procedures which underwent SDD was of 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, three groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> occurred, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in patients ablated for AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of them were recognized during the postablation CONCLUSION: SDD can be safely performed in most patients undergoing CA for routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may result in a significant impact on daily practice in terms of both organizational improvement and subjective benefit for the patients </plain></SENT>
