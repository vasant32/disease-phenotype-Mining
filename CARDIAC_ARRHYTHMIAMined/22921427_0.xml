<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the influence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (a P-gp inhibitor)--bufadienolides interaction on cardiotoxicity and bufadienolide uptake by the isolated heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in Langendorff isolated perfused guinea-pig hearts by bufadienolides infusion in the absence and presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (250, 500ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> parameters were evaluated by ECG and the content of bufadienolides in heart were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the wide QRS duration and lightly rapid heart rate (HR) were markedly reduced in the early stage of bufadienolide intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the ECG changes characterized by prolonged P-R interval, and slow heart rate and low QRS amplitude in the late stage of bufadienolide intoxication were significantly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the contents of a variety of bufadienolide compounds in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>+bufadienolide group were significantly higher when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reduced the bufadienolide-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> worsened <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> and lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> of bufadienolides partly via increasing the uptake of bufadienolides in heart tissue, which could compromise the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> against bufadienolide intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> may produce dangerous interactions with drugs containing bufadienolides </plain></SENT>
