<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We studied outcomes of uninsured patients prescribed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of patients were prescribed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> because of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or coronary artery revascularization with a predischarge ejection fraction (EF) ≤35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> compliance, events, EF changes, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 134 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> diagnosed at a mean age of 52.7 ± 11.6 years and with a mean EF of 22.5% ± 7.3%, 125 patients (93%) were newly diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 77 patients (57%) with nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and 57 (43%) with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients wore the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> for a mean of 14.1 ± 8.1 hours per day for 72 ± 55 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no shocks or detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (35%) were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were implanted in 33 (38%) of the other 86 patients, whose EF improved to above 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 53 patients with persistent EF ≤35%, 44 patients (83%) received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, 12 (27%) of these 44 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant before 90 days after the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a high lost to follow-up rate in an uninsured population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Wearable defibrillator utilization prevented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant in the subgroup of patients with EF improvement, although there were still premature implants based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Guideline waiting periods </plain></SENT>
