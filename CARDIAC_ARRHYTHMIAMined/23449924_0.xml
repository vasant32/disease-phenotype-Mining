<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 25 (76%) hospitals responded with the details of 111 implanted patients [median 5/hospital (range 1-18)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of follow-up was 12.7 ± 7.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 33 years (range 10-87 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Underlying pathology was primary electrical disease in 43%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> 12%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 20%, ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 14%, idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> 5%, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> 7% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (17%) patients required 20 re-operations, including permanent device explantation in 10 (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four appropriate shocks were delivered in 13 (12%) patients, including 10 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but there were no failures to detect or terminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> above the programmed detection rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one inappropriate shocks were delivered in 17 (15%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-one (80%) were for T-wave over-sensing and 1 (2%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>-wave over-sensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 11 patients who received inappropriate shocks due to T-wave over-sensing were significantly younger than patients who did not (24 ± 10 vs. 37 ± 19 years; P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: The S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> is an important innovation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these data indicate that adverse event rates are significant during early clinical adoption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Important lessons in patient selection, implant technique, and device programming can be learnt from this experience </plain></SENT>
