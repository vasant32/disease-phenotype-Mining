<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the ability of atrioventricular plane displacement to predict inhospital outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent trans-thoracic echocardiography for measurement of the ejection fraction by the Simpson's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atrioventricular plane displacement was measured from the apical views, assessed in four different regions, namely, the septal, lateral, anterior and inferior ones, and the mean value was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a cutoff value to classify patients into a group with atrioventricular plane displacement &lt;10 mm and another with atrioventricular plane displacement &gt; or=10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, patients were classified into those with ejection fraction &lt;40% and others with ejection fraction a 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up during their in-hospital stay for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events, namely, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, post-infarction <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, or mechanical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period (3 +/- 1.5 days), major adverse cardiac events occurred in 16 (72.7%) patients with atrioventricular plane displacement &lt;10 mm, and in 6(8.5%) patients with atrioventricular plane displacement &gt; or =10 mm, p &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An atrioventricular plane displacement below 10 mm was able to predict the occurrence of major events with a sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 91.5%, negative predictive value (NPV) 91.5%, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi>) 72.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, an ejection fraction below 40% predicted the occurrence of major events with a sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 90.1%, NPV 91.4%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53245">PVP</z:chebi> 69.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found a strong correlation between an atrioventricular plane displacement &lt; 10 mm, and an ejection fraction &lt;40%, p &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Left atrioventricular plane displacement below 10 mm, can adequately predict the occurrence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, with a high correlation with ejection fraction below 40% </plain></SENT>
