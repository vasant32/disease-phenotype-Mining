<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Traditional indexes of LV dyssynchrony (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DYS</z:e>) in pts to be resynchronized are sensitive to noise, while the concordance between LV lead position and site of latest mechanical activation is suggested to be, in these patients, clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both aspects, asynchrony and lead position have been addressed separately but unclear is their potential synergistic role in the clinical evolution of CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed clinical and echocardiographic outcome, as well as mid-term prognosis, in a population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients submitted to CRT, stratified according to a novel asynchrony quantitation (temporal uniformity of strain: TUS) method and concordance or not between presumed LV lead position and site of latest mechanical activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TUS was computed in 85 pts (QRS &gt; 120 ms, EF &lt; 0.35) in whom we measured circumferential and longitudinal strains using speckle-tracking 2D-echocardiography before and 3-6 months after CRT, together with triplane apical LV volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Optimal LV lead position in short axis view was defined as concordance of the segment with latest systolic circumferential strain prior-CRT and segment with assumed LV lead position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assumed LV lead position was defined from a chest X-ray obtained 1 day after implantation and scored as anterior, lateral, posterior or inferior using 2 orthogonal views (antero-posterior and lateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following CRT, LV volume decreased (diastolic -8 ± 20%) and EF improved (+6 ± 9%, P &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-way ANOVA revealed TUS improvement post-CRT (+22 ± 68%, P = 0.025), with a clear evidence for more marked asynchrony detectable at circumferential (from 0.53 ± 0.20 to 0.55 ± 0.19) as compared with longitudinal level (from 0.56 ± 0.14 to 0.62 ± 0.14) (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that greater baseline asynchrony, as assessed circumferentially (P = 0.079), together with concordance between LV lead position and site of activation (P = 0.012), besides younger age (P = 0.051), longer QRS duration (P = 0.021) and higher baseline EF (P = 0.04),), but not longitudinal TUS (P = 0.231) did predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause or new episodes of pulmonary or systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> requiring i.v. <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> during a 529 ± 357 days clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DYS</z:e> indexed by circumferential TUS yields CRT benefits, supporting the idea of targeting TUS-measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DYS</z:e> as the informative asynchrony quantitative measurement in CRT pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant predictability in medium-term clinical follow-up of patients to be resynchronized is also associated with concordance between site of latest mechanical activation and presumed LV lead position in the present study </plain></SENT>
