<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to test the hypotheses that Type D personality is associated with biological markers for sympathetic dysregulation.Design: Cross-sectional community-based study.Methods: Type D personality was evaluated by DS-14 in 450 persons (46% men), aged between 30 and 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From a Holter-recording, (mean length 18.3 hours), long-term heart rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and heart rate variability (HRV) were registered as markers of sympathetic dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo>-hypopnoea index, medication, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms were adjusted for.Results: Type D persons had higher long-term averaged heart rate (74 vs. 71 beats/min, p = 0.003), but this difference was attenuated and not significant in the multivariate model (p = 0.078)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an increased prevalence of complex ventricular ectopy (bigeminy, trigeminy, or non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>; 14 vs. 6%, p = 0.005 in multivariate model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRV indices did not differ significantly between those with or without Type D personality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms did not confound these associations.Conclusions: Type D personality is independently associated with a higher likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which may be implicated in the increased cardiovascular risk observed in persons with Type D personality </plain></SENT>
