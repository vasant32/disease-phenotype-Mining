<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : In the nineteenth century, prior to the introduction of the cuff sphygmomanometer, stiffening of arteries was recognized as an indicator of vascular ageing and cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through the twentieth century, views on vascular ageing came to focus on brachial blood pressures and on occlusive atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such focus deflected attention from primary ageing changes, represented by stiffening and dilation of the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: : This review emphasizes the cushioning function of elastic arteries, principally the aorta, now when life expectancy largely exceeds 80 years providing new challenges for medical treatment in the very old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: : First, life expectancy has increased significantly for both sexes and is particularly prolonged after menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, phenotypic changes are noticed such as that the age-related increase of waist circumference and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> is markedly slowed, whereas the concomitant rise in C-reactive protein is enhanced and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> develops in many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third, the systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures rise with age is attenuated or even stopped, as is the degree of arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in very old patients, the main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are cardiovascular, including cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, which differ markedly by causation in men (due to lowered ejection fraction) and women (due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> disorders) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> are observed in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: : No simple linear relationships exist between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these phenotypic variables and the ageing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment goals of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> remain difficult to predict from such data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prevention of cardiovascular risk in the very old is thus influenced by limited evidence and important ethical considerations </plain></SENT>
