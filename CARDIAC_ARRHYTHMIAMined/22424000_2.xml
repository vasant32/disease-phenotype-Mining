<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, trials of hospital administration of IV GIK to patients with ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) have generally not shown favorable effects possibly because of the GIK intervention taking place many hours after ischemic symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A trial of GIK used in the very first hours of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been needed, consistent with the timing of benefit seen in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The IMMEDIATE Trial tested whether, if given very early, GIK could have the impact seen in experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, distinct from prior trials, IMMEDIATE tested the impact of GIK (1) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS), rather than only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, and (2) administered in prehospital emergency medical service settings, rather than later, in hospitals, after emergency department evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The IMMEDIATE Trial was an emergency medical service-based randomized placebo-controlled clinical effectiveness trial conducted in 13 cities across the United States that enrolled 911 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eligible were patients 30 years or older for whom a paramedic performed a 12-lead electrocardiogram to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or other symptoms suggestive of ACS for whom electrocardiograph-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> time-insensitive predictive instrument indicated a â‰¥75% probability of ACS, and/or the thrombolytic predictive instrument indicated the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, or if local criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> notification of receiving hospitals were met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prehospital IV GIK or placebo was started immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prespecified were the primary end point of progression of ACS to infarction and, as major secondary end points, the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> or in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, 30-day mortality, or hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analyses were planned on an intent-to-treat basis, on a modified intent-to-treat group who were confirmed in emergency departments to have ACS, and for participants presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IMMEDIATE Trial tested whether GIK, when administered as early as possible in the course of ACS by paramedics using <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> time-insensitive predictive instrument and thrombolytic predictive instrument decision support, would reduce progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, mortality, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It also tested whether it would provide clinical and pathophysiologic information on GIK's biological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
