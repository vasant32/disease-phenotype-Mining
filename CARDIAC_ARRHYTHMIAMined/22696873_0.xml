<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor type-3 (5-HT3) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> are widely used for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (CINV) and regarded to have a high safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, several <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> have been reported due to administration of 5-HT3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only prolongation of QT interval has been investigated as an index of potential for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in adult patients using 5-HT3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) has been proposed as a more reliable determinant of arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the effects of palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT3 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, on the T-wave peak to T-wave end (TpTe) interval which has been proposed as a reliable index of spatial TDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients (aged: 57 +/- 12 years) who were scheduled to receive emetogenic chemotherapy were included to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received 8 mg intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> followed by a single dose of 0.25 mg intravenous palonosetron administered over 30 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A second ECG was performed 30 minutes after the administration of palonosetron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Indices of cardiac repolarization and TDR before and after the administration of palonosetron were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison with baseline there was no statistically significant change in any of the heart rate-corrected parameters, including QT(c) (lead V5), QT(maxc), QT(minc), QT(cd), TpTe (V5), TpTe(max), TpTe(min), TpTe(d) and TpTe/QT (V5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Palonosetron does not have any significant effect on QT(c) and TpTe intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It might be the drug of choice for prophylaxis of CINV in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients receiving chemotherapy with known cardiotoxic potential or who have pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> that predispose them to drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
