<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is a well-recognized entity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are poorly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Certain chemotherapeutic regimes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, particularly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data on patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant; BMT) from 1998 to 2005 and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) during the same hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Fisher χ2 test and the Student t test were used for comparison of categorical and continuous variables, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the period of 1998-2005, there were 1221 BMTs, 62 (5.1%) of which were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Melphalan-based regimens demonstrated a significantly higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> than any other chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Out of 438 patients who received melphalan, 48 (11%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n = 35) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> (n = 13) during the same hospital admission, and 390 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> were older, had higher baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, larger size of the left atrium, and more cardiac comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> was associated with greater length of stay (24.9 ± 8.9 d vs 19.6 ± 5.8 days, P&lt;0.0001), even after adjustment for comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>Supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, complicates about 5% of chemotherapeutic treatments used with BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Melphalan is the most arrhythmogenic agent, and is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in 11% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> results in about a 4-day increase in the length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
