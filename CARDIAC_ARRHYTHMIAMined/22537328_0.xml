<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Right precordial (V1-3) elevated electrode placement ECG (EEP-ECG) is often used in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the specificity of this has only been studied in smaller studies in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to study this in a larger European population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two different populations consisting of healthy subjects were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 340 subjects were included, 80% were men, the median age was 43 year (interquartile range: 31-51) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were of European ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No type 1 ECG patterns were identified but 16 (4.7%) subjects with a type 2 ECG and 32 (9.4%) subjects with a type 3 ECG were identified in any lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total 43 (13%) subjects had any BrS ECG pattern in any lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 100% (one-sided 97.5% CI: 99%) for the use of EEP-ECG to uncover type 1 pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For type 2 pattern the specificity was 95% (95% CI: 92-97%) and for type 3 pattern 91% (95% CI: 88-94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated electrode placement ECG in the diagnosis of BrS seems to have a very high specificity with regards to the finding of a type 1 ECG pattern in a European population; conversely a finding of a type 2 or 3 pattern is of a significantly lower specificity and should perhaps be disregarded </plain></SENT>
