<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on contemporary treatment patterns and outcomes associated with AF in clinical practice are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> is a multicenter, prospective, ambulatory-based registry of incident and prevalent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The registry will be a nationwide collaboration of health care providers, including internists, primary care physicians, cardiologists, and electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial target enrollment is approximately 10,000 patients to be recruited from approximately 200 US outpatient practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enrolled patients will be observed for ≥2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A patient-reported outcomes substudy in ≥1,500 patients will provide serial quality-of-life assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The goal is to characterize treatment and outcomes of patients with AF, thereby promoting better quality of AF care and improved patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> will provide insights into "real-world" treatment including rate and rhythm control, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, transitions to new therapies, and clinical and patient-centered outcomes among patients with AF in community practice settings (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01165710) </plain></SENT>
