<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children aged between 0 and 18 years who received combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> for persistent monotherapy resistance tachyarrhythmia between 2007 and 2011 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated by review of clinical signs and symptoms, 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitorization, liver enzymes, thyroid function tests, chest x-ray, and ophthalmologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (15 male and 10 female) were enrolled in this study with a mean age of 17.9 months (0-132) and a mean weight of 8.65 kg (2.2-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients, treatment was started before their first age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tachyarrhythmia persisted in two patients despite combination therapy, and treatment regimen was changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete control of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was achieved within the first 2 months of combination treatment in 20 patients, whereas in the remaining three patients short attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> who responded to dose increases were controlled beyond 2 months of treatment and no recurrence were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, success of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> combination treatment was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild elevation in thyroid-stimulating hormone level was observed in one patient that required discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> is an effective and safe option for the treatment of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in neonates and infants, and may serve as a bridge to ablation therapy in older children </plain></SENT>
