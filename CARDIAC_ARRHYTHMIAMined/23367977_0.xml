<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show for a simple model of excitable cardiac tissue that a transition to alternans--a beat-to-beat temporal alternation in the duration of cardiac excitation--can also induce a transition in the spiral core motion that is related to the presence of synchronization defect lines (SDLs) or nodal lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While this is similar to what has been predicted and indeed observed for complex-oscillatory media close to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, we find important qualitative differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, single straight SDLs rotate and induce an additional nonresonant frequency characterizing the core motion of the attached spiral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyze this behavior quantitatively as a function of the steepness of the restitution curve and show that the velocity and the directionality of the core motion vary monotonically with the control parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings agree with recent observations in rat heart tissue cultures indicating that the described behavior is of rather general nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, it could play an important role in the context of potentially life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> for which alternans and spiral waves are known precursors </plain></SENT>
