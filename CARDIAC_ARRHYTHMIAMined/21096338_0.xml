<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, this information requires special equipment and programs to monitor them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These programs process and react to the continuous entry of data from different origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze the data produced by these biomedical devices, in this case the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Processing uses a neural classifier, Kohonen competitive neural networks, detecting if the ECG shows any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fact, it is possible to classify an ECG signal and thereby detect if it is exhibiting or not any alteration, according to normality </plain></SENT>
