<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T-wave alternans (TWA), an electrophysiologic phenomenon associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, is usually detected from selected ECG leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TWA amplitude measured in the 12-standard and the 3-orthogonal (vectorcardiographic) leads were compared here to identify which lead system yields a more adequate detection of TWA as a noninvasive marker for cardiac vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our adaptive match filter (AMF) was applied to exercise ECG tracings from 58 patients with an implanted cardiac defibrillator, 29 of which had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> during follow-up (cases), while the remaining 29 were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two kinds of TWA indexes were considered, the single-lead indexes, defined as the mean TWA amplitude over each lead (MTWAA), and lead-system indexes, defined as the mean and the maximum MTWAA values over the standard leads and over the orthogonal leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher TWA in the cases versus controls was identified only occasionally by the single-lead indexes (odds ratio: 1.0-9.9, sensitivity: 24-76%, specificity: 76-86%), and consistently by the lead-system indexes (odds ratio: 4.5-8.3, sensitivity: 57-72%, specificity: 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter indexes also showed a significant correlation (0.65-0.83) between standard and orthogonal leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence, when using the AMF, TWA should be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads of a system to compute the lead-system indexes, which provide a more reliable TWA identification than single-lead indexes, and a better discrimination of patients at increased risk of cardiac instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standard and the orthogonal leads can be considered equivalent for TWA identification, so that TWA analysis can be limited to one-lead system </plain></SENT>
