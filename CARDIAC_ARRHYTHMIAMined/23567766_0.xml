<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the last years, remote monitoring systems have been continuously updated and implemented by new algorithms to ensure proper and highly individualized management of patients with pacemakers or implantable defibrillators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical history of patients with implantable devices is frequently complicated by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, often coexisting in the same subject, which are frequently responsible for major events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients, therefore, are those who benefit most from the remote monitoring of implantable devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, remote monitoring allows the early detection of even short-term or asymptomatic arrhythmic episodes with a significant impact on treatment choices about thromboembolic and antiarrhythmic prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, wearing devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy, remote monitoring allows a multiparametric evaluation on the clinical status of the patient including determination of heart rate variability, intrathoracic impedance, physical activity, weight and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The early detection of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes or significant changes in any of the parameters recorded by remote control can identify patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> events and allow us to change therapy quickly and adequately </plain></SENT>
