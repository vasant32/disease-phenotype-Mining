<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the degree of left atrial structural remodeling (LA-SRM) in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the impact of LA-SRM on LVEF improvement in patients undergoing ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: We categorized 384 patients into 2 groups based on their cardiac function: reduced LVEF group (LVEF ≤50%; n = 105) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEF group (LVEF &gt; 50%; n = 279) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LVEF was determined prior and mean 8 ± 3 months after catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Percentage of LA-SRM was quantified using LGE-MRI and patients were classified into 4 groups based on the amount of structural remodeling in their LA wall: minimal ≤ 5%, mild = 5-20%, moderate = 20-35%, and extensive ≥ 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average preablation LA-SRM (21.5 ± 13.2% vs 15.4 ± 10.0%; P &lt; 0.001) was significantly higher in reduced LVEF group than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 105 patients with reduced LVEF, while there was a modest 11.7 ± 8.4% average increase in LVEF following ablation, the greatest increase was seen in patients with less extensive LA-SRM (minimal = 19.3 ± 5.1%, n = 3, P = 0.02 and mild = 16.6 ± 9.9%, n = 48, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate and extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> had an average EF improvement of 8.7 ± 11.1% and 2.8 ± 6.4%, respectively (n = 39, P &lt; 0.001 and n = 15, P = 0.11, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with LV systolic dysfunction displayed a comparatively greater LA-SRM than patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LVEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lesser LA-SRM experienced a greater improvement in LVEF after catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
