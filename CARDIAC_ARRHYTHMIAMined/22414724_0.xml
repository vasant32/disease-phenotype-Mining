<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients admitted to one of five Neurology Departments in Poland for diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding awareness of cerebrovascular risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed between November 1 and December 31,2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 481 patients were included in the study (59.7% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proper definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was given by 90.3 and 60.5% of respondents, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was reported as a risk factor by 91.1% of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% knew that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and smoking are risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but only one third identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as a risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was recognized as a risk factor by 8.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent of participants did not know any symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> signs was worse by participants from rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten percent identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0004372'>disturbances of consciousness</z:hpo>, numbness, and dizziness as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of fundamental risk factors was sufficiently good, but recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms was unsatisfactory, particularly in rural areas </plain></SENT>
