<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is of great importance to develop robust in silico tools to predict potential hERG blockers in the early stages of drug discovery and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein we described comprehensive approaches to assess the discrimination of hERG-active and -inactive compounds by combining quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, pharmacophore analysis, and molecular docking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our consensus models demonstrated high-predictive capacity and improved enrichment and could correctly classify 91.8% of 147 hERG blockers from 351 inactives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further enhance our modeling effort, hERG homology models were constructed, and molecular docking studies were conducted, resulting in high correlations (R² = 0.81) between predicted and experimental pIC₅₀s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We expect our unique models can be applied to efficient screening for hERG blockades, and our extensive understanding of the hERG-inhibitor interactions will facilitate the rational design of drugs devoid of hERG channel activity and hence with reduced cardiac toxicities </plain></SENT>
