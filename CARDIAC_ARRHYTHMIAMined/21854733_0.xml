<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MMP-7, -8 and -9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) were analysed in blood samples obtained from 51 patients resuscitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The samples were taken at 24 and 48 h from restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biomarker levels were compared between patients (N=51) and healthy controls (N=10) and between patients who did (N=30) and patients who did not (N=21) receive mild therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MMP-7 (median 0.47 ng/ml), MMP-8 (median 31.16 ng/ml) and MMP-9 (median 253.00 ng/ml) levels were elevated and TIMP-1 levels suppressed (median 78.50 ng/ml) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> patients as compared with healthy controls at 24h from ROSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment associated with attenuated elevation of MMP-9 (p=0.001) but not MMP-8 (p=0.02) or MMP-7 (p=0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of MMPs -7, -8 and -9 correlated with the leukocyte count but not with C-reactive protein (CRP) or neurone-specific enolase (NSE) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the systemic levels of MMP-7, -8 and -9 but not TIMP-1 are elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> patients in the 48 h post-resuscitation period relative to the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> had lower MMP-9 levels compared to non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treated patients, which generates hypothesis about attenuation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
