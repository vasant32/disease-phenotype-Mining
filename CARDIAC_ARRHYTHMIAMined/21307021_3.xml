<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess remote-controlled magnetic (RCM) mapping and ablation of RVOT <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e> utilizing a soft magnetic catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Mapping and ablation of RVOT VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e> were performed using the magnetic navigation system (MNS, Niobe II, Stereotaxis, St Louis, MO) in conjunction with a cardiodrive motor unit (Stereotaxis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A soft magnetic catheter (Celsius RMT, 4 mm solid tip, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) was navigated to the RVOT using a sequence of pre-installed magnetic vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was defined as successful RCM VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other parameters observed included RCM RVOT accessibility, mapping-induced mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e>, fluoroscopy time, complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen consecutive patients (mean age: 50 ± 14 years; 10 females, 6 RVOT VT) underwent RCM mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RVOT was reached in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients utilizing solely the MNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful RCM RVOT ablation was achieved in {12 of 13} (92.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean procedure and fluoroscopy times were 116.5 ± 48.9 and 7.5 ± 4.3 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Catheter-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e> during RVOT mapping were observed in {1 in 13} patients (7.7%, three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VES</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 252 ± 211 days, clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence was observed in {1 in 13} (7.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Automatic RCM RVOT access is feasible, while RVOT mapping and ablation appear to be safe, fast, and effective </plain></SENT>
