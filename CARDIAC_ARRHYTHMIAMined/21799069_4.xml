<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF is associated with atrial conduction disturbances caused by electrical and/or structural remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that AF suppresses expression of the gap junction protein connexin (Cx) 43 and that Cx43 gene transfer to both atria would prevent persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first aim of this study was to assess whether AF is associated with connexin remodelling in a porcine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A strategy to suppress persistent AF by gene therapy was then developed and evaluated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: AF was induced in domestic pigs via atrial burst pacing, causing a 62.4% reduction in atrial Cx43 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adenoviruses encoding for Cx43 (AdCx43) or green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) were injected into both atria, followed by epicardial electroporation to enhance transgene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combining direct injection of adenoviruses with electroporation achieved GFP reporter gene expression in ∼50% of atrial cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AdCx43-treated animals exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in atrial Cx43 protein content and did not develop persistent AF during the observation period of 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, control animals developed persistent AF within 7.4 ± 0.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rapid ventricular heart rates during AF led to deterioration of cardiac function in control pigs but not in pigs treated with AdCx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the contribution of Cx43 to the pathophysiology of AF and demonstrate the viability of gene therapy for prevention of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
