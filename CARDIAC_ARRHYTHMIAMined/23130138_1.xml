<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relationship with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, however, is less well studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We sought to assess the long-term relations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in the Women's Health Study of female health professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured psychological symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incident AF was assessed annually and verified through medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 30 746 women without history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or AF, 771 cases of AF occurred during a median follow-up of 125 months (interquartile range, 117-130 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> was not associated with AF risk in age-stratified (P=0.61 for linear trend) or multivariable proportional-hazards models that included antidepressant use (P=0.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A proxy measure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, consisting of Mental Health Inventory-5 score &lt;53, antidepressant use, or both, was also not associated with AF risk in multivariable models (hazard ratio=0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.25; P=0.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In post hoc analyses of individual symptoms from the Mental Health Inventory-5, positive affect, "feeling happy some/a good bit of the time," was associated with reduced risk of AF (hazard ratio=0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.99; P=0.04); other depressive and anxious symptoms were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of women without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> and specific depressive symptoms were unrelated to AF risk </plain></SENT>
