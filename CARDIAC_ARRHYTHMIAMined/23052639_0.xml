<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this is only due to the reduction in ventricular heart rate and blood pressure or whether other effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> may be involved is currently elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> in arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C57Bl/6 mice were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> was investigated using a mouse photochemical injury model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> inhibited carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was impaired in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi>-treated mice (P &lt; 0.05), and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1), an inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, was reduced in the arterial wall (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the level of tissue factor (TF), the main trigger of the coagulation cascade, and that of its physiological inhibitor, TF pathway inhibitor, did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, coagulation times as measured by prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in vivo through inhibition of platelet aggregation and PAI1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect occurs within the range of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> concentrations measured in patients, and may represent a beneficial pleiotropic effect of this drug </plain></SENT>
