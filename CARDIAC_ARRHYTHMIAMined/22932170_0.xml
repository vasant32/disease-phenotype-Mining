<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An uncontrolled open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the antiviral activity, and safety of inhaled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">zanamivir</z:chebi> (as Rotadisk via Diskhaler device); 10 mg administered twice daily for 5 days in subjects ≥ 12 years old with ILI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 400 patients ≥ 12 years old were screened from 11 centers in seven provinces from March 2010 to January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and ninety-two patients who took at least one dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">zanamivir</z:chebi> were entered into the safety analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 33.8 years and 50% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were the most common comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the reported adverse events, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, nasal ache, muscle ache, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, occurred in less than 1% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mild sinus bradycadia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred in four subjects (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the adverse events were mild and did not require any change of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse events (SAE) or fatal cases were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bronchospasm</z:e> was found in a 38 years old woman whose symptoms disappeared after stopping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">zanamivir</z:chebi> and without additional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 61 influenza virus isolates (43 before enrollment, 18 during treatment) proved to be sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">zanamivir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">Zanamivir</z:chebi> is well tolerated by Chinese adolescents and adults with ILIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence for the emergence of drug-resistant isolates during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50663">zanamivir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
