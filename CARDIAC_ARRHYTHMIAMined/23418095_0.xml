<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fertile eggs were injected prior to incubation with the following doses of the PCB mixture: untreated, sham, 0.0, 0.03, 0.08, 0.30, 0.50, 0.70, and 2.06 µg PCBs/g egg wt (TEQ range of 0.004-0.266 ng/g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were untreated and sham-control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embryonic development was monitored throughout incubation and chicks were necropsied at hatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hatchability followed a dose-dependent curve with significant (p&lt;0.05) mortality above the 0.50 µg PCBs/g egg wt treatment compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The LD(50) of this PCB mixture in hatchling chicks was estimated as 0.40 µg/g egg wt (0.052 ng TEQ/g egg weight) based on the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed at embryonic day (ED) 14 of development in embryos treated at concentrations of 0.50 µg/g egg wt and above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis was utilized to characterize any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> increased across treatments in a dose-dependent manner compared to control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identified abnormalities included the absence of the trabeculated layer of the ventricular wall, ventricular dilation, thinning of the ventricular walls, malformation of the septal wall, and most commonly, absence of the compact layer of the ventricular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chick heart width, depth, total area, compact layer depth, septal width, chamber area, and ventricular wall dimensions did not differ across treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study supports prior reports of adverse developmental effects of PCBs on cardiovascular systems in birds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the eggs hatched, the measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> suggest potential deleterious long-term impacts on individual health and fitness </plain></SENT>
