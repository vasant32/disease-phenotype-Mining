<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To document symptomatic episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> with traditional methods such as24 h Holter monitoring (HM) or loop recorders remains a big challenge in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials with patient-activated electrocardiography (ECG) recorders show increased diagnostic yield in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, studies in the paediatric population are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We want to present a first experience with an event-recording system Omron HeartScan in children with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty paediatric patients (age 4-16 years) were followed with the Omron at our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiogram, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline 12-lead ECG and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 24 h HM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications with regard to monitoring were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of them also had episodes of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average of palpitation episodes in the past 3 months was 13.2 ± 8.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the study population was 9.7 ± 2.3 years [17 males (56.7 %)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 30) a diagnostic event could be recorded with the studied system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) and underwent catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients (n = 26; 87%) were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> additionally had episodes of pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the patients could be diagnosed with previous 24 h HM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This event recorder has a high diagnostic yield in the childhood population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The children enjoyed the ease of using the system under daily-life conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In this study the system was able to record a diagnostic event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
