<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assesses implant rates, therapy, adverse events, and survival gain in the elderly primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1395 patients treated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> at the Leiden University Medical Center were included and allocated to three groups according to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endpoints consisted of appropriate shocks and survival gain, defined as the time following first appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 2.9 ± 2.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one per cent of the patients were &lt;65 years, 35% were 65-74 years, and 14% were ≥75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior to the year 2000, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were implanted in patients ≥75 years; 29% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> were implanted in patients 65-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 2005, 53% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients were ≥65 years at the time of implant, including 16% aged ≥75 years (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative incidence of appropriate shocks was 19% for patients &lt;65 years, 23% for patients 65-74 years, and 13% for patients ≥75 years (P = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1-year following appropriate shock, cumulative incidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 35% for patients ≥75 years as compared with 7% for patients &lt;65 years (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In routine clinical practice, the percentage of patients ≥75 years receiving an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary prevention is increasing </plain></SENT>
