<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To report our experience using single high dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for the cardioversion of recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> to sinus rhythm in patient presenting with symptoms within 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 48 patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> presenting to the emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were admitted to the cardiology ward and treated with single high oral dose (30 mg/kg) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of patients was 60.1 ± 4.4 years and 54% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (90%) of them had symptoms &lt;24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The common risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (73%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 48 patients, 47 (98%) were chemically cardioverted to sinus rhythm in 6.3 ± 0.8h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean pre-treatment heart rate and blood pressure were 154/min and 159.3/88.0 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest heart rate and blood pressure were 43/min and 122.5/80.9 mmHg respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was overall well tolerated except in three patients having self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital discharge occurred in less than 24h after presentation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Single high dose oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> is safe and highly effective for patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> eligible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> chemical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
