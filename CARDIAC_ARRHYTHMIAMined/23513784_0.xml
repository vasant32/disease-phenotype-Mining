<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initial therapy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) should always include adequate antithrombotic treatment and control of the ventricular rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on the patient's course, this strategy may prove insufficient and may then be supplemented by rhythm control using drugs or interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical frustration came by clinical trials that have demonstrated that the strategy of maintaining sinus rhythm has no demonstrable value when compared with the "laissez-faire" approach of leaving AF to a permanent form and controlling ventricular rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disappointing findings can be considered as paradoxical when considering the severe complications associated with AF in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New anti-arrhythmic approaches might offer added value but this is still a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-pharmacological interventions to prevent AF recurrences or to limit its expression have been substantially developed in the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation techniques, usually done percutaneously using a catheter, have proved successful n the treatment of AF, particularly by reducing the symptomatic burden associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, to such an extent that a 'cure' may be achieved in some patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
