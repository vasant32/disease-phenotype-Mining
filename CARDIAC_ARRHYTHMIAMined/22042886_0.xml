<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) often have kidney dysfunction, less is known about the association between AF and kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess changes in kidney function after catheter ablation of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who underwent catheter ablation of AF were recruited for the present prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was evaluated before and 1 year after the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three hundred eighty-six patients (paroxysmal AF, 135; persistent AF, 106; longstanding persistent AF, 145) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their baseline eGFR was 68 ± 14 mL · min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six percent and 26% of patients had eGFR of 60 to 89 and 30 to 59 mL · min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 278 patients (72%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> free over a 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, eGFR increased 3 months later and was maintained until 1 year, whereas in patients with recurrences, eGFR had decreased over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in eGFR over 1 year in patients free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> differed significantly compared with those with recurrences (3 ± 8 versus -2 ± 8 mL · min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2); P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> quartiles of baseline eGFR, changes in eGFR over 1 year after the ablation were greater in patients free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> compared with those with recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elimination of AF by catheter ablation was associated with improvement of kidney function over a 1-year follow-up in patients with mild to moderate kidney dysfunction </plain></SENT>
