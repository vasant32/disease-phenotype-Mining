<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to decide which one of using electrocautery hook and <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip is the appropriate procedure for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006089'>palmar hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> by assessing the compensatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> (CS) and quality of life (QOL) of patients after sympathetic block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2007 to August 2010, 120 patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006089'>palmar hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> were randomly divided into two groups, electrocautery hook group (60 patients) and <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip group (60 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated by sympathetic block at T4 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CS was graded based on severity and location; the QOL was classified to 5 different levels based upon the summed total scores (range from 20 to 100) before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variables were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative follow-up period was 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients in electrocautery hook group and 1 patient in <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip group had a unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> on chest X-ray, but none of them was necessary to have chest drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither perioperative mortality nor serious complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or arrest were observed during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> occured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CS was not more common in patients in <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip group than in those in electrocautery hook group (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moderate and severe CS was few in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and there was no significant difference between two groups (P = 0.193) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients feel a notable improvement of the the QOL; nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.588) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both electrocautery hook and <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip used for sympathetic block at the T4 level are effective, safe, and minimally invasive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006089'>palmar hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because of the lower severity of CS and the similar improvements in the QOL after operation, we prefer to use of <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> clip for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0006089'>palmar hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
