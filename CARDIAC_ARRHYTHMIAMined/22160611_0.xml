<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reports on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) of children and adolescents treated with stimulant agents have raised concerns regarding the need for cardiovascular monitoring and risk stratification schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac ventricular late potentials (LPs) represent delayed ventricular activation that might predispose to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and SCD in cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LPs have not previously been measured in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LPs were measured in 18 physically healthy <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> children (5 girls and 13 boys, age 11.9 ± 2.5 years, treatment duration 2.6 ± 1.9 years) before and 2 h after oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were detected and LPs were found to be within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this preliminary small-scale study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> in physically healthy children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> was not associated with cardiac ventricular LPs, suggesting the safety of the agent in this age group </plain></SENT>
