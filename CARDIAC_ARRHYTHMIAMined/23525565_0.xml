<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cardiomyocytes, increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations exert prominent positive inotropic effects, that is, they increase myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Owing to this feature, two CGs, namely digoxin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi>, have extensively been used in the past for the treatment of several cardiac conditions, including distinct types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as well as contractility disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, digoxin is approved by the FDA and indicated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> with rapid ventricular response, whereas the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi> has been discontinued in several Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, CGs have been suggested to exert potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects, notably as they appear to increase the immunogenicity of dying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this Trial Watch, we summarize the mechanisms that underpin the unsuspected anticancer potential of CGs and discuss the progress of clinical studies that have evaluated/are evaluating the safety and efficacy of CGs for oncological indications </plain></SENT>
