<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein reconnection after pulmonary vein isolation is common and is usually associated with recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging after radiofrequency ablation to investigate the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pulmonary vein isolation results from a combination of irreversible and reversible atrial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Delayed enhancement (DE; representing areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> tissue injury/<z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>) and T2-weighted (representing tissue water content, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>) cardiac magnetic resonance scans were performed before, immediately after (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>), and later than 3 months (late) after pulmonary vein isolation in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> undergoing wide-area circumferential ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were analyzed as pairs of pulmonary veins to quantify the percentage of circumferential antral encirclement composed of DE, T2, and combined DE+T2 signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 25 patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> free at 11-month follow-up (interquartile range, 8-16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients had higher DE (71±6.0%) and lower T2 signal (72±7.8%) encirclement on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> scans compared with recurrences (DE, 55±9.1%; T2, 85±6.3%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients maintaining sinus rhythm had a lesser decline in DE between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> scans compared with recurrences (71±6.0% and 60±5.8% versus 55±9.1% and 34±7.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of encirclement by a combination of DE+T2 was almost similar in both groups on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> scans (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> free, 89±5.4%; recurrences, 92±4.8%) but different on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> scans (60±5.7% versus 34±7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher T2 signal on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> scans and greater decline in DE on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> imaging in patients with recurrences suggest that they have more reversible tissue injury, providing a potential mechanism for pulmonary vein reconnection, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
