<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They often suffer from serious illnesses and have great <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty in walking</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare remote pacemaker monitoring with in-home checks of pacemakers, in terms of applicability, efficacy, and cost in a selected population of debilitated elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 72 subjects (mean age 87 ± 8 years) among elderly debilitated patients with Medtronic pacemakers, compatible with the Carelink(®) remote monitoring system (13 patients with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker; 59 patients with single-lead VDD pacemaker) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remote follow-up was compared with in-home checks performed by nurses in 326 patients in similar clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 190 transmissions were received by remote monitoring (mean transmissions per month: 7.0; mean per patient: 2.6; range 1-6) during 27 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this period, seven pacemakers were replaced owing to battery exhaustion, after a mean of 6.7 years from implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of atrial or ventricular high-rate episodes was reported in 98 transmissions (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients died (annual mortality: 11.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On comparing the costs borne by the hospital for in-home checks, both for medical personnel and transportation, the estimated average saving was €32 per year per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the remote follow-up of pacemakers is a reliable, effective, and cost-saving procedure in elderly, debilitated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, remote controls provided an accurate and early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
