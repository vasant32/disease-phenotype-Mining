<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is a frequent event during septic shock and may mimic a cardiogenic shock state with <z:mp ids='MP_0003393'>decreased cardiac output</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, data are scarce regarding the myocardial effects of vasopressors used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors compared the effects of three commonly used vasopressors acting on different adrenergic receptors on myocardial function in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> of septic shock, as explored with conductance catheter and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Septic shock was induced in rats by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen hours after septic insult, vasopressors were titrated to increase mean arterial pressure by 20% compared with baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> and systolodiastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> improved mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and preload recruitable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> work, a load-independent measure of systolic function, as well as diastolic function and ventriculoarterial coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, myocardial oxygen consumption, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence were furthermore increased in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, a peripheral α-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, exhibited deleterious effects on systolodiastolic function and ventriculoarterial coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conductance catheter and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography yielded identical results with regard to myocardial function evolution under vasopressor treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi>, a drug without β-1 effects, was associated with decreased ventricular performance and ventriculoarterial uncoupling, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> improved global hemodynamics and myocardial function in severely hypokinetic and hypotensive experimental septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> was associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> appears to be a more reliable and safer strategy as a first-line therapy in this particular setting </plain></SENT>
