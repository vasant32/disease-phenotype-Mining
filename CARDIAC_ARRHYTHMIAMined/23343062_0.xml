<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of peginesatide, as compared with another ESA, darbepoetin, in 983 such patients who were not undergoing dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In two randomized, controlled, open-label studies (PEARL 1 and 2), patients received peginesatide once a month, at a starting dose of 0.025 mg or 0.04 mg per kilogram of body weight, or darbepoetin once every 2 weeks, at a starting dose of 0.75 Î¼g per kilogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses of both drugs were adjusted to achieve and maintain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels between 11.0 and 12.0 g per deciliter for 52 weeks or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy end point was the mean change from the baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level to the mean level during the evaluation period; noninferiority was established if the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5% confidence interval was -1.0 g per deciliter or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular safety was evaluated on the basis of an adjudicated composite end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both studies and at both starting doses, peginesatide was noninferior to darbepoetin in increasing and maintaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean differences in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level with peginesatide as compared with darbepoetin in PEARL 1 were 0.03 g per deciliter (97.5% confidence interval [CI], -0.19 to 0.26) for the lower starting dose of peginesatide and 0.26 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, 0.04 to 0.48) for the higher starting dose, and in PEARL 2 they were 0.14 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, -0.09 to 0.36) and 0.31 g per deciliter (97.5% CI, 0.08 to 0.54), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for the cardiovascular safety end point was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.81) for peginesatide relative to darbepoetin, with higher incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> with peginesatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of peginesatide (administered monthly) was similar to that of darbepoetin (administered every 2 weeks) in increasing and maintaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, cardiovascular events and mortality were increased with peginesatide in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> who were not undergoing dialysis </plain></SENT>
