<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is the evaluation of its incidence, and to search predictor factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: From May 2004 to May 2005, 133 patients (58.5Â±11.2years) are retrospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a stay in intensive care unit, they go to cardiac re-adaptation unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty among them made at least one episode of AF, during the first month after the infraction (FA+ group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other one kept a sinusal rhythm (FA- group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The FA is associated with age (P&lt;0.001), <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> (P&lt;0.016), no smoking status (P&lt;0.025) and ejection fraction less than 45% (P&lt;0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But left atrium <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is the only independent predictor factor of FA occur, as our study (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AF is a frequent complication during the first month following a myocardial infraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The only identified predictor factor is left atrium <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
