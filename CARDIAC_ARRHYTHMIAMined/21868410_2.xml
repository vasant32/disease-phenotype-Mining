<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Some transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) findings are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate and compare the accuracy of CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc in the prediction of these findings and test the additive value of transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)-derived parameters as a possible refinement for these classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional study of 405 consecutive patients who underwent TTE and TEE evaluation during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> risk assessment was performed using the CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores, alone and alongside with the addition of two TTE-derived parameters (left atrium area and left ventricle global systolic function) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons regarding the presence of left atrial appendage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (LAA T), dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), and left atrial appendage (LAA) low flow velocities (LFV) were performed using receiver operating characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In low-risk patients, as assessed through the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score and CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores plus echo parameters, no high-risk features were found on TEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects classified as low risk using CHADS(2), this figure rose to 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc in the prediction of LAA T, dense SEC, and LAA LFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition of TTE-derived parameters to the previous clinical-risk scores resulted in improved prediction of the TEE endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the use of TTE-derived parameters may be a valuable way of refining the available clinical risk schemes for the detection of surrogate markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies using clinical endpoints will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
