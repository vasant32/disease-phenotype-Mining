<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because mutations in RYR2 or in CASQ2 are not retrieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> cases, we searched for mutations in the physiological protein partners of RyR2 and CSQ2 in a large cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patients with no detected mutation in these two genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on a candidate gene approach, we focused our investigations on triadin and junctin, two proteins that link RyR2 and CSQ2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the triadin (TRDN) and in the junctin (ASPH) genes were searched in a cohort of 97 CPVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families, but no mutation was found in junctin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two TRDN mutations, a 4 bp deletion and a nonsense mutation, resulted in premature stop codons; the third mutation, a p.T59R missense mutation, was further studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the p.T59R mutant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular retention and degradation of the mutant protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed after in vivo expression of the mutant triadin in triadin knock-out mice by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this work, we identified TRDN as a new gene responsible for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutations identified in the two families lead to the absence of the protein, thereby demonstrating the importance of triadin for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function of the cardiac calcium release complex in humans </plain></SENT>
