<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Analysis of two prospectively collected datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> dataset including patients admitted to one of 12 hospitals around the United Kingdom between 2009 and 2011; Edinburgh <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> study cohort including patients admitted to NHS Lothian Hospitals between 2005 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: 1343 patients admitted to hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> and 1631 patients admitted with community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios for cardiovascular events at one year (defined as hospital admissions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>) and admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, non-ST elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause and cardiovascular mortality at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 268 cardiovascular events occurred in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> cohort and 171 in the community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> cohort over one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, clarithromycin use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome-hazard ratios 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.97) and 1.67 (1.04 to 2.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, clarithromycin use in community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.68, 1.18 to 2.38) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (1.65, 0.97 to 2.80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between clarithromycin use and cardiovascular events persisted after matching for the propensity to receive clarithromycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between clarithromycin use and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 1.02 to 2.26) but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality (1.16, 0.90 to 1.51) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between clarithromycin use in community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Longer durations of clarithromycin use were associated with more cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Use of Î² <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24995">lactam</z:chebi> antibiotics or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> was not associated with increased cardiovascular events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, suggesting an effect specific to clarithromycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of clarithromycin in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> or community acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> may be associated with increased cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
