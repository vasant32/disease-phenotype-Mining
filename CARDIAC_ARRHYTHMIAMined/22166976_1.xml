<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously we showed that 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E(2)) and/or the xenoestrogen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33216">bisphenol A</z:chebi> (BPA) alter ventricular myocyte Ca(2+) handing, resulting in increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a female-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the roles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors (ER) in mediating the rapid contractile and arrhythmogenic effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contractility was used as an index to assess the impact of E(2) or BPA on Ca(2+) handling in rodent ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration-response curve for the stimulatory effects of BPA and E(2) on female myocyte was inverted-U shaped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detectable effects for each compound were observed at 10(-12) M, and the most efficacious concentrations for each were at 10(-9) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to E(2) and BPA was not observed in male myocytes and was abolished in myocytes from ovariectomized females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis using protein-conjugated E(2) suggests that these rapid actions are induced by membrane-associated receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis using selective ER <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and a genetic ERβ knockout mouse model showed that ERα and ERβ have opposing actions in myocytes and that the balance between ERβ and ERα signaling is the prime regulator of the sex-specific sensitivity toward <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response of female myocytes to E(2) and BPA is dominated by the stimulatory ERβ-mediated signaling, and the absence of BPA and E(2) responsiveness in males is due to a counterbalancing-suppressive action of ERα </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the sex-specific sensitivity of myocytes to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> and the rapid arrhythmogenic effects of BPA and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> in the female heart are regulated by the balance between ERα and ER�� signaling </plain></SENT>
