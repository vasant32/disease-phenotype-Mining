<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> can present with similar features, including abnormal limb movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is reported that somewhere between 13 and 42% of patients with '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>' may be misdiagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A UK Parliamentary working group found that at least 74 000 English patients are misdiagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The likely alternative diagnosis is '<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp>' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, mimicking an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that many patients misdiagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> have <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and that prolonged electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring with an implantable ECG recorder (ILR) would show reflex cardioinhibition during T-LOC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This would respond to permanent pacing and allow <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs to be withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to evaluate tilt testing and other tests done in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We included patients previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, but considered to have a definite or likely misdiagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> after specialist neurological review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received an ILR (Reveal Plus(®)/Reveal DX(®), Medtronic Inc.), and tilt-table testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred and three patients were included, mean age of 46 ± 17 years, with 58 of 103 (56%) female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was previously made by a neurologist in 69%, but definite tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were only noted in the history in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 22 patients (21%), the ILR recorded profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> features, and they were offered pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After pacing and withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs, 60% of these patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only 14% of patients had a positive tilt-table test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In these, there was no correlation with the ECG findings of a spontaneous blackout during ILR recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows a high incidence of the cardioinhibition of reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> T-LOC previously diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We believe that reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> features mimics <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">generalized epilepsy</z:e>, leading to a misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This may be a widespread problem accounting for many wrong diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There was also poor correlation in ECG findings between tilt testing and ILR recording </plain></SENT>
