<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here five cases of sinus bigeminy in which comparatively long PP intervals alternated with comparatively short PP intervals, suggesting 'sinus escape-capture bigeminy' or 'sinus extrasystolic bigeminy' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In three of the cases, these two forms of sinus bigeminy were found in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first study on 'sinus escape-capture bigeminy' alternating with 'sinus extrasystolic bigeminy' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiographic findings in these cases suggest the possibility that 'sinus escape' in the sinoatrial junction is not true escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attempts are made to explain that apparent sinoatrial junctional escape occurs as a result of markedly slow conduction through the slow sinoatrial pathway, using the concepts of 'dual sinoatrial pathways' and 'double atrial response' </plain></SENT>
