<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data suggest increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> during and immediately after hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microvolt T-wave alternans (mTWA) is an electrocardiogram (ECG) measure of abnormal ventricular repolarization, which can be used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether mTWA measurements during dialysis indicate abnormal repolarization as a potential trigger to dialysis associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight-hour, 12-lead Holter ECG recordings were taken on a cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Modified moving average mTWA was examined for 48 hours from the start of dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predialysis biochemistry was taken and echocardiography was performed on a nondialysis day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen patients were analyzed (age 61 ± 14 years, time on dialysis 2.7 ± 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>mTWA increased during dialysis (P &lt; 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 hours postdialysis (first hour mTWA = 10.1 ± 4.5μV, final hour mTWA = 12.2 ± 3.7μV, postdialysis mTWA = 10.3 ± 2.7μV, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The change in mTWA did not correlate with serum biochemistry or echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular mass and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Peak mTWA and frequency of spikes in mTWA ≥ 65μV were not more common during dialysis compared to other times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed greater frequency of spikes ≥65μV or increase in hourly mean mTWA during dialysis did not have a worse cardiovascular outcome over a mean follow-up of 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Though there were subtle changes in mTWA during dialysis, there was no association with mTWA abnormalities previously shown to be associated with worse outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of abnormal mTWA did not correlate with outcome </plain></SENT>
