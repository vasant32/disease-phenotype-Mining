<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> induces ischaemic microcirculatory flow abnormalities in the ventricle, contributing to the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> on ventricular perfusion during rapid atrial pacing (RAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Coronary and fractional flow reserve (CFR/FFR) were measured in the left anterior descending artery in 29 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six received RAP, six received RAP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> (RAP/D), seven received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> alone, four received RAP with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (RAP/A), and six received neither (sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ventricular tissue, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-related gene and protein expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting; Isoprostanes were measured by GC-MS procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: CFR was decreased in the RAP group, compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FFR was not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effective refractory period was reduced in RAP compared with RAP/D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RAP-activated PKC phosphorylation tended to be decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> (P= 0.055) RAP induced NOX-1 and NOX-2 protein and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> reduced the pacing-dependent increase in the expression of NOX-2 protein and of HIF-1α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> marker, F(2)-isoprostane, was increased by RAP and this increase was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-related genes were induced by RAP compared with sham and were decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In HL1 cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the increased phosphorylation of PKCα after <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, with an almost significant effect (P= 0.059) on that after RAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> abolished RAP-induced ventricular microcirculatory abnormalities by decreasing <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-related gene and protein expression in the ventricle </plain></SENT>
