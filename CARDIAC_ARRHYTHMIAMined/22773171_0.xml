<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LVNC can be associated with other congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, but it can occur in isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of the disease are variable, ranging from no symptoms to signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, systemic emboli, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is established by two dimensional echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 44-year-old man with LVNC and discuss the role of multimodal imaging in the diagnosis and assessment of the disease </plain></SENT>
