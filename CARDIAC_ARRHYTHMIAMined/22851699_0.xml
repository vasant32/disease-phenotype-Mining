<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FHL2 (four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2) is expressed predominantly in the heart, and inactivation of the gene coding for FHL2 leads to exaggerated responsiveness to adrenergic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of calcineurin occurs downstream of β-adrenergic signaling and is required for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these facts, we hypothesized that FHL2 suppresses stress-induced activation of calcineurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FHL2 is upregulated in mouse hearts exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, a β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-induced increases in the NFAT target genes RCAN1.4 and BNP were amplified significantly in FHL2 knockout (FHL2(-/-)) mice compared with levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the effect of FHL2 on NFAT target gene transcript levels occurred at the level of transcription, HEK 293 cells and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct harboring the NFAT-dependent promoters of either RCAN1 or interleukin 2 (IL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the in vivo data, small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) knockdown of FHL2 led to increased activation of these promoters by constitutively active calcineurin or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi> ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, activation of the RCAN1 promoter by ionomycin, in control and FHL2 knockdown cells, was abolished by the calcineurin inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, confirming the calcineurin dependence of the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of FHL2 inhibited activation of both NFAT reporter constructs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NRVMs overexpressing FHL2 exhibited reduced hypertrophic growth in response to constitutively active calcineurin, as measured by cell cross-sectional area and fetal gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, immunostaining in isolated adult cardiomyocytes revealed colocalization of FHL2 and calcineurin predominantly at the sarcomere and activation of calcineurin by endothelin-1-facilitated interaction between FHL2 and calcineurin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FHL2 is an endogenous, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>-dependent suppressor of calcineurin </plain></SENT>
