<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the procedure is not risk free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research was to describe our experience with EMB during the last 33 years comparing surgical risk between HT versus no-HT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We analyzed retrospectively the data of 5347 EMBs performed from 1978 to 2011 (33 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For surveillance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episodes after HT we performed 3564 (66.7%), whereas 1777 (33.2%) for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> diagnosis, and 6 (1.0%) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumor</z:e> identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main complications due to EMB were divided into 2 groups to facilitate analysis: major complications associated with potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk, and minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variables that showed a significant difference in the HT group were as follows: tricuspid injury (.0490) and <z:mp ids='MP_0010476'>coronary fistula</z:mp> (.0000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the no-HT cohort they were insufficient fragment (.0000), major complications (.0000) and total complications (.0000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EMB can be accomplished with a low risk of complications and high effectiveness to diagnose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> and rejection after HT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the risk is great among patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> due to their anatomic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children also constitute a risk group for EMB due to their small size in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of injury to the tricuspid valve was higher among the HT group </plain></SENT>
