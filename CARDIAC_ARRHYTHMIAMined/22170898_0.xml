<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with high-grade AVB and QRS &lt;120 ms, who had temporary intrinsic atrioventricular (AV) conduction the day after the implantation were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a biventricular pacemaker with a para-His lead in the LV port, and a RVS lead in the right ventricular port </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular three-dimensional echocardiograms, LV outlet tract-velocity time integrals (LVOT-VTI), and LV synchrony with tissue Doppler imaging were recorded during AAI, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-PHP, and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-RVS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean LVOT-VTI was significant lower during <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-RVS (19.2 ± 5.5 cm) as compared with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-PHP (21.4 ± 5.5 cm), P = 0.006 and AAI (21.6 ± 6.8 cm), P = 0.016 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LVEF was higher during AAI than during <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-PHP (P= 0.02) and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-RVS (P&lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maximal time to peak velocity between basal segments was significant longer with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-RVS (95 ± 26 ms) than with AAI (72 ± 30 ms), P = 0.028, whereas no difference was observed between AAI and <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-PHP (81 ± 42 ms), P = 0.20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acutely, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-PHP preserves LV systolic performance and mechanical synchrony as compared with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>-RVS </plain></SENT>
