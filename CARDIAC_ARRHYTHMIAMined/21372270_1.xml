<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Guidelines have become very important in assisting with decision making in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have analyzed the level of evidence (LOE) underlying guidelines critically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the accuracy of the referenced literature that has led to recommendations with a level of evidence A (LOE-A) rating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The latest updates of the practice guidelines related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> posted on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) web site were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The referenced literature for LOE-A recommendation was analyzed to reassess the proposed grading scheme for LOE-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the clearly defined positive (Class I) and negative (Class III) recommendations with correctly referenced LOE-A were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A median of 5.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recommendations per guideline (interquartile range 4.9% to 9.7%) were categorized as LOE-A, but only 3.7% (IQR 3.4% to 4.9%) were accurately referenced as LOE-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 27 of 698 recommendations (median 1.2% per guideline [IQR 0.95% to 3.7%]) were correctly referenced as Class I or III LOE-A recommendations implying definite evidence-based positive or negative conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise the question of the accuracy of LOE-A in medical guidelines in general and highlight the importance of a critical use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they underline the need for improving the guideline-writing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further randomized double-blinded and/or crossover-designed studies should focus on areas with a gap in the evidence, such as existing but not yet convincing (LOE-B) or conflicting (Class II) evidence </plain></SENT>
