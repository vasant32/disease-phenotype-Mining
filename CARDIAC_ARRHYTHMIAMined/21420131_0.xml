<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 402 unselected patients were followed prospectively in a second-level country hospital, between November 2003 and November 2008 with a protocol based on European Guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 83.3% of patients and 26.6% required hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For every 100 cases, the number of tests carried out and their performance (percentage of positive diagnostic tests/number of tests carried out) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tilt test: 31 and performance: 62.4%, Doppler-echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>17-8.3%, Holter 16-13.2%, cranial CT 5.2-0%, ergometry 1.9-0%, chest CT 1.4-16%, EPS 1.2-33%, ILR 0.7-33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high percentage of diagnoses with low number of tests carried out, emphasizing the performance of tilt test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study of unselected patients with a protocol based on European Guidelines for the management and diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> applied by a multidisciplinary team was very effective </plain></SENT>
