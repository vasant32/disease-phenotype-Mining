<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Minimally invasive surgical ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has shown good results and low complications incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of this technique in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The procedure included pulmonary vein isolation, ganglionic plexi ablation, ligament of Marshall resection, and left atrial appendage exclusion through beating heart minimally invasive bilateral thoracotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were monitored daily by telemedicine during the first 4 months and then by quarterly 24-h Holter monitoring or by implantable cardiac monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ablation success was defined as freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence lasting more than 30 s and from antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for a minimum of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with AF, paroxysmal in 27% and persistent in 73%, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 63 ± 10 years, 86% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of patients had previously undergone to one or more catheter ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up period was 22 months (25°-75° percentile, 20-27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients free from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence for at least 6 consecutive months discontinued antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation was successful in 73% of patients at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Freedom from AF recurrences independently from antiarrhythmic therapy status was 91% at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results were consistent in patients that reached 24 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complications were: one conversion to sternotomy owing to thoracic adherences, one pacemaker implant, and one postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012151'>hemothorax</z:hpo> requiring surgical revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that minimally invasive surgical ablation was feasible and gave satisfactory results at long-term term follow-up in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
