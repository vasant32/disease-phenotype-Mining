<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial and short-term results of a new apical access and closure device to facilitate and standardize the transapical (TA) approach to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The apical access, stabilization and closure (ASC™) device consists of three components: an introducer system, a left ventricular low-profile <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> coil and a closure cap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ASC™ introducer system is anchored and rotated into the myocardium almost like a corkscrew, using the <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the TA-AVI procedure, the closure cap is introduced and delivered through the system into the <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> coil for final sealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11 high-risk elderly patients (EuroSCORE I: 27.8 ± 16.7; EuroSCORE II: 6.6 ± 5.0 and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score: 5.9 ± 2.7%) were evaluated for TA-AVI by our interdisciplinary Heart Team and subsequently included in the trial after informed consent was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient was excluded due to the presence of deep epicardial fat tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cases, the <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> coil provided sufficient sealing throughout the procedure without the presence of perisheath <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After delivery of the closure cap, no relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was observed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pericardial drainages were removed early in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered from non-device-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> requiring surgical decompression on postoperative day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered from delayed minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, most likely due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received aspirin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Discharge echocardiography revealed no changes in left ventricular function when compared with baseline and no new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> wall motion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients were alive at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TA access and closure are both feasible and safe using the APICA ASC™ device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The system facilitates and standardizes TA access and closure by providing a sufficient and secure sealing during and after the TA-AVI procedure </plain></SENT>
