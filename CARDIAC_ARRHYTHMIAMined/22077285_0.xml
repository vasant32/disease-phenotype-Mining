<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A filtered bipolar electrogram (EG) amplitude &lt;1.5 mV is a robust indicator of relatively dense scar, but is influenced by the wavefront direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unipolar recordings are not subject to directional influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that high-pass filtered unipolar EGs would provide similar information to bipolar EGs, without potential errors related to wavefront direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Simultaneous bipolar filtered at 30-500 Hz and unipolar (high-pass filtered at 30 Hz) signals were recorded during ventricular voltage maps in 24 patients (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five subsequent patients, low voltage surface areas were compared in electroanatomic maps (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,789 mapping points in group A, filtered unipolar EG amplitude correlated well with bipolar EG amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agreement of filtered unipolar recordings in classifying sites as &gt;1.5 mV or &lt;1.5 mV with bipolar EG amplitude was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discordance was due to unipolar &gt; bipolar amplitude at 83% of the discordant sites, consistent with possible reduction of bipolar amplitude due to direction dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Discordance was more frequent during epicardial than endocardial mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Double potentials were more frequently observed in bipolar than in unipolar recordings (3.2% vs 1.8%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group B, the mean low-voltage surface area (&lt;1.5 mV) was 70.1 ± 48.9 cm(2) for bipolar and 61.3 ± 52.2 cm(2) for filtered unipolar EG maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Direction dependent effects on bipolar EG amplitude may influence the identification of substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High-pass filtered unipolar EGs might be a reasonable alternative to bipolar recordings for creation of voltage maps </plain></SENT>
