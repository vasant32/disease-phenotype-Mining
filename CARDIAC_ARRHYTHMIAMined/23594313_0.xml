<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The annual volume of implants may condition and determine many aspects of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After the Spanish centers performing CRT were identified, data were recorded voluntarily by each implantation team from September 2010 to September 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: A total of 88 implanter centers were identified, and of these 85 (96.5%) answered the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 2,147 device implantations were reported, comprising 85% of the Eucomed's overall estimate for the same period, which was 2,518 implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Centers handling a higher volume of implants have a higher percentage of patients referred from other centers and more indications in patients over 80 years of age, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and unspecific disorders of intraventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These high-volume centers stimulate more frequently in patients with very wide QRS &gt; 200 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lower-volume centers select more classic patients for resynchronization, whereas higher-volume centers increase the rate of patients with AF and prior cardiac stimulation (upgrade) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Implant duration is shorter for higher-volume centers, which also perform implants in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, there are no significant differences in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, device type (pacemaker or defibrillator), implant techniques, achieved optimal site location, or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-volume centers perform CRT more frequently in elderly patients, mostly with AF and other alternative implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the complications reported by high-volume centers and those reported by low-volume centers </plain></SENT>
