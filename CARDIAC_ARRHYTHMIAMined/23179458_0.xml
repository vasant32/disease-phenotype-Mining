<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is the primary extrinsic control of cardiac performance, and altered autonomic activity has been recognized as an important factor in the progression of various cardiac pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular imaging techniques have been developed for global and regional interrogation of pre- and postsynaptic targets of the cardiac autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Building on established work with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5557">guanethidine</z:chebi> analogue ¹²³I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) for single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPECT), development of radiotracers and protocols for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) investigation of autonomic signaling has expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET is limited in availability and requires specialized centers for radiosynthesis and interpretation, but the higher resolution allows for improved regional analysis and kinetic modeling provides more true quantification than is possible with SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A wider array of radiolabeled <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, analogues of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, and receptor ligands have been characterized and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic neuronal PET tracers have shown promise in the identification of several cardiac pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, recent studies have elucidated a mechanistic role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> sympathetic innervation in the development of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of cardiomyocyte adrenergic receptor expression and the parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system has been slower to develop, with clinical studies beginning to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes the clinical and the experimental PET tracers currently available for autonomic imaging and discusses their application in health and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, with particular emphasis on the major findings of the last decade </plain></SENT>
