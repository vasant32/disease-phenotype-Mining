<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current myocardial perfusion MRI acquisitions are performed with a saturation recovery sequence, in large part to minimize sensitivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new approach is proposed here where the images are acquired ungated at steady state without use of a saturation pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data are acquired continuously and reach steady state after the first few images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A confluence of advances has made this new paradigm of an ungated steady-state acquisition possible-very rapid undersampled readouts with new reconstruction technologies permit enough measurements that continuous acquisition becomes a feasible approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gating can be applied retrospectively from a logged electrocardiogram (ECG) or with self-gating methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, simulations and measurements in a concentration phantom are used to demonstrate that similar contrast and signal can be obtained with the standard saturation recovery and the proposed spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, for a flip angle of 14Â° and a saturation recovery time of 80 ms, similar signals are acquired over a range of T(1) s that reflect realistic myocardial tissue concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results in one subject are presented to show the potential of this new approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The method may allow for cine cardiac perfusion and more signal-to-noise ratio-efficient acquisitions </plain></SENT>
