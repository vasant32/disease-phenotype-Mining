<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, complications such as ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are more frequent and more severe compared with ablation procedures for other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Irrigated-tip catheters have been reported to reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">asymptomatic cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) after AF ablation using an irrigated-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 70 consecutive AF patients who underwent catheter ablation were subjected to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 day after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 (14.3%) of 70 patients, MRI revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CI, but neither symptoms nor abnormal neurological findings were present in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, a history of persistent AF, left atrial dimension, presence of spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), procedure duration prior to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection, and electrical cardioversion during the procedure differed significantly between the two groups, those with and without CI (P = 0.02, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified SEC [odds ratio (OR), 9.39; 1.60-55.2; P = 0.01] and procedure duration prior to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection (OR, 1.19; 1.04-1.36; P = 0.01) as predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> asymptomatic CI after AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of SEC and procedure duration prior to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> injection are determinants of asymptomatic CI during AF ablation despite the use of an irrigated-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
