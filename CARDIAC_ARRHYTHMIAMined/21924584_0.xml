<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that nicorandil can reduce coronary events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether oral nicorandil treatment may reduce mortality following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the impact of oral nicorandil treatment on cardiovascular events in 1846 AMI patients who were hospitalized within 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, treated with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and discharged alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those with (Group N, n=535) and without (Group C, n=1311) oral nicorandil treatment at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in age, gender, body mass index, prevalence of coronary risk factors, or history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> existed between the two groups; however, higher incidences of multi-vessel disease, and a lower rate of successful PCI were observed in Group N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up of 709 (340-1088) days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality rate was 43% lower in Group N compared with Group C (2.4% vs. 4.2%, stratified log-rank test: p=0.0358) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that nicorandil treatment was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after discharge (Hazard ratio 0.495, 95% CI: 0.254-0.966, p=0.0393), but not for other cardiovascular events such as re-infarction, admission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that oral administration of nicorandil is associated with reduced incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the setting of secondary prevention after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
