<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, we have used the whole cell patch clamp technique to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> on the major cardiac ion channels expressed in HEK293 cells and the native voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in rat ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the results, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> is a potent blocker of cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels, such as hERG, I(Ks) and I(K1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rank order of inhibitory potency was hERG &gt;I(K1)&gt; I(Ks) with IC(50) values of 0.7, 10.5, and 15.2 µM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> also inhibited I(Na) and I(Ca), and the IC(50) values are 6.1 and 2.6 µM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modification of these ion channels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> could induce changes of the cardiac action potential duration and QT interval, and might result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
