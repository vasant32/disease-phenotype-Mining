<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for this effect of n-3 LCPUFAs is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies and clinical trials published in the 1980s and 1990s suggested that n-3 LCPUFAs may be antiarrhythmic drugs, but more recent trials have not confirmed this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we examine evidence for, and against, the direct antiarrhythmic action of n-3 LCPUFAs and suggest that antistructural remodeling effects of n-3 LCPUFAs may be more relevant in accounting for their clinical effects </plain></SENT>
