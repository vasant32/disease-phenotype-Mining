<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that rhythm control after interventional AF treatment is more successful using a steerable as compared with a nonsteerable sheath access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory AF undergoing their first ablation procedure were prospectively included in a randomized fashion in 2 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed by 10 operators with different levels of clinical experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcome was measured with serial 7-day Holter ECGs and additional symptom-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single procedure success (freedom from AF and/or atrial macroreentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) was significantly higher in patients ablated with a steerable sheath (78% versus 55% after 3 months, P=0.005; 76% versus 53% after 6 months, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rate of pulmonary vein isolation, procedure duration, and radiofrequency application time did not differ significantly, whereas fluoroscopy time was lower in the steerable sheath group (33±14 minutes versus 45±17 minutes, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complication rates showed no significant difference (3.2% versus 5%, P=0.608) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariable analysis, steerable sheath usage remained the only powerful predictor for rhythm outcome after 6 months of follow-up (hazard ratio, 2.837 [1.197 to 6.723]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AF catheter ablation using a manually controlled, steerable sheath for catheter navigation resulted in a significantly higher clinical success rate, with comparable complication rates and with a reduction in periprocedural fluoroscopy time </plain></SENT>
