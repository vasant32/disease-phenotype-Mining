<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum BNP concentration was measured by electrochemiluminescence assay in 62 consecutive children and adolescents hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 62 children and adolescents hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, 39 had noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, of whom 37 (59.7%) had autonomic-mediated reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and two (3.2%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (37.1%) had cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>: 11 of these had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and 12 had structural cardiac/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> had significantly higher serum BNP than those with non-cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (958.78 ± 2443.41 pg/mL vs 31.05 ± 22.64 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic multivariate regression analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> during syncopal episodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> and increased serum BNP levels were independent predictors of cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a cut-off value of 40.65 pg/mL, serum BNP was associated with significant risk of a cardiac cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, with sensitivity of 73.9% and specificity of 70.0% for distinguishing cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> from noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum BNP was helpful in differentiating cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> from noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
