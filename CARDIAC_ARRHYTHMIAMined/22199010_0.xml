<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>Right ventricular failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RVF</z:e>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) is associated with increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> by a poorly explored mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We test the hypothesis that PH promotes spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) during a critical post-PH <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> period characterized by a sudden increase in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats received either a single subcutaneous dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6980">monocrotaline</z:chebi> (MCT, 60 mg/kg) to induce PH-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RVF</z:e> (PH, n=24) or saline (control, n=17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation pattern of the RV-epicardial surface was mapped using voltage-sensitive dye in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts along with single glass-microelectrode and ECG-recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MCT-injected rats developed severe PH by day 21 and progressed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RVF</z:e> by approximately day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats manifested increased mortality, and ≈30% rats died suddenly and precipitously during 23-32 days after MCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This fatal period was associated with the initiation of spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> by a focal mechanism in the RV, which was subsequently maintained by both focal and incomplete reentrant wave fronts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microelectrode recordings from the RV-epicardium at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of focal activity showed early afterdepolarization-mediated triggered activity that led to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the RV cellular triggered beats preceded left ventricular depolarizations by 23±8 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RV but not the left ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated during this fatal period manifested significant action potential duration prolongation, dispersion, and an increased susceptibility to depolarization-induced repetitive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was observed in any of the control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RVF</z:e> was associated with significantly reduced RV ejection fraction (P&lt;0.001), RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (P&lt;0.001), and RV <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic function of the LV and its structure were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PH-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RVF</z:e> is associated with a distinct phase of increased mortality characterized by spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> arising from the RV by an early afterdepolarization-mediated triggered activity </plain></SENT>
