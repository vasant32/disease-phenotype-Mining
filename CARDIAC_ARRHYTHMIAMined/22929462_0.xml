<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relation between the progression of CAN in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and ventricular repolarization remains to be fully described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study examined QT interval variability and heart rate interbeat variability to identify any alterations of cardiac repolarization in diabetic patients in relation to severity of CAN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy control participants without (CAN-) and 74 patients with CAN (CAN+) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 74 CAN + patients, 62 are early CAN + (eCAN +) , and 12 are definite CAN + (dCAN +) according to autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system function tests as described by Ewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the QT variability index (QTVI) was significantly higher and positive in the dCAN + (0.51 ±1.32) group than in the eCAN + (-0.39 ±0.91) and CAN - (-0.54 ±0.72) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QT variability to heart-rate variability ratio provides a measure of the balance between QT and heart interbeat variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QTVI was more sensitive in identifying disease progression at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study supports the hypothesis that QTVI could be used as a clinical test to identify early CAN and as a marker of CAN progression in diabetic patients and may help physicians in determining the best therapeutic strategy for these patients </plain></SENT>
