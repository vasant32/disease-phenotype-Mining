<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a minimally invasive technique may lead to fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight male rhesus macaques 10-15 kg and 10-15 years old were sedated with ketamine (2 mg/kg), midazolam (1.3 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (0.01 mg/kg) and buprenorphine 0.02 mg/kg intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Etomidate 1-2 mg/kg was injected intravenously to allow tracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia was maintained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), inspired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> fractions (F(I)ISO) and core temperature were recorded every 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced by a balloon-tipped catheter advanced via the femoral artery into the left anterior descending artery and inflated to completely occlude the vessel for 20-50 min (IT) before reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequences of elevated ST segment, QRS complex prolongation, ventricular premature complexes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> were observed with a lower incidence than previously described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IT was (min: 17; max: 50) min long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>F(I)ISO was lower than the minimal alveolar concentration in these species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP &lt; 70 mmHg) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (T°C &lt; 36°C) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> macaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This minimally invasive closed chest model was successful in providing better cardiorespiratory physiological parameters than reported in previous models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The benefit (achieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>) versus risk (lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) of the duration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> should be considered </plain></SENT>
