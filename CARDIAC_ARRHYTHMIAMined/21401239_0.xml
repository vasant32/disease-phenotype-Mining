<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the extent to which tonic respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA)-a putative marker of regulatory capacity-moderated the association between stress-related changes in RSA (i.e., phasic RSA) and concurrent changes in affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight healthy, young adults completed ratings of affect during a resting baseline and following the recall of a recent stressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tonic RSA moderated the association of phasic RSA with stress-related change in positive affect (PA), such that change in RSA had a positive association with PA for individuals with higher tonic RSA and a negative association for those with lower tonic RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of specific aspects of PA indicated that phasic RSA was positively associated with changes in ratings of attentive engagement among individuals with higher tonic RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings inform our understanding of phasic RSA and support the notion that flexible parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system functioning is an important component of adaptive stress regulation </plain></SENT>
