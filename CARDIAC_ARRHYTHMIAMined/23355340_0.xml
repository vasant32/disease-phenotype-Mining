<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that transplantation of autologously derived mitochondria immediately prior to reperfusion would ameliorate these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>New Zealand White rabbits were used for regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (RI), which was achieved by temporarily snaring the left anterior descending artery for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following 29 min of RI, autologously derived mitochondria (RI-mitochondria; 9.7 ± 1.7 × 10(6)/ml) or vehicle alone (RI-vehicle) were injected directly into the RI zone, and the hearts were allowed to recover for 4 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> transplantation decreased (P &lt; 0.05) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase MB, cardiac troponin-I, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> significantly in the RI zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size following 4 wk of recovery was decreased significantly in RI-mitochondria (7.9 ± 2.9%) compared with RI-vehicle (34.2 ± 3.3%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiograms showed that RI-mitochondria hearts returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> contraction within 10 min after reperfusion was started; however, RI-vehicle hearts showed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002375'>hypokinesia</z:hpo> in the RI zone at 4 wk of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram and optical mapping studies showed that no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was associated with autologously derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo and in vitro studies show that the transplanted mitochondria are evident in the interstitial spaces and are internalized by cardiomyocytes 2-8 h after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The transplanted mitochondria enhanced oxygen consumption, high-energy phosphate synthesis, and the induction of cytokine mediators and proteomic pathways that are important in preserving myocardial energetics, cell viability, and enhanced post-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> cardiac function </plain></SENT>
