<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rabbits with left anterior descending artery ligation were prepared and allowed to recover for 8 weeks, as HMI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals undergoing an identical surgical procedure without coronary ligation were served as the sham-operated group (sham group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whole cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to measure and compare currents in cells from the different groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Noting that I(Ca,T) density in HMI cells increased markedly to -2.36 +/- 0.12 pA/pF (at -30 mV) compared with cells of sham, where little I(Ca,T) (-0.35 +/- 0.02 pA/pF) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, further analysis revealed a significant hyperpolarizing shift of steady-state activation curve of I(Ca,T) in HMI cells, where the time constants of deactivation were prolonged and the time of recovery from inactivation was shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the amplitude of I(Ca,T) was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">Carvedilol</z:chebi> (1 micromol x L(-1)) was found to decrease the amplitude of I(Ca,T) to -1.38 +/- 0.07 pA/pF through inhibiting process of I(Ca,T) activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> delayed recovery from inactivation of I(Ca,T) and shortened the time constants of deactivation in HMI cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggested that the application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> in HMI cells contributes to the dynamic changes in I(Ca,T) and may account for reduction of incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
