<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a common clinical problem; however, effective and applicable clinical prevention/treatment is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel effective treatment in attenuating OI in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study used a randomized, controlled, crossover design using two protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Orthostatic intolerance was induced with a combination of head-up tilt (HUT) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy individuals in Protocol 1 and 10 healthy individuals in Protocol 2 received no EA, EA at PC-6 acupuncture points (acupoint), and EA at a non-acupoint in a random order with an interim of 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture was administered prior to HUT/LBNP in Protocol 1 and simultaneously during HUT/LBNP in Protocol 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroacupuncture at PC-6 administered either before or during HUT/LBNP postponed the occurrence of pre-syncopal symptoms, improved haemodynamic responses to HUT/LBNP (including increased diastolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and total peripheral resistance and a <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp>), blunted decreases of maximum velocity and velocity time integral of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery, and increased plasma noradrenalin and adrenalin concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, heart rate variability analysis revealed that EA at PC-6 either before or during HUT/LBNP decreased high-frequency ranges of R-R interval while increasing low-frequency ranges of R-R interval, which indicates an elevated heart sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture at PC-6 is effective in improving orthostatic tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function improvement and sympathetic activation are responsible for the improved orthostatic tolerance after EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>EA represents a novel intervention against OI </plain></SENT>
