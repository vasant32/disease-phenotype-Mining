<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reduction of the transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (I(to)) in mammalian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> is consistent with a reduced expression of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel interacting protein 2 (KChIP2, a K(V)4 subunit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approaches have been made to investigate the role of KChIP2 in shaping cardiac I(to), including the use of transgenic KChIP2 deficient mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> overexpression of KChIP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interplay between I(to) and myocardial calcium handling is pivotal in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and is further strengthened by the dual role of KChIP2 as a functional subunit on both K(V)4 and Ca(V)1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the potential arrhythmogenic consequence of reduced I(to) may contribute to the high relative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in the early phases of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With this review, we offer an overview of the insights into the physiological and pathological roles of KChIP2 and we discuss the limitations of translating the molecular basis of electrophysiological remodeling from animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> to the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
