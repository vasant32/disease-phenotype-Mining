<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a few recent studies, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> based on reentry and circus movement of the slow wave have been shown to occur in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased stomachs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, reentry has not been demonstrated before in any other part of the gastrointestinal system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No animals had to be killed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Use was made of materials obtained during the course of another study in which 11 rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> and housed with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 and 7 mo, segments of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were isolated and positioned in a tissue bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slow wave propagation was recorded with 121 extracellular electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the experiment, the propagation of the slow waves was reconstructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 10 of a total of 66 intestinal segments (15%), a circus movement of the slow wave was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These reentries were seen in control (n = 2) as well as in 3-mo (n = 2) and 7-mo (n = 6) diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local conduction velocities and beat-to-beat intervals during the reentries were measured (0.42 ± 0.15 and 3.03 ± 0.67 cm/s, respectively) leading to a wavelength of 1.3 ± 0.5 cm and a circuit diameter of 4.1 ± 1.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first demonstration of a reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the small intestine of control and diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Calculations of the size of the circuits indicate that they are small enough to fit inside the intestinal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation based on measured velocities and rates indicate that reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are also possible in the distal small intestine of larger animals including humans </plain></SENT>
