<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have demonstrated that unstable repolarization dynamics is a risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have recently developed an algorithm to detect QT interval (QTI) instability from the clinical ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we developed a clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk stratification index based on the detection of QTI instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intracardiac electrocardiograms were recorded at rest in 114 patients with implanted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up until appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred, whichever came first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each recording was divided into 1-min episodes (minECGs); the instability in QTI dynamics, if any, of each minECG was detected with our algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk index termed QTI instability index (QTII) was defined as the number of minECGs with unstable QTI dynamics normalized by the number of minECGs with premature activations (PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The performance of QTII in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk stratification was examined with survival analysis, and was compared with other risk indices, such as mean RR interval (RRI), the standard deviation of RRI and QTI, and the frequency of PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the index QTII, which account for multiple risk factors and their interdependence, perform better than indices quantifying individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk factors in the stratification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results of survival analysis show that QTII outperformed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other studied indices in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk stratification and was the only independent indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> propensity in a multivariate survival model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QTII is a promising <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk stratification index </plain></SENT>
