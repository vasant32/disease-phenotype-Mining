<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the significance of induced AT and the impact of their ablation on the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 194 patients with LPAF (&gt;1 year) who underwent catheter ablation (pulmonary vein isolation with substrate ablation), an inducibility test was performed after AF termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AT was induced in 108 (56%) patients (induced AT group); neither AT nor AF was inducible in 37 (19%, noninduction group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During 39 ± 21 months, AT recurred in 30 patients (28%), AF in 19 (17%), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 56 (52%) among induced AT group, although there was a recurrence of AT in 9 (24%, P = 0.68), AF in 6 (16%, P = 0.85), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 22 (60%, P = 0.42) among noninduction group (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Note that 10 patients with repeated ablation in induced AT group revealed 8 different and 2 similar recurrent ATs compared to the induced ATs at first session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean cycle length of induced AT that terminated by ablation (271 ± 64 ms) was longer than that without (249 ± 58 ms, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In induced AT group, AT recurrence rate in patients who achieved AT termination by ablation was lower than those without termination (5% vs 36%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ATs that are inducible after LPAF termination do not necessarily become clinical AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients who achieved noninducibility of AT by ablating slower cycle length of AT had better outcomes </plain></SENT>
