<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the safety and outcomes of RFCA of AF in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2008 to 2011, out of 2,754 consecutive patients undergoing RFCA of AF, 103 (3.7%) had ≥80 years (age 85 ± 3 years, 4 with &gt;90 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) antrum isolation was performed in paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nonparoxysmal AF, ablation was extended to the entire left atrial posterior wall and to complex fractionated electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers were disclosed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> challenge at the end of the procedure and targeted for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Octogenarians presented a high rate of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers (84% vs 69%, P = 0.001), especially in patients with paroxysmal AF (62% vs 19%, P &lt; 0.001); non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers were most commonly mapped in the coronary sinus (54%), left atrial appendage (32%), interatrial septum and superior vena cava (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 18 ± 6 months, 71 (69%) octogenarians remained free from AF recurrence off antiarrhythmic drugs after a single procedure (vs 71% in patients &lt;80 years, P = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The success rate reached 87% after 2 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total periprocedural complication rates also did not differ between the 2 age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RFCA of AF is safe and effective in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high rate of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers is present in these patients, and targeting multiple structures other than the pulmonary veins is often necessary to achieve long-term success </plain></SENT>
