<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>How abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx through CaV1.2 underlies phenotypes such as the accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> or craniofacial abnormalities in the majority of affected individuals is not readily explained by established CaV1.2 roles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that CaV1.2 is expressed in the first and second pharyngeal arches within the subset of cells that give rise to jaw primordia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in mouse, in concert with knockdown/rescue and pharmacological approaches in zebrafish, demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> influx through CaV1.2 regulates jaw development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial neural crest migration was unaffected by CaV1.2 knockdown, suggesting a role for CaV1.2 later in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focusing on the mandible, we observed that <z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> depended upon <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> signals through CaV1.2, including those that activated the calcineurin signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these results provide new insights into the role of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels in nonexcitable cells during development </plain></SENT>
