<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic characteristics of a focal AT arising from the CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a consecutive series of 92 patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for focal AT, three (4.4%) patients (three men) with a focal AT arising from the CTI were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 71 years (range, 50 to 81 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had a history of CTI-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram (ECG) of a focal AT showed a significant negative F-wave in the inferior leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Focal AT could be reproducibly initiated and terminated with programmed stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The focus of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was localized to the central isthmus in two and the paraseptal isthmus in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle length was 275 ms (range, 260 to 310 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the focal AT was <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> insensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was entrained from multiple right atrial sites, including the earliest activation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RFCA was acutely successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients over the median follow-up of 18 months (range, 6 to 33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cavotricuspid isthmus is an uncommon site of origin for focal AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This focal AT has unique electrocardiographic characteristics such as saw-tooth <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> on ECG and is suggested to be caused by a focal reentrant circuit located at the CTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Long-term success is achieved with focal ablation </plain></SENT>
