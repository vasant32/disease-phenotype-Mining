<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Subclinical atrial stunning (AS) (left atrial dysfunction) may increase vulnerability to oxidative and inflammatory stressors, thus increasing the likelihood of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of mitral annular velocities by tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) may be useful in seeking subclinical AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study aimed to evaluate the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after bypass surgery and presurgical determination of subclinical AS by assessing mitral annular velocities by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery into this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were sinus rhythm and a negative history of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> during the previous 3 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An experienced cardiologist performed transthoracic echocardiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recorded standard two-dimensional, mitral inflow conventional Doppler interrogation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> pulsed wave data from the lateral and septal annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CABG surgery at our Cardiovascular Surgery Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative AF status: group 1 patients had postoperative AF and group 2 patients did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 44 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> were the only two significantly different parameters among clinical characteristics between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings that were statistically significantly different between groups were as follows: lateral A diastolic mitral annular velocity, group 1: 0.11 ± 0.19 ms(-1)versus group 2: 0.08 ± 0.19 ms(-1) (P = 0.001); lateral E diastolic mitral annular velocity, group 1: 0.69 ± 0.24 ms(-1)versus group 2: 0.62 ± 0.31 ms(-1) (P = 0.016); Septal E diastolic mitral annular velocity, group 1: 0.05 ± 0.01 ms(-1)versus group 2: 0.04 ± 0.01 ms(-1) (P = 0.033); septal A diastolic mitral annular velocity, group 1: 0.08 ± 0.02 ms(-1)versus group 2: 0.05 ± 0.02 ms(-1) (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is no relationship between AF after CABG surgery and preexisting subclinical AS determined with mitral annular velocities by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Preoperative appropriate prophylactic treatment should be administered to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
