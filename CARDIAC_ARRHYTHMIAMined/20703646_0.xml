<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classification of the ECG into different pathologic disease categories is a complex pattern recognition task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose a method for ECG heartbeat pattern recognition using wavelet neural network (WNN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To achieve this objective, an algorithm for QRS detection is first implemented, then a WNN Classifier is developed </plain></SENT>
