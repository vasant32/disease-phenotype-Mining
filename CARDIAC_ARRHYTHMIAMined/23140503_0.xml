<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim: To investigate the effect of surface charge of therapeutic nanoparticles on sarcolemmal ionic homeostasis and the initiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials &amp; methods: Cultured neonatal rat myocytes were exposed to 50 nm-charged <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> latex nanoparticles and examined using a combination of hopping probe scanning ion conductance microscopy, optical recording of action potential characteristics and patch clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: Positively charged, <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>-modified <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> latex nanoparticles showed cytotoxic effects and induced large-scale damage to cardiomyocyte membranes leading to calcium alternans and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, negatively charged, carboxyl-modified <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> latex nanoparticles (NegNPs) were not overtly cytotoxic but triggered formation of 50-250-nm nanopores in the membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells exposed to NegNPs revealed pro-arrhythmic events, such as delayed afterdepolarizations, reduction in conduction velocity and pathological increment of action potential duration together with an increase in ionic current throughout the membrane, carried by the nanopores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The utilization of charged nanoparticles is a novel concept for targeting cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this unique nanoscopic investigation reveals an altered electrophysiological substrate, which sensitized the heart cells towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
