<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study has examined whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> (PN), generated during the preconditioning (PC) procedure or administered by brief intracoronary infusions, plays a trigger role in the anti-arrhythmic effects of preconditioning and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in anaesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To achieve this we infused the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> scavenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> (UA; 0.2 mg/kg/min, i.v.) over a 30 min period, just prior to a 25 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, in preconditioned (UA+PC, n=8), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>-treated (UA+PN, n=8) and in control (UAC; n=9) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects were compared to those obtained from groups (PC, n=10; PN, n=10; C1, n=14) without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (ST-segment elevation, inhomogeneity of electrical activation) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>, VT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), plasma nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels, as well as myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and nitrotyrosine productions were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both preconditioning and the infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> increased nitrotyrosine formation which was abolished by the simultaneous administration of urate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the protective effects of preconditioning (i.e. reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and nitrotyrosine productions, as well as the increase in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> availability), occurring during the prolonged period of occlusion and reperfusion were still present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, urate completely abolished the protection resulted from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect is most probably due to the fact that urate has already scavenged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> during the infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, urate itself, given prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and reperfusion, was also protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in nanomolar concentrations can induce an anti-arrhythmic effect but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, generated during the preconditioning stimulus, is not necessary for the preconditioning-induced anti-arrhythmic protection </plain></SENT>
