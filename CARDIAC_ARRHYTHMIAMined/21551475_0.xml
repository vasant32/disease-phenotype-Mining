<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether rate responsive pacing with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) would acutely improve exercise performance in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and severe CI (&lt;70% age-predicted maximum heart rate) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 13) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, a CRT device, and severe CI were randomized in a double-blind crossover pilot study to either <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> (control) or DDDR (rate responsive) pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six minutes walk test (6MWT) distance, oxygen consumption at anaerobic threshold (VO(2) @ AT), and maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2) max) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week later, testing was repeated in the alternate pacing mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rate responsive pacing commenced with standard settings in only 9 of 13 (69%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these 9 subjects, 6MWT distance improved acutely from 358.5 ± 40.7 to 376.8 ± 24.5 m with DDDR pacing (P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VO(2) max did not improve with DDDR pacing (14.0 ± 3.2 mL/kg/min) compared with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacing (13.9 ± 3.0 mL/kg/min; P= 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VO(2) @ AT tended towards improvement with DDDR pacing (10.8 ± 2.9 mL/kg/min) compared with <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacing (9.6 ± 1.8 mL/kg/min; P= 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a linear relationship between the increase in heart rate at minute 3 during rate responsive pacing and improvement in VO(2) @ AT (r = 0.83, P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When rate responsive pacing using a CRT device is achieved in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and severe CI, parameters of aerobic exercise performance improve acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Routine exercise testing to ensure successful restoration of heart rate response may be beneficial to optimize CRT settings in this patient population </plain></SENT>
