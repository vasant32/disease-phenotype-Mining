<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> through permanent cardiac pacing in patients with bifascicular block (PRESS) is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blinded study designed to demonstrate a reduction in symptomatic events in patients with bifascicular block and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of undetermined origin implanted with permanent pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Device programming mode (NASPE/BPEG code) at <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> with a lower rate of 60 ppm is compared with backup pacing at DDI with a lower rate of 30 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The end point consisted of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, (2) symptomatic presyncopal episodes associated with a device intervention (ventricular pacing), and (3) symptomatic episodes associated with intermittent or permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (any degree) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred one patients were enrolled and randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end point events at 2 years were observed in 23 patients, with a significant lower incidence in the study group (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.96; P=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of any symptoms, associated or not with device intervention, was superior in DDD60 compared with DDI30 (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.78; P=0.0053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients developed other rhythm diseases and met class I indication for pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of rhythm disease development was 7.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with bifascicular block and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> of undetermined origin, the use of a dual chamber pacemaker programmed to DDD60 led to a significant reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or symptomatic events associated with a cardioinhibitory origin, compared with DDI30 programming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms associated with a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of rhythm disease were found in 15% of the population at 2 years </plain></SENT>
