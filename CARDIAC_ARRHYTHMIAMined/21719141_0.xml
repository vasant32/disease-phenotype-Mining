<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This equation governs the field of activation times in a domain where conduction properties are specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This approach has been applied to knowledge-based interpolation of sparse measurements of activation times and to the creation of initial conditions for detailed ionic models of cardiac propagation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the mathematical basis, matrix formulation, and compact Matlab implementation of an iterative finite-element solver (triangular meshes) for the eikonal-diffusion equation extended to reentrant activations, which automatically identifies the period of reentry and computes the resulting isochrones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An iterative algorithm is designed to perform Laplacian interpolation of reentrant activation maps to be used as initial estimate for the eikonal-diffusion solver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in test-case geometries (ventricular slice and simplified atrial surface model) </plain></SENT>
