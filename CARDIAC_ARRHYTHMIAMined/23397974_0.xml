<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: While most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) can be ablated successfully using an endocardial (endo) approach, epicardial (epi) mapping and ablation is sometimes required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There may be suggestive clues on the surface electrocardiogram; however, identification of an epi origin of VA with certainty remains problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients referred for ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or frequent ventricular ectopy from June 2007 to July 2011 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with completed endo and epi electroanatomical activation maps of an epi VA were included (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bipolar electrograms (EGMs) in the area of earliest endo activation were analyzed and compared to the area of early epi activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An EGM component was characterized as far field if it was monophasic and there was inability to capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified 3 characteristics from endo mapping that consistently indicated need for epi ablation: (1) Diffusely early activation (&gt;2 cm(2) region of sites with equally earliest activation within 10 milliseconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) Sequence of a far-field EGM followed by a near-field EGM in the region of earliest endo activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Inability to capture the far-field component of the earliest EGM (stim-QRS &lt; egm-QRS time) or reproduce morphological features of the VA complex with stimulation at the earliest endo site of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a diffusely early area of activation and inability to capture a far-field endo EGM indicates that epi ablation may be needed to eliminate a VA </plain></SENT>
