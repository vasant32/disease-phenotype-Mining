<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health resource consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, as many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF are asymptomatic, rapid, accurate opportunistic screening is needed in primary care to detect AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) technology is too clumsy and time consuming for mass opportunistic screening, thus technology that allows easy, rapid, yet accurate AF screening is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this requirement a prototype hand-held electrode assembly was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a 6-lead frontal-plane ECG acquired from this apparatus in a seated, clothed patient would be as accurate at detecting AF as conventional 12-lead ECG in the undressed, supine patient (the 'gold standard') </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrocardiograms were obtained from 78 patients with AF and 79 with sinus rhythm (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a conventional 12-lead ECG, a 6-lead ECG from conventionally positioned limb electrodes, a supine 6-lead recording using the prototype recorder placed on the lower thorax/upper abdomen, and a 6-lead prototype recording in the seated patient, the latter with loosened clothing only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were randomly and blindly assessed by two cardiologists for (i) diagnosis of AF vs. SR and (ii) tracing quality (subjectively assessed as good, adequate, or bad) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with conventional 12-lead ECG recordings, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 'new' recording methods performed satisfactorily with sensitivities ≥90% (90-99%), specificities ≥94% (94-100%), positive predictive values ≥94% (94-100%), negative predictive values ≥90% (90-99%), and accuracies ≥93% (93-99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tracing quality was higher in conventional 12-lead recordings (71 and 80% were assessed as good by the two observers) compared with conventional 6-lead (57 and 59%), supine prototype (41 and 31%), and sitting prototype (39 and 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite inferior electrocardiographic quality a 6-lead frontal plane ECG acquired by a simple prototype hand-held electrode assembly allowed reliable differentiation of AF from SR compared with standard 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
