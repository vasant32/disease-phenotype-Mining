<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to determine the effects of the κ-OR on stretch-induced electrophysiological changes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham operated, MI, U-50488H (a selective κ-OR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>) -treated MI (MI+U-50488H) and nor-BNI (a selective κ-OR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) -treated MI (MI+nor-BNI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After Langendorff perfusion to maintain stabilization, a transient stretch (5 seconds) was delivered early in diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological changes were recorded for 1 minute before and after stretch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the 20%, 50% and 90% monophasic action potential duration (MAPD20, MAPD50 and MAPD90, respectively) and stretch-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MAPD90 significantly increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAPD90 in the MI and MI+nor-BNI groups increased significantly before stretch (P &lt; 0.05) and after stretch (P &lt; 0.01) but was reversed in the MI+U-50488H group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAPD90 in the MI group was increased compared with that of the MI+U-50488H group but decreased compared with that of the MI+ nor-BNI group after stretch (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score in the MI and MI+nor-BNI groups was higher than that of the sham-operated group (P &lt; 0.01), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score in the MI+nor-BNI group was higher than that in MI group after stretch (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score of the MI+U-50488H group was lower than that of MI group after stretch (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The κ-OR could influence the stretch-induced electrophysiological changes and play an antiarrhythmic role in stretch-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI </plain></SENT>
