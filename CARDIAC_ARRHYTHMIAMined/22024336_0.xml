<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenic effect (cardiac toxicity) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> in isolated rat hearts and ventricular myocytes and HEK 293 cells stably expressing human Nav1.5, HCN2, or hERG channel using conventional electrophysiological approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> (5mM) induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and atrial-ventricular conduction blockade or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and inhibited cardiac contractile function in isolated rat hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It shortened action potential duration (APD) in isolated rat ventricular myocytes, and increased the threshold current for triggering action potential, but had no effect on the inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current I(K1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> significantly inhibited the L-type calcium current I(Ca.L) and the transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current I(to) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)s: 1.01 and 2.4mM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In HEK 293 cells stably expressing cardiac ion channel genes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> reduced hNav1.5, HCN2, and hERG currents with IC(50)s of 8.2, 3.3, and 4.0mM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate for the first time that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and the arrhythmogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35255">trichloromethane</z:chebi> is related to the inhibition of multiple ionic currents including I(Ca.L), I(to), I(Na), HCN2, and hERG channels </plain></SENT>
