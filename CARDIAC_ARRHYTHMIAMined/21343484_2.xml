<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Irreversible electroporation is a nonthermal ablative tool that uses direct electrical pulses to create irreversible membrane pores and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ablation zone is surrounded by a zone of reversibly increased permeability; either zone can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to establish a safety profile for the use of irreversible electroporation close to the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS And METHODS: The effect of unsynchronized and synchronized (with the R wave on ECG) irreversible electroporation in swine lung and myocardium was studied in 11 pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve lead ECG recordings were analyzed by an electrophysiologist for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were categorized as major events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other dysrhythmias or ECG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and lung tissue was submitted for histopathologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrical field modeling was performed to predict the distance from the applicators over which cells show electroporation-induced increased permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At less than or equal to 1.7 cm from the heart, fatal (major) events occurred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unsynchronized irreversible electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No major and three minor events were seen with synchronized irreversible electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At more than 1.7 cm from the heart, two minor events occurred with only unsynchronized irreversible electroporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electrical field modeling correlates well with the clinical results, revealing increased cell membrane permeability up to 1.7 cm away from the applicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete lung ablation without intervening live cells was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No myocardial injury was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unsynchronized irreversible electroporation close to the heart can cause fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Synchronizing irreversible electroporation pulse delivery with absolute refractory period avoids significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
