<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, affecting &gt;2 million patients in the United States alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite decades of research, surprisingly little is known regarding the molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ANK2 encodes ankyrin-B, a multifunctional adapter molecule implicated in membrane targeting of ion channels, transporters, and signaling molecules in excitable cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, we report early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF in patients harboring loss-of-function mutations in ANK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In mice, we show that ankyrin-B deficiency results in atrial electrophysiological dysfunction and increased susceptibility to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ankyrin-B(+/-) atrial myocytes display shortened action potentials, consistent with human AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B is expressed in atrial myocytes, and we demonstrate its requirement for the membrane targeting and function of a subgroup of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (Ca(v)1.3) responsible for low voltage-activated L-type Ca(2+) current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ankyrin-B is associated directly with Ca(v)1.3, and this interaction is regulated by a short, highly conserved motif specific to Ca(v)1.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, loss of ankyrin-B in atrial myocytes results in decreased Ca(v)1.3 expression, membrane localization, and function sufficient to produce shortened atrial action potentials and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate reduced ankyrin-B expression in atrial samples of patients with documented AF, further supporting an association between ankyrin-B and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that reduced ankyrin-B expression or mutations in ANK2 are associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our data demonstrate a novel pathway for ankyrin-B-dependent regulation of Ca(v)1.3 channel membrane targeting and regulation in atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
