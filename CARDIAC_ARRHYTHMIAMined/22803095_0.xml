<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of heart activity and its relationship with respiratory and motor activities were studied in rat fetuses with preserved placental circulation on gestation days 15-20 (E15-20) and in newborn rats (P0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the studied period, the heart rate in fetuses increased from 175.93±6.10 bpm (E15) to 271.82±5.93 bpm (E20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After birth, the heart rate decreased to 220.94±8.73 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability in the decasecond and near-minute ranges was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At E16 stage it is presented by slow regular oscillations lasting for 20-35 sec with an amplitude of 10-45 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison of functional activities of the cardiac and somatic motor systems showed that at E16, fluctuations in heart rate are independent of the bouts of motor excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During growing, the degree of synchronization of heart rate variability with physical activity increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>E17-18 stage is characterized by short-term episodes of heart rate deceleration associated with motor activity; their duration and amplitude did not depend much on the force of movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At E19-20, decelerations typical of early gestation terms were replaced by acceleration-type reactions typical for mature organism, which is related to maturation of coordination function of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the heart rhythm, respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> appears during episodes of rhythmic breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Newborn rats demonstrated acceleration episodes; their parameters depend on the force of motor bouts; respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was not observed </plain></SENT>
