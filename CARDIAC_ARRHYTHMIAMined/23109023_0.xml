<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ciaglia and Griggs are two common <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few studies are available comparing these two methods, but there is no data available to compare these two techniques in Iranian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare Ciaglia and Griggs technique in our population in order to recognize advantages and disadvantages of each technique in order to identify the most beneficial one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study is a comparative clinical trial conducted on 100 consecutive ICU admitted patients who needed prolonged intubation; half of them underwent <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with Ciaglia method and other half with Griggs method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural time and short term complications including <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, vital signs instability and technical errors were compared in both two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Griggs method performed significantly faster than Ciaglia method (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications such as high grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (P=0.01) and cardiac dysrhythmias (P=0.07) were less in Ciaglia technique than Griggs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skin incision smaller than required was reported more with Griggs method than Ciaglia (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> with Ciaglia method is safer with less complications than the Griggs method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest use of Ciaglia for less experienced operators </plain></SENT>
