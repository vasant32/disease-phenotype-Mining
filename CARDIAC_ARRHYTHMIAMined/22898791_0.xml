<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare adherence rates to once-daily (q.d.) versus twice-daily (b.i.d.) dosing regimen of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medications in patients with nonvalvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed the PharMetrics Integrated Claims database from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult patients with continuous insurance coverage, newly initiated on <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medication, and having at least one AF diagnosis with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> or valve replacement procedures were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compliance to q.d. and b.i.d. therapies was calculated in two ways: medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence was defined as an MPR or PDC â‰¥0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to compare the probability of adherence between the q.d. and b.i.d. groups adjusting for baseline confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8,256 q.d. and 2,441 b.i.d. patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of exposure to therapy for q.d. and b.i.d. patients was 447 and 406 days (P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on MPR, 75.3% of q.d. and 70.4% of b.i.d. patients were adherent (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For PDC at 12 months, the proportion of adherent patients for the q.d. and b.i.d. groups was 56.5% and 49.6% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of adherence for the q.d. relative to b.i.d. group were 1.26 (1.13, 1.41) based on MPR and 1.23 (1.07, 1.41) based on PDC at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that nonvalvular AF patients treated with q.d. dosing regimens for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> medications were associated with approximately a 26% higher likelihood of adherence compared with subjects on b.i.d. regimens </plain></SENT>
