<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is compelling evidence that psychological factors may have the same or even greater impact on the possibility of adverse events on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> (CD) than other traditional clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> are predictors of short- and long-term adverse outcomes, increased risk for higher rates of in-hospital complications, re-infarction, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and mortality in CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite researchers finding that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) reduced depressive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms, the fact that such results are maintained only in the short term and the lack of maintenance of the long-term affects the absence of changes in lifestyles, preventing the possibility of a wide generalization of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently wellbeing therapy (WBT) has been proposed as a useful approach to improve healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The present randomized controlled study will test WBT, in comparison with CBT, as far as the reduction of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e>, and the improvement of lifestyle behaviors and quality of life in cardiac patients are concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, innovations in communication technologies allow patients to be constantly followed in real life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore WBT based on personalized mobile technology will allow the testing of its effectiveness in comparison with usual WBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The present study is a large outpatient study on the treatment of co-morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> in cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important issues of this study are its randomized design, the focus on promotion of health-related behaviors, and the use of innovative technologies supporting patients' wellbeing in real life and in a continuous way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>First results are expected in 2012 </plain></SENT>
