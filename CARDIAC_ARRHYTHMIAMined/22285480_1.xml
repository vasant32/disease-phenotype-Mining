<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that myocardial sleeves have the potential to generate automaticity in response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced automaticity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> cardiomyocytes isolated from rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Application of 10 μM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> cardiomyocytes induced repetitive and transient increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ca(2+) transient was accompanied by depolarization, and induced automatic rhythmic action potentials at approximately 4Hz in perforated patch clamp preparations in 27% of myocytes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the recording mode was switched from current-clamp to voltage-clamp mode during the continuous presence of automaticity, an oscillatory current was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oscillatory current was always inward, irrespective of the membrane potential, indicating that the current was derived mainly from the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced automaticity was suppressed by blocking either the β(1)- or α(1)-adrenoceptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this automaticity was blocked by inhibitors of phospholipase C and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 1,4,5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> receptor (IP(3)R) but not by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37700">protein kinase C inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed that the transverse-tubule system was enriched in cardiomyocytes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, in contrast to those of the atrium, and that the NCX and IP(3)R were co-localized along transverse tubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a functional coupling between the NCX and IP(3)R causes arrhythmic excitability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> during the presence of combined β(1)- and α(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation </plain></SENT>
