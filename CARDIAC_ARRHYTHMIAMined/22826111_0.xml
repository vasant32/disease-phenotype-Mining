<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One potential shared mechanism of this comorbidity is emotion dysregulation, which characterizes both internalizing and externalizing disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous research demonstrates that respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA)-a peripheral biomarker of emotion regulation-is attenuated among children with CD, and among children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have examined biomarkers of emotion regulation as a function of heterotypic comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated longitudinal patterns of RSA and RSA reactivity to emotion evocation across three annual assessments among 207 children diagnosed at ages 8-12 years with CD (n = 30), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (n = 28), comorbid CD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (n = 80), or no psychiatric condition (n = 69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using continuous symptom counts as predictors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> × CD interactions were observed for both Time 1 resting RSA and Time 1 RSA reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and their interaction were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with low resting RSA at Time 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, concurrently elevated CD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores predicted the greatest RSA reactivity to emotion evocation </plain></SENT>
