<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described a 42-year-old female patient without clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> which was diagnosed as ARVC by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the transvenous endomyocardial biopsy was not specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient received heart transplantation due to her refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and the pathology of explanted heart demonstrated typical replacement of fatty and fibrous tissue and piles of infiltrated lymphocytes in myocardial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that ARVC might not have any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and inflammatory process may be involved in the mechanism of ARVC </plain></SENT>
