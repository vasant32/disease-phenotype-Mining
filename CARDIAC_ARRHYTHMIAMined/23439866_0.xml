<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term prognosis of patients who received CRT-D or CRT-P according to class IA recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and who were enrolled in a multicentre prospective registry.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 620 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients underwent successful implantation of a CRT device and were enrolled in the Contak Italian Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis included 266 patients who received a CRT-D and 108 who received a CRT-P according to class IA ESC indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their survival status was verified after a median follow-up of 55 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 73 CRT-D and 44 CRT-P patients died (rate 6.6 vs. 10.4%/year; log-rank test, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving CRT-P were predominantly older, female, had no history of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and more frequently presented non-ischaemic aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, longer QRS durations, and worse renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause was the use of CRT-P (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-3.16; P = 0.007).CONCLUSION: The implantation of CRT-D, rather than CRT-P, may be preferable in patients presenting with current class IA ESC indications for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, CRT-D resulted in greater long-term survival and was independently associated with a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
