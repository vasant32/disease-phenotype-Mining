<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the toxicity to fish which were exposed to ammonia during early life stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study choose rare minnow which is unique to China for experimental subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Representative toxicological endpoints were observed and recorded during the development of embryo and yolk-sac stage larvae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, selected ammonia transporter protein Rhbg gene as a toxicity parameter to reflect the changes of rare minnow embryos Rhbg gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The result shows that ammonia we have chosen in this research had an influence on many toxic effects including the hatching rate of fry, mortality rate, the slowing of heart rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, unformed functional swim bladder, the decreasing of body length and weight and the occurrence of pericardium and yolk-sac <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But other toxicological endpoints have relatively weak effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ammonia also affect the Rhbg gene expression changes, especially that of Rhbg gene at 72 hours post-fertilization distinctly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rhbg may have important functions to facilitate ammonia transport during rare minnow embryo stages </plain></SENT>
