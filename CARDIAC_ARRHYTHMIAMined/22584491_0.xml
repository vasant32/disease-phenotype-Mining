<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Premature ventricular and supraventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and PsVC) are frequent and often symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) ion plays a role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of cell membranes and cardiac rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether the administration of Mg Pidolate (MgP) in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and PsVC is superior to placebo (P) in improving symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Randomized double-blind study with 60 consecutive symptomatic patients with more than 240 <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> or PsVC/h on 24-hour Holter monitoring who were selected to receive placebo (P) or MgP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate symptom improvement, a categorical and a specific questionnaire for symptoms related to <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and PsVC was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvement in premature complex density (PCD) per hour was considered significant if percentage reduction was &gt;70% after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose of MgP was 3.0 g/day for 30 days, equivalent to 260 mg of Mg element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any patient had structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 33 were female (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 16 to 70 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the MgP group, 76.6% of patients had a PCD reduction &gt;70%, 10% of them &gt;50% and only 13.4% &lt;50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the P group, 40% showed slight improvement, &lt;30%, in the PC frequency (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Symptom improvement was achieved in 93.3% of patients in the MgP group, compared with only 16.7% in the P group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral Mg supplementation decreases PCD, resulting in symptom improvement </plain></SENT>
