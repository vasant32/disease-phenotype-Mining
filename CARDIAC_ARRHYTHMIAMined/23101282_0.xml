<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has been rapidly increasing in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increased tonus of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system is related to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: TO study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi>, a highly selective beta-blocker, on patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (&lt; 48 hours) for regularization of the rhythm using propafenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study includes 164 patients (81 women, 83 men, age 59.09 +/- 10.81) with successfully restored sinus rhythm in recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients received either propafenone (group A, n = 82) or a combination of propafenone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi> (group B, n = 82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The studied patients were randomly allocated to the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Propafenone was administered intravenously as a 2 mg/kg bolus followed by infusion of 0.0078 mg/kg/min for 120 min and orally in dosage of 300 mg three times every 8 hours if <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">Bisoprolol</z:chebi> was administered in a single dose at the very beginning of propafenone treatment and only in patients from group B at a dose of 5 or 10 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regularization of the rhythm was assessed at the 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the initial stages of regularization the combined therapy restored the sinus rhythm in a greater number of patients in comparison with the monotherapy (at the 6th hour 67.07% in group B versus 48.78% in group A, P &lt; 0.05; at the 12th hour it was 87.80% versus 75.60%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early regularization of rhythm in patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> reduces the likelihood of recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This makes the application of selective beta-blockade clinically significant </plain></SENT>
