<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) are recommended for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation are derived from robust clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, critical factors which might influence treatment decisions include patient preferences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We set out to determine how clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) incorporate the patient perspective into supporting decision making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CPGs on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation were purposively selected from national and professional bodies in Europe, North America and Australasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CPGs were then appraised according to three key domains of shared decision making: (a) informing patients about the risks, benefits and consequences known to be important to patients; (b) personalising risks and benefits and (c) involvement of patient (plus family/significant others if desired) in decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Appraisal of six current CPGs found major deficiencies or inconsistencies in guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPGs tended to focus on evidence of device effectiveness, with sparse consideration of other outcomes important to patients such as impacts on quality of life and psychosocial well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Little reference was made to involvement of the patient in decision making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that embedding shared decision in CPGs will improve the patient-centeredness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment by enabling patients to make informed, value-based decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific recommendations for CPG development include the need for signposting to preference sensitive decision points as well as inclusion of a broader range of outcomes which are known to be important to patients when deciding whether or not to have a device fitted </plain></SENT>
