<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) activation is known to be associated with conditions where the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> is increased, and where cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)-overload occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether CaMKII inhibition in the intact heart may be linked to the suppression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring during reperfusion after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Non-paced male rat hearts (n = 8-11) were treated with a CaMKII inhibitor (KN93, 2.5 μmol/L) 10 min prior to global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (20 min) and for the initial 10 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mechanical and arrhythmic responses were evaluated under constant pressure perfusion conditions and myocyte damage assessed by measurement of coronary effluent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under basal conditions, KN93 increased coronary flow (41 ± 8% increase, p&lt;0.05) and was negatively inotropic (29 ± 7% decrease, p&lt;0.05), but did not affect heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> was significantly diminished in KN93-treated hearts (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, min: 11.48 ± 0.50 vs 16.27 ± 1.23, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition in early reperfusion almost completely abolished the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> in reperfusion (11/11 control vs 1/8 KN93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, heart rate was substantially reduced (% basal; 100 ± 3% vs 46 ± 8%, p&lt;0.05) throughout reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular developed pressure was initially low in KN93 hearts post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but recovered to control levels by the end of 60 min reperfusion (68 ± 5% vs 56 ± 5%, p = ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LDH was significantly reduced in KN93-treated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although CaMKII inhibition diminishes contractile performance of the intact heart in the initial post-ischemic period, it provides crucial benefits through protection against potentially lethal reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and cardiomyocyte sarcolemmal rupture </plain></SENT>
