<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper is concerned with the automatic control of drug administration in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada Syndrome</z:e> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drugs such as flecainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> and pilsicainide should be administrated under carefully controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring given that the treatment must be stopped if some ECG disturbing conditions appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These conditions are, among others the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and the widening of the QRS wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proposed system can detect these abnormalities by using a pattern recognition approach based on Hidden Markov Models (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi>) with features extracted from three scales of the Wavelet Transform (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performances higher than 98% were reached regarding the classification of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000306'>abnormal pulses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The system was trained and tested mainly in data from the standard <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
