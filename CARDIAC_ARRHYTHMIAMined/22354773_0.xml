<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to test whether there was a significant difference in the AV conduction properties between patients with and without clinically significant pauses who underwent ablation of longstanding persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-nine patients undergoing ablation of longstanding persistent AF were divided into three groups according to the extent of pauses documented on the ambulatory electrocardiogram during AF; patients without pauses (n = 25), with pauses of &lt;3 s (n = 52), and with pauses of ≥3 s (n = 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AV conduction properties, heart rate variability, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-related symptoms after conversion to sinus rhythm were compared across the three groups plus a control group (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sinus conversion was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found across the groups in the AV conduction properties including the AH and HV intervals, AV nodal effective refractory period, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A male gender (β = 0.32; p = 0.0016), structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (β = 0.24; p = 0.02), and the AA interval right after ablation (β = 0.35; p = 0.0014), rather than the AV conduction properties, were independent determinants of the longest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RR interval during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients experienced any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-related symptoms after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No AV conduction abnormalities were necessarily identified after the ablation even among the patients suspected of having an AV conduction disturbance during AF </plain></SENT>
