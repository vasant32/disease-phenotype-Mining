<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the autonomic cardiac function and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in DS patients by evaluating QT and P wave dispersion and heart rate variability (HRV) using standard electrocardiography (ECG) and 24-h ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 15 patients (9 boys and 6 girls aged 3.5-17 years) who were genetically diagnosed with DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group comprised 20 healthy subjects, 13 boys and 7 girls aged 4-17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion (44.6 ± 3.5 ms), QT dispersion (58.8 ± 7.5 ms) and QTc dispersion (70.8 ± 7.4 ms) were significantly higher in DS patients as compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in PR, QT or QTc length between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24-h Holter ECG showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HRV parameters were significantly lower in patients with DS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decreased HRV and increased P wave and QT dispersion seen in DS patients are important signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> with increased adrenergic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> is correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SUDEP</z:e> in DS, long-term electrocardiographic monitoring and wider prospective studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
