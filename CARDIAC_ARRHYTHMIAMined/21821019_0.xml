<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of ivabradine on maximum rate of depolarization (V(max)), repolarization and spontaneous depolarization have not yet been reported in human isolated cardiac preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same applies to large animals close to human in heart size and spontaneous frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using microelectrode technique action potential characteristics and by applying patch-clamp technique ionic currents were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine exerted concentration-dependent (0.1-10 μM) decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous diastolic depolarization and reduction in spontaneous rate of firing of action potentials and produced a concentration- and frequency-dependent V(max) block in dog Purkinje fibers while action potential duration measured at 50% of repolarization was shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the presence of ivabradine, at 400 ms cycle length, V(max) block developed with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> kinetic rate constant of 13.9 ± 3.2 beat(-1) in dog ventricular muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to a fast recovery of V(max) from inactivation (τ=41-46 ms) observed in control, a second slow component for recovery of V(max) was expressed (offset kinetics of V(max) block) having a time constant of 8.76 ± 1.34 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In dog after attenuation of the repolarization reserve ivabradine moderately but significantly lengthened the repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In human, significant prolongation of repolarization was only observed at 10 μM ivabradine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine in addition to the Class V antiarrhythmic effect also has Class I/C and Class III antiarrhythmic properties, which can be advantageous in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> liable to disturbances of cardiac rhythm </plain></SENT>
