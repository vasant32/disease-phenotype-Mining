<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is utilized in defibrillation to reestablish <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> contraction rhythms during dangerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If shock-induced transmembrane potentials are large enough, they can cause tissue destruction due to irreversible electroporation (EP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also electrochemotherapy of nearby tissues may have an adverse effect on the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present experimental data on effects of electroporation in culture of cardiac cells (H9C2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electric field was applied in short pulses of 25-3250 V/cm, 50 Âµs each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The viability of cells was tested by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For detection of DNA fragmentation, associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, alkaline and neutral comet assays were performed after EP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally phase contrast images of cells obtained directly after EP were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although cell images indicated disruption of cell membranes after EP with high intensities, only a few percent of apoptotic cells and no necrotic effects in the cell nucleus could be observed in comet assay tests performed 2 hours post EP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> viability test showed that pulse intensities above 375 V/cm are destructive for myocytes viability </plain></SENT>
