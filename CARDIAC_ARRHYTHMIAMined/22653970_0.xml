<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for most of these mutations, nothing is known about the molecular mechanism linking Kv11.1 malfunction to cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that disease-related mutations that create consensus sites for kinases on ion channels can dramatically change ion channel activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that a LQT2-associated mutation can inhibit Kv11.1 ion channel activity by perturbing a consensus site for the Ser/Thr protein kinase C α (PKCα) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We first reveal by mass spectrometry analysis that Ser890 of the Kv11.1 ion channel is phosphorylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then, we demonstrate by a phospho-detection immunoassay combined with genetic manipulation that PKCα phosphorylates Ser890 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that Ser890 phosphorylation is associated with an increase in Kv11.1 membrane density with alteration of recovery from inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a newly discovered and as yet uncharacterized LQT2-associated nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism 2660 G→A within the human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-á-go-go-related gene 1 coding sequence, which replaces arginine 887 with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32535">histidine residue</z:chebi> (R887H), strongly inhibits PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of residue Ser890 on Kv11.1, and ultimately inhibits surface expression and current density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data provide a functional link between this channel mutation and LQT2 </plain></SENT>
