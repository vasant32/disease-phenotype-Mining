<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ventricular late potentials (VLPs) detected in the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) may imply an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six AED-na√Øve patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and no clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were examined with SAECG and standard ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were treated with lamotrigine and ten with carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant abnormality was found in the standard ECG or SAECG three to nine months after initiation of AED therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, a VLP was detected at baseline and subsequent MRI demonstrated significant right ventricular pathology; therefore, this patient was excluded from the rest of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This exclusion along with only newly diagnosed patients with a low total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> count being included in the study may explain the lack of AED-induced electrocardiographic abnormalities in this patient cohort </plain></SENT>
