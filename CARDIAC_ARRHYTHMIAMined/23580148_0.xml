<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: High-fidelity 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is important for physiological monitoring of patients during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-guided intervention and cardiac MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Issues in obtaining noncorrupted ECGs inside MRI include a superimposed magneto-hydro-dynamic voltage, gradient switching-induced voltages, and radiofrequency heating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These problems increase with magnetic field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to develop and clinically validate a 1.5T MRI-conditional 12-lead ECG system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The system was constructed including transmission lines to reduce radiofrequency induction and switching circuits to remove induced voltages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adaptive filters, trained by 12-lead measurements outside MRI and in two orientations inside MRI, were used to remove magneto-hydro-dynamic voltage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The system was tested on 10 (one exercising) volunteers and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Switching circuits removed most imaging-induced voltages (residual noise &lt;3% of the R-wave) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magneto-hydro-dynamic voltage removal provided intra-MRI ECGs that varied by &lt;3.8% from those outside the MRI, preserving the true S-wave to T-wave segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) patients, clean ECGs separated <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> and sinus rhythm beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measured heating was &lt;1.5°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The system reliably acquired multiphase (steady-state free precession) wall-motion-cine and phase-contrast-cine scans, including subjects in whom 4-lead gating failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The system required a minimum repetition time of 4 ms to allow robust ECG processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-fidelity intra-MRI 12-lead ECG is possible </plain></SENT>
