<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The QT interval reflects the total duration of ventricular myocardial repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disturbed QT--either prolonged or shortened--is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and is life-threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate an elderly population for disturbed QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on residents of long-term care wards in a geriatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excluded were those with pacemaker, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The standard 12 lead and lead 2 electrocardiograms in the patients' files were used for the evaluation of QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We screened the ECGs of 178 residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QTc prolongation based on the mean 12 ECG leads was detected in 48 (28%), while 45 (25%) had prolonged QTc based on lead L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with QT prolongation were male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Short QT was found in 7 residents (4%) and was not related to any parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of the elderly long-term care residents in our study had QT disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such a considerable number warrants close QT interval follow-up in predisposed patients </plain></SENT>
