<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basis for this use is likely related to inhibition of late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels with resultant beneficial downstream effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated an improvement in exercise capacity and reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> episodes with ranolazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic benefit occurs without the hemodynamic effects seen with the conventional antianginal agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels as well as other ion currents has a central role in the potential use of ranolazine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite its QTc-prolonging action, albeit minimal, clinical data have not shown a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo>, and the medication has shown a reasonable safety profile even in those with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article we present the experimental and clinical data that support its current therapeutic role, and provide insight into potential future clinical applications </plain></SENT>
