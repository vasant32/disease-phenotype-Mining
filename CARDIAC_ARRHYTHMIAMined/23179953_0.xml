<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> (100 mg/Kg/day, ig) for 14 days and controls treated with water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hearts were isolated in vitro and perfused in the Langendorff mode and subjected to 30 min of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 30 min of reperfusion and hemodynamic data examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a separate set of experiments, hearts were subjected in vivo to left anterior descending coronary artery ligation for 30 min followed by 120 min reperfusion and hemodynamic data, type and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) level, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>/ATP and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>/ATP ratios were examined in non-ischemic areas and risk areas of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury, left ventricular developed pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure and maximum rate of intraventricular pressure contractility and relaxation were significantly improved in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> treatment groups compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> treatment decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and diminished the duration and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreased AMPK protein concentration, and the ratio of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>/ATP and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>/ATP in the myocardial risk areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> treatment significantly increased AMPK protein concentration, and the ratio of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>/ATP and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>/ATP in the non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> areas compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> may exert its cardioprotective effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury via regulation of AMPK activity in both non-ischemic areas and risk areas of the heart </plain></SENT>
