<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: RECORDAF is the first worldwide, prospective, observational survey of management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in unselected, community-based patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Primary outcomes were therapeutic success and clinical outcomes associated with rhythm-control and rate-control strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF were included (n = 5,604) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategy (rhythm control or rate control) was noted at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic success required that strategy was unchanged without clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further maintenance of sinus rhythm was required in the rhythm-control group, and heart rate â‰¤80 beats/min in the rate-control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 5,171 patients were assessable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic success was 54% overall (rhythm control 60% vs. rate control 47%), a result driven by control of AF: rhythm control, 81% vs. rate control, 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for propensity score quintiles, the rhythm-control strategy was significantly related to superior therapeutic success (odds ratio: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.55; p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical events occurred in 18% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> management strategy was not predictive of clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The type (persistent), presence at baseline visit, and duration (&gt;3 months) of AF, together with age older than 75 years and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, predicted progression to permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The choice of rhythm control reduced the likelihood of AF progression (odds ratio: 0.20, 95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.25; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes in AF patients were driven mainly by hospitalizations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>/proarrhythmia and other cardiovascular causes, but not by the choice of rate or rhythm strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rhythm-control patients progressed less rapidly to permanent AF </plain></SENT>
