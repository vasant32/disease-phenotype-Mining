<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of scheduled ambulatory visits is unproductive and imposes a heavy burden on the health-care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The COMPAS randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority trial examined the safety of long-term remote monitoring of pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between December 2005 and January 2008, 538 patients were randomly assigned to remote monitoring follow-up (active group) vs. standard care (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to confirm that the proportion of patients who experienced at least one major adverse event (MAE), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and hospitalizations for device-related or cardiovascular adverse events, was not &gt;7% higher in the active than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAE-free survivals and quality of life were compared in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the study groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over a follow-up of 18.3 months, 17.3% of patients in the active and 19.1% in the control group experienced at least one MAE (P &lt; 0.01 for non-inferiority) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hospitalizations for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (6 vs. 18) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2 vs. 8) were fewer (P &lt; 0.05), and the number of interim ambulatory visits was 56% lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the active than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in pacemaker programming or drug regimens were made in 62% of visits in the active vs. 29% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quality of life remained unchanged in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring was a safe alternative to conventional care and significantly lowered the number of ambulatory visits during long-term follow-up of permanently paced patients </plain></SENT>
