<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a longitudinal study on elite runners of the 2010 Jungfrau Marathon, a Swiss mountain marathon, to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects of long-distance running on the atrial myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy male athletes were included and examined 9 to 1 week prior to the race, immediately after, and 1, 5, and 8 days after the race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 34.9 ± 4.2 years, and maximum oxygen consumption was 66.8 ± 5.8 mL/kg*min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean race time was 243.9 ± 17.7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographic-determined signal-averaged P-wave duration (SAPWD) increased significantly after the race and returned to baseline levels during follow-up (128.7 ± 10.9 vs. 137.6 ± 9.8 vs. 131.5 ± 8.6 ms; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left and right atrial volumes showed no significant differences over time, and there were no correlations of atrial volumes and SAPWD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of the SAPWD was accompanied by a transient increase in levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines, total leucocytes, neutrophil granulocytes, pro atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and high-sensitivity troponin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, marathon running was associated with a transient conduction delay in the atria, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and increased atrial wall tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may reflect exercise-induced atrial myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and may contribute to atrial remodeling over time, generating a substrate for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
