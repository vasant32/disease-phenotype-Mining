<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is mediated by diastolic Ca(2+) overload and increased Ca(2+) leak through the RyR2 channel, implying that treatment targeting these defects might be efficacious in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> mouse models that lack CASQ2 were treated with Ca(2+) -channel inhibitors, Î²-adrenergic inhibitors, or Mg(2+)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein expression and Ca(2+) transients of isolated myocytes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each study agent reduced the frequency of stress-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in mutant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ca(2+) channel blocker <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was most efficacious and completely prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 85% of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> significantly increased the SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes, diminished diastolic Ca(2+) overload, increased systolic Ca(2+) amplitude, and prevented Ca(2+) oscillations in stressed mutant myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ca(2+) channel inhibition by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> rectified abnormal calcium handling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> myocytes and prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi>-induced partial normalization of SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes implicates CASQ2 as modulator of RyR2 activity, rather than or in addition to, Ca(2+) buffer protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Agents such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> that attenuate cardiomyocyte calcium overload are appropriate for assessing clinical efficacy in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
