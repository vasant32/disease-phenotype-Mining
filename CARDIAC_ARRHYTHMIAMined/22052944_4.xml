<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inherited type 2 LQTS (LQT2) and drug-induced LQTS both result from altered function of the hERG channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the electrophysiological characteristics of LQT2 can be recapitulated in vitro using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were differentiated from two iPSC lines derived from an individual with LQT2 carrying the R176W mutation in the KCNH2 (HERG) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The individual had been asymptomatic except for occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, but his sister and father had died suddenly at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological properties of LQT2-specific cardiomyocytes were studied using microelectrode array and patch-clamp, and were compared with those of cardiomyocytes derived from control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The action potential duration of LQT2-specific cardiomyocytes was significantly longer than that of control cardiomyocytes, and the rapid delayed <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (I(Kr)) density of the LQT2 cardiomyocytes was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, LQT2-derived cardiac cells were more sensitive than controls to potentially arrhythmogenic drugs, including sotalol, and demonstrated arrhythmogenic electrical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with clinical observations, the LQT2 cardiomyocytes demonstrated a more pronounced inverse correlation between the beating rate and repolarization time compared with control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prolonged action potential is present in LQT2-specific cardiomyocytes derived from a mutation carrier and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be triggered by a commonly used drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the iPSC-derived, disease-specific cardiomyocytes could serve as an important platform to study pathophysiological mechanisms and drug sensitivity in LQT2 </plain></SENT>
