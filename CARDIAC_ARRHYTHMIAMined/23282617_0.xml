<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a 28-year-old male with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> of the left ventricle, localized in the lateral and posterior wall, which involved the mitral valve and circumflex artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a complete study ruling out dissemination of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, the patient was operated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration determined the unresectabilility of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with the heart in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the heart was explanted, preserving the right atrium and coronary sinus for re-implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the mitral valve and the circumflex artery from its origin, were resected due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The heart was reconstructed with bovine pericardium and a mechanical valve was implanted in the mitral position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Afterward, the heart was implanted again following the same sequence as in bicaval transplantation, followed by a double bypass grafting to the distal circumflex territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had no significant complications and after nine months of follow up, there was no evidence of local recurrence </plain></SENT>
