<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> is an important issue in the field of perioperative nursing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to verify the usefulness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-stage bright light exposure on patients following oesophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The participants were oesophagectomy patients that were removed from their ventilators the day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After extubation, we assigned the participants to either the exposure group or control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At Day 2 after surgery, the exposure group underwent two hours of bright light exposure for four days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both groups, we monitored physical activity and autonomic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we scored the participants on the NEECHAM Scale and evaluated their postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On the nights of Days 4 and 5, the amount of activity of the exposure group was significantly lower and The sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> index was significantly lower on the night of Day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was lower in the exposure group and we observed a significant difference on the night of Day 4 and the daytime of Day 5 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence rate of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> tended to be lower in the exposure group, but there was no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the participants in the exposure group had NEECHAM Scale scores below the cut-off value from the night of Day 4 onwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that postoperative bright light exposure adjusted the sleep-wakefulness cycle and improved the bed rest of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was also indicated that bright light therapy is useful for reducing postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> </plain></SENT>
