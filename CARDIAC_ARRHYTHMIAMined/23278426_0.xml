<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008200'>primary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> (PHPT) during bicycle ergometer exercise test (ET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty PHPT postmenopausal women (mean age, 60·9 ± 8·0 years) and 30, sex and age-matched, controls underwent ET, echocardiogram and mineral metabolism biochemical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following stages were considered during ET: rest, peak exercise, recovery (early recovery, 2 and 10 min after peak exercise) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QT was corrected with Bazett's formula (QTc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, PHPT patients showed an increased occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp>) during ET (26·6% vs. 6·6%, P = 0·03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Being affected by PHPT predicted the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> at peak exercise (P = 0·04) and recovery (P = 0·03), as shown by logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In PHPT patients, serum calcium level was a predictor of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> at peak exercise (P = 0·05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QTc in patients with PHPT was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum calcium level showed a negative correlation with QTc (P = 0·01) in whole sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, PHTP patients had QTc significantly shorter for every stage of ET, except at peak exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Physiological reduction of QTc interval from rest to peak exercise was not seen in patients with PHPT, QTc at rest being the only predictor of QTc in every stage, as shown by multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PHPT, an increased occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> and a different QTc adaptation during ET were observed and may represent risk factors for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
