<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that myocardial scars cause systolic dysfunction in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> and a systemic right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 20 consecutive patients (10 male, mean age 27.3 years) with a systemic right ventricle who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cine steady-state free-precession sequences were performed to obtain volumes and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase-sensitive inversion-recovery (PSIR) delayed-enhancement imaging was performed to detect myocardial scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>Tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> was detected with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean ejection fraction of systemic right ventricles was 43 ± 11 %, mean end-diastolic volume index was 111 ± 37 ml/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Delayed-enhancement imaging revealed only one myocardial scar in the wall of a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0006698'>ventricular aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but one (95 %) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were present in 13/20 patients (65 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (90 %) were NYHA class I or II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> and NYHA class were not associated with right ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although right ventricular function was clearly impaired in our patient cohort, there was only one myocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that myocardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> assessed by PSIR delayed-enhancement imaging is not the underlying pathology of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
