<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, a crucial regulator of the developing cardiovascular system, can provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the embryonic/fetal heart remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to establish a mechanistic basis of how an adenosinergic stimulation alters function of the developing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously beating hearts or dissected atria and ventricle obtained from 4-day-old chick embryos were exposed to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> or specific <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of the receptors A(1)AR (CCPA), A(2A)AR (CGS-21680) and A(3)AR (IB-MECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the receptors was determined by quantitative PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional consequences of blockade of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and L-type calcium channel (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e>) in combination with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> or CCPA, were investigated in vitro by electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the time-course of ERK phosphorylation was determined by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of A(1)AR, A(2A)AR and A(2B)AR was higher in atria than in ventricle while A(3)AR was equally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> (100Î¼M) triggered transient atrial ectopy and second degree atrio-ventricular blocks (AVB) whereas CCPA induced mainly Mobitz type I AVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atrial rhythm and atrio-ventricular propagation fully recovered after 60min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were prevented by the specific A(1)AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> DPCPX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> and CCPA transiently increased ERK phosphorylation and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in isolated atria but not in ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, A(2A)AR and A(3)AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the proarrhythmic effect of A(1)AR stimulation was markedly reduced by inhibition of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, ERK, PLC, PKC or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase inhibition or <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> MPG prevented both A(1)AR-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and ERK phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that pacemaking and conduction disturbances are induced via A(1)AR through concomitant stimulation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase and PLC, followed by downstream activation of ERK and PKC with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCC</z:e> as possible target </plain></SENT>
