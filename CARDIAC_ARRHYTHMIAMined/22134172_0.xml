<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pharmacological stress is often used, and the drugs most frequently utilized are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (Dip) and dobutamine (Dob) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the safety and the results obtained with a new protocol associating Dip, Dob, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, compared with the Dip protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent rest Tl/Dip stress Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion tomography on the same day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dip was administered intravenously (0.56 mg/kg) for 4 min, and Tc-sestamibi was injected 3 min after the end of the Dip injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On another day, patients received the same Dip dose, immediately followed by the infusion of Dob [20 μg/kg/min for the first 2 min and 40 μg/kg/min in the next 2 min, with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (1 mg) given in the interval between the two Dob doses] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were acquired with a two-detector camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a 17-segment model of the left ventricle, each segment was automatically scored 0-4 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to absent radiotracer activity), and perfusion scores were obtained as the sum of stress score and sum of rest segmental score (SSS and SRS, respectively) and the difference between them [summed difference score (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> scans were interpreted by two experienced physicians as either definitely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, probably <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, probably abnormal, or definitely abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No serious complication was found independently of the protocol used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar in both protocols at the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maximum heart rate (126 ± 21 vs. 82.7 ± 13.6, P&lt;0.001) and the double product (18816 ± 4194 vs. 11449 ± 2438, P&lt;0.001) showed a significant increase in the tests that used Dob and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> compared with the Dip protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stress studies with Dip-Dob had higher SSS compared with the Dip protocol (9.4 ± 10.1 vs. 7.7 ± 8.8, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> was also higher in the Dip-Dob protocol than in the Dip protocol (6.1 ± 6.8 and 4.8 ± 5.8, respectively, P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This work shows that a new protocol of pharmacological stress with a combination of Dip, Dob, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> is safe, easy to administer, and results in larger stress-induced defect size and reversibility of myocardial perfusion </plain></SENT>
