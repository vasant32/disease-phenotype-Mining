<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- A systematic, comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE until 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracted data from the eligible studies were meta-analyzed using fixed effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four studies, which included 95 526 subjects, were eligible for meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the studies included, the extreme groups (ie, maximum versus minimal amount of physical activity) were used for the current analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of participants belonging to the extreme groups was 43 672 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among regular exercisers was 1.08 (0.97-1.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Our data do not support a statistically significant association between regular physical activity and increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
