<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A significant abrupt drop in heart rate is the most frequent complication during percutaneous microballoon compression of the trigeminal ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that co-activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems plays an important role in this occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that not only <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, but also <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> might be effective in preventing this cardiovascular reflex during percutaneous microballoon compression of the trigeminal ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent percutaneous microballoon compression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> between September 2007 and December 2009 were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the hemodynamic changes and intraoperative use of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> (0.01 mg/kg) or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> (0.05 mg/kg) was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-way analysis of variance with Bartlett's and Tukey's post-tests was used, and a value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 119 patients who received percutaneous microballoon compression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> were studied, of whom 38 received <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> before ganglion compression, 36 received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi>, and 45 received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, 31.3% had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (heart rate &lt; 50 beats/min), 13.3% had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (heart rate &lt; 40 beats/min), and 7% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who received <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, 7.8% had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, 7.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and 5.3% had postcompression <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> by the end of ganglion compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi>, 16.7% had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, 5.6% had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, and 2.8% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Systemic blood pressure was markedly elevated straight after compression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and tended to normalize 3 minutes afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> were able to lower the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither of them could abolish episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> before microballoon compression were subject to a smaller change in hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings verified that the sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems may be involved in the complex interneuronal interaction of the trigeminocardiac reflex </plain></SENT>
