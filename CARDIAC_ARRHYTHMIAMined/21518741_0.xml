<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This situation threatens access to appropriate care, and a more or less explicit rationing of some types of treatment may occur in 'real world' clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true for those treatments or interventions with a relatively high up-front cost, such as cardioverter defibrillators, devices for cardiac resynchronization therapy or ablation procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
