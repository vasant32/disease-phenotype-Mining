<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Atrial Preference Pacing (APP) is a pacemaker (PM) algorithm that supports a continuous atrial stimulation instead of a spontaneous atrial rhythm to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of the APP in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of preventive atrial pacing on AF incidence in myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> type I patients during a 12-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 40 patients with myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> type 1 (MD1) who underwent dual-chamber PM implantation for first- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011706'>second-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 1-month stabilization period, they were randomized to APP algorithm programmed OFF or ON for 6 months each, using a cross-over design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of AF episodes during active treatment (APP ON phases) was lower than those registered during no treatment (APP OFF phases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found in AF episodes duration between the two phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the APP OFF phases and APP ON phases, the atrial pacing percentage was 0 and 98%, respectively, while the ventricular pacing percentage did not show statistically significant difference (10 vs. 8%, P =0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Atrial premature beats</z:e> count was significantly greater during APP OFF phases than during APP ON phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lead parameters remained stable over time and there were no lead-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these 12-month follow-up data, it is concluded that APP is an efficacy algorithm for preventing paroxysmal AF in MD1 patients who underwent dual-chamber PM implantation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1627362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrioventricular conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
