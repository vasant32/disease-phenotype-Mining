<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently unknown whether long-term voluntary exercise has enduring cardioprotective effects in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted in three groups of rats: (i) sedentary controls (n = 6); (ii) 24 h runners (n = 8; unlimited access to running wheels); and (iii) 2 h runners (n = 8; access to running wheels limited to 2 h daily) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After termination of the 6 week exercise protocol, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were implanted with the telemetric electrocardiogram transmitters and were studied 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting heart rate (HR) values in the control rats, 24 h runners and 2 h runners were 372 ± 7, 361 ± 9 and 298 ± 5 b.p.m., respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for 2 h runners vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high-frequency spectral power in the control rats, 24 h runners and 2 h runners was 3.9 ± 0.2, 4.3 ± 0.3 and 5.3 ± 0.3 s², respectively (P &lt; 0.05 for 2 h runners vs controls), whereas intrinsic HR was 383 ± 3, 377 ± 2 and 346 ± 3 b.p.m., respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for 2 h runners vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restraint stress provoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> of similar magnitude in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After completion of telemetric studies, haemodynamic indices and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were assessed in anaesthetized animals, there were no major between-group differences in HR, arterial pressure, contractility indices or sensitivity to β-adrenoceptor stimulation (dobutamine) or blockade (atenolol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effective refractory period in the control rats, 24 h runners and 2 h runners was 49 ± 2, 55 ± 2 and 60 ± 4 ms, respectively (P = 0.054 for 2 h runners vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> was required to provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the 24 h and 2 h running groups compared with controls (489 ± 76, 505 ± 88 and 173 ± 33 μg, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in rats, long-term voluntary exercise has enduring cardioprotective effects mediated at the level of both the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and the heart </plain></SENT>
