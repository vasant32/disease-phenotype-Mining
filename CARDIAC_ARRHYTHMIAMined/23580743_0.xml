<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High frequency stimulation (HFS) is used to identify GP sites in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of ablation on neural pathways connecting GPs in humans is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -30 patients undergoing LA ablation with autonomic modification were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with persistent AF, endocardial cont-HFS identified GP sites producing <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following right lower GP (RLGP) ablation (N=5), 2 of 15 sites remained positive whereas following ablation of other GPs (N=5), leaving RLGP intact, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 sites remained positive (RLGP vs Other GP p&lt;0.005), indicating that neural pathways between LA GPs and the AV node are via the RLGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 20 patients with paroxysmal AF, sync-HFS identified sites initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ectopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (N=8) no sites remained positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following local GP ablation (N=9) 3 of 14 sites remained positive suggesting neural connections to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> were disrupted by both PVI and GP ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability indices reduced significantly after right upper GP (RUGP) ablation alone, suggesting that neural pathways from the LA to the SA node travel via the RUGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -We have demonstrated neural pathways connecting LA GPs with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, AV node and SA node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects of HFS at GP sites can be prevented by ablating the GP site or the neural pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This further delineates the mechanism via which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation prevents AF and highlights important caveats for autonomic modification endpoints </plain></SENT>
