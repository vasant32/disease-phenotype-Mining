<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is related to the pathophysiologic development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) and is inversely associated with adverse outcomes during hospitalization for HF (HHF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of SBP after initiating inhospital therapy and the mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and etiology of cardiovascular readmissions based on SBP have not been well characterized in HHF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A post hoc analysis was performed of the placebo group (n = 2061) of the EVEREST trial, which enrolled patients within 48 hours of admission for worsening HF with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤40% and an SBP ≥90 mm Hg, for a median follow-up of 9.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure was measured at baseline, daily during hospitalization, and at discharge/day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into the following quartiles by SBP at baseline: ≤105, 106 to 119, 120 to 130, and ≥131 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (ACM) and the composite of cardiovascular mortality or HHF (CVM + HHF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations between baseline, discharge, and inhospital change in SBP and ACM and CVM + HHF were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for known covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median (25th, 75th) SBP at baseline was 120 (105, 130) mm Hg and ranged from 82 to 202 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a lower SBP were younger and more likely to be male; had a higher prevalence of prior revascularization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>; had a lower EF, worse renal function, higher natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations, and wider QRS durations; and were more likely to require intravenous inotropes during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lower SBP was associated with increased mortality, driven by HF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and cardiovascular hospitalization, primarily caused by HHF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for potential confounders, SBP was inversely associated with risk of the coprimary end points both at baseline (ACM: hazard ratio [HR]/10-mm Hg decrease 1.15, 95% CI1.08-1.22; CVM + HHF: HR 1.09/10-mm Hg decrease, 95% CI 1.04-1.14) and at the time of discharge/day 7 (ACM: HR 1.15/10-mm Hg decrease, 95% CI 1.08-1.22; CVM + HHF: HR 1.07/10-mm Hg decrease, 95% CI 1.02-1.13), but the association with inhospital SBP change was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systolic blood pressure is an independent clinical predictor of morbidity and mortality after initial therapy during HHF with reduced EF </plain></SENT>
