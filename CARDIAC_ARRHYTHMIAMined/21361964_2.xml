<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a population sample of adolescents (N=715, 50.9% girls, mean age 16.11 years, SD=0.59), we tested three hypotheses: (1) perceived responses during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871388" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">social stress</z:e> covary with concurrent physiological stress responses; (2) high pretest levels of perceived stress predict large physiological responses; and (3) large physiological responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871388" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">social stress</z:e> predict low posttest perceived stress levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perceived arousal, unpleasantness, and dominance were related to heart rate, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> responses to a laboratory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871388" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">social stress</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although effect sizes were small, the results suggest covariation of perceived stress and concurrent physiological stress responses in both the ANS and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> axis, as well as inverse associations between heart rate responsiveness and the subsequent appraisal of stress </plain></SENT>
