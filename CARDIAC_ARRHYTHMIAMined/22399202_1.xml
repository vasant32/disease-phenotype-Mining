<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Removed CIED leads and pocket material were seeded on solid media and isolates tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with the Kirby Bauer method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrodes from 1204 patients were analysed and 854 (70.9%) tested positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 663 (77.6%) cases only one species was isolated, in 175 (20.5%) two species, and in 14 (1.8%) &gt;2 species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 116 cases material from the pocket was also cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result was consistent with that from the electrodes in 69 (59%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 359 cases a blood sample was also obtained for culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result was consistent with that from the leads in 124 (35%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 1068 strains were isolated from electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>Gram-positive</z:mp> organisms were most frequently isolated (92.5% of isolates); particularly, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis, in 69% of cases and Staphylococcus aureus in 13.8%, <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> rods in 6.1%, yeasts in 1% and molds in 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7809">Oxacillin</z:chebi> resistance was 30%, in particular 33% among CoNS and 13% among S. aureus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7809">Oxacillin</z:chebi> resistance and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23765">quinolones</z:chebi> resistance have increased in the period 2006-2011 with respect to the 5 years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen percent of Enterobacteriaceae strains had a phenotype compatible with extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Culture of the leads offers the possibility of an aetiological diagnosis in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When material from the pocket can be obtained, the microbiological result is often consistent with that from the electrodes, while species isolated from blood cultures are often different and more likely to be the result of contamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cardiac implantable electronic device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is more often monomicrobial, CoNS are most frequently isolated and S. epidermidis is largely the main single agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Very early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were associated with S. aureus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The pattern of susceptibility to antimicrobials is in general that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">community-acquired infections</z:e>, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7809">oxacillin</z:chebi> resistance and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23765">quinolones</z:chebi> resistance has increased in the last 5 years </plain></SENT>
