<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are, however, few descriptions concerning systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle (LV) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion (QTd) is simple noninvasive arrhythmogenic marker that can be used to assess homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and which has not been studied in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> patients before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A recent study found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients had an abnormally longer QTd and corrected QT (cQTd) dispersion, markers for ventricular arrhythmogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study assessed QTd and cQTd and their relation with systolic and diastolic function of the LV in a group of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We performed electrocardiography and Doppler echocardiography on patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum QT (QTmax), minimum QT (QTmin), QTd, corrected QT, maximum corrected QT (cQTmax), minimum corrected QT (cQTmin) and cQTd intervals were measured from standard 12-lead electrocardiography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the diastolic parameters, increased late flow velocity, decreased early flow velocity and prolonged isovolumic relaxation time reflected an abnormal relaxation form of diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
