<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In situ, RyR2 gating is modulated by numerous physiological and pharmacological agents, and altered RyR2 function underlies the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in both inherited and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand fully the mechanisms underpinning the regulation of RyR2 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart and how these systems are altered in pathological conditions, we must first gain a detailed knowledge of the fundamental processes of RyR2 gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, we provide key novel mechanistic insights into the physical reality of RyR2 gating revealed by new experimental and analytical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have examined in detail the single-channel gating kinetics of the purified human RyR2 when activated by cytosolic Ca(2+) in a stringently regulated environment where the modulatory influence of factors external to the channel were minimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resulting gating schemes are based on an accurate description of single-channel kinetics using hidden Markov model analysis and reveal several novel aspects of RyR2 gating behavior: (a) constitutive gating is observed as unliganded opening events; (b) binding of Ca(2+) to the channel stabilizes it in different open states; (c) RyR2 exists in two preopening closed conformations in equilibrium, one of which binds Ca(2+) more readily than the other; (d) the gating of RyR2 when bound to Ca(2+) can be described by a kinetic scheme incorporating bursts; and (e) analysis of flicker closing events within bursts reveals gating activity that is not influenced by ligand binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gating schemes generated in this investigation provide a framework for future studies in which the mechanisms of action of key physiological regulatory factors, disease-linked mutations, and potential therapeutic compounds can be described precisely </plain></SENT>
