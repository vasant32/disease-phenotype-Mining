<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical experiences on correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> with robotic technology at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2007 and May 2012, this retrospective study recruited 160 consecutive patients undergoing robotic surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 74 males and 86 females with a median age of 35 years (range: 11-62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedures included secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> repair (n = 130), ostium primum defect repair (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> repair (n = 21), mitral valve repair for anterior leaflet cleft (n = 7) and mitral valve repair plus left <z:mp ids='MP_0003392'>atrial myxoma</z:mp> resection (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary bypass graft was established through cannulation of right femoral artery, vein and right internal jugular vein under the guidance of transesophageal ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocardial protection was performed with cold blood cardioplegic solution or HTK solution and a transthoracic Chitwood clamp was used to occlude ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Via three 8-mm ports and one 15-mm port in right chest, the microscopic instruments were manipulated to complete defect closure or mitral valve plasty, utilizing da Vinci S or da Vinci SI robotic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography was performed intraoperatively and at pre-discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Routine follow-ups were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical data of operating time, cardiopulmonary bypass time and follow-up examinations were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were treated successfully without a conversion into median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No operative mortality or severe surgical complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six cases of secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> were completed on beating heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The learning curves were noted for operating time of beating heart group and cross clamp time of arrest heart group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No residual shunt, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> was detected on intraoperative or postoperative echocardiography and during a median follow-up period of (29.1 Â± 16.3) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Robotic minimal access is technically feasible and it may be applied in selective patients with atrial septel defect, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> and mitral valve cleft </plain></SENT>
