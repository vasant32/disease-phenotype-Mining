<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence and evolution of incomplete occlusion of the LAA during and after placement of the WATCHMAN device has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight consecutive patients who had undergone WATCHMAN device implant were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural, 45-day and 12-month transesophageal echocardiogram images were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peridevice gap was noted in 16 (27.6%), 17 (29.3%), and 20 (34.5%) patients across the 3 time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural gaps are more likely to be persistent until 12 months and become larger in size over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New gap also occurs during follow-up even if the LAA was completely sealed at implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> 4.7 months after implant; another patient developed a left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> over the device 21.6 months after implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients had intraprocedural gap and discontinued <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy after the 45-day evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incomplete LAA occlusion with a gap between the WATCHMAN device surface and the LAA wall is relatively common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural gaps are more likely to become bigger over time and persist, while new gaps also occur during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to verify whether the presence and persistence of a peridevice gap is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic event in AF patients implanted with a WATCHMAN device </plain></SENT>
