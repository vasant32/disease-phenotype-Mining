<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the two parameters of the heart sounds with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were higher than those with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and there was significant difference between these two kinds of heart sounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>That is probably due to the irregularity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> which causes the decrease of predictability, and it's more complex than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart sound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the correlation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent can be used to analyze the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and for its feature extraction </plain></SENT>
