<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on PWD and the prognostic implications of the improvement in PWD remain undefined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to explore the clinical significance of the improvement of PWD after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electrocardiographic studies were performed before and three months after CRT in 81 patients (57 men and 24 women; age (60.5 ± 11.2) years) with standard CRT indication but no history of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement of PWD (PWD responder) was defined as a relative decrease ≥ 20% from baseline PWD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints were new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF detected by electrocardiogram (ECG) or CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After (30.6 ± 7.5) months of follow-up, PWD responders (n = 43) had a significantly lower incidence of AF than did PWD nonresponders, 12% vs. 29% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Cox proportional hazard analysis, PWD responders was the only predictor of lower risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF (HR 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.12 - 0.96, P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Improvement of P-wave dispersion after CRT was associated with a lower incidence of AF, which may be related to the significant improvement in left ventricular systolic function and the reverse modeling of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
