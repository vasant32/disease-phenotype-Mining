<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty Japanese white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups (n=10 in each): control group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (a selective β1 receptor blocker) group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> (a nonselective β blocker/α-1 blocker) group and adriamycin group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Models of adriamycin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were established by intravenously injecting adriamycin <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) to rabbits via the auri-edge vein twice a week for 8 weeks in the adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rabbits in the control group were given equal volume of saline through the auri-edge vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbits in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> groups were then intragastrically administrated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg/d) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg/d) respectively for 2 months, while those in the adriamycin and control groups were treated with equal volume of saline in the same manner as in the metroprolol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP), malondialdehyde (MAD) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left ventricular wedge preparations were perfused with Tyrode's solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transmural electrocardiogram, transmural action potentials from epicardium (Epi) and endocardium (Endo), transmural repolarization dispersion (TDR) were recorded, and the incidences of triggered activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were obtained at rapid cycle lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results showed that TDR and the serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NT-proBNP levels were increased, and LVEF and the serum SOD level decreased in the adriamycin group compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidences of triggered activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were significantly higher in the adriamycin group than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> group as compared with the adriamycin group, the serum SOD level and the LVEF were substantially increased; the TDR, and the serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and NT-proBNP levels were significantly decreased; the incidences of triggered activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were obviously reduced (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and SOD, LVEF, TDR and the incidences of triggered activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> between the adriamycin group and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> may inhibit triggered activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rabbit with adriamycin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, which is related to the decrease in oxygen free radials </plain></SENT>
