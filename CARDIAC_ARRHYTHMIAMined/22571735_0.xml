<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablations are traditionally performed using fluoroscopic guidance, exposing both patients and medical staff to the risks of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonfluoroscopic catheter ablation has been used successfully to treat limited types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in children, but whether this approach has broad application in adults is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of fluoroless catheter ablation in adults being treated for a range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis was performed in 2 patient groups (both n = 60): (1) the nonfluoroscopy (NF) group consisting of consecutive adult patients, in which catheter positioning was accomplished exclusively with intracardiac electrograms (IE), electroanatomic mapping (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e>), and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE); and (2) the fluoroscopy (F) group, in which catheter positioning was additionally guided by fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients in the F group were selected to match the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the NF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ablation procedures were performed by one operator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total procedure time did not differ between groups for any specific type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> procedural success was similar in both groups (NF, 59/60 [98%] and F, 60/60 [100%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complications were limited to a groin pseudoaneurysm in the NF group, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the F group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Catheter ablations were efficiently and effectively performed in adults with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> using only IE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EAM</z:e>, and ICE for catheter guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This nonfluoroscopic technique was feasible, posed no additional safety concerns, and should be readily implementable in most electrophysiology laboratories </plain></SENT>
