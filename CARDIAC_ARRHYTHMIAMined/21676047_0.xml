<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coronary arterial injury continues to be a limitation of epicardial catheter ablation using currently available energy sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Application of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy may avoid such injury due to its theoretical ability to focus energy beyond the ablation element and create lesions at depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety of HIFU applications delivered directly over the left anterior descending (LAD) artery in an open-chest swine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten swine underwent median sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A prototype HIFU probe was placed atop the LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-three therapies along the LAD (60-seconds/6 watt) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three, 3, and 4 swine were studied at 2, 4, and 8 weeks and subsequently sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions were scored (0-4) depending on the percent circumferential involvement of arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesion area increased minimally from 54.5 ± 18.0 mm(2) at 2 weeks to 56.9 ± 20.6 mm(2) at 8 weeks, and depth increased moderately from 13.2 ± 2.5 mm to 15.5 ± 3.4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, the mean injury score of the LAD was 0.8 ± 0.3, 1.5 ± 0.9, and 2.0 ± 0.7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No/minimal arterial injury was seen in 64% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a progressive increase in injury resulted in 89% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sections showing any injury at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One animal developed occlusion of the distal LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HIFU has the potential to create deep ventricular lesions with relative sparing of the LAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incremental arterial damage noted over time warrants further evaluation to support the viability of focusing ultrasound energy beyond vulnerable critical structures to ablate deeper targets </plain></SENT>
