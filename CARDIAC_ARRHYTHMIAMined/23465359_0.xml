<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It includes a wide array of components that can have potential implication on health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed publications on the impact of coffee on a series of health outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Articles published between January 1990 and December 2012 were selected after crossing coffee or <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> with a list of keywords representative of the most relevant health areas potentially affected by coffee intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">Caffeine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16112">chlorogenic acids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35190">diterpenes</z:chebi> are important components of coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tolerance often acts as a modulator of the biological actions of coffee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a significant impact of coffee on the cardiovascular system, and on the metabolism of carbohydrates and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous beliefs, the various forms of arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018801" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart insufficiency</z:e> seem unaffected by coffee intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coffee is associated with a reduction in the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Protection seems to exist also for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, while its potential as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> risk factor is under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk depends on the tissue concerned, although it appears to favor risk reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coffee consumption seems to reduce mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The information gathered in recent years has generated a new concept of coffee, one which does not match the common belief that coffee is mostly harmful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This view is further supported by the discovery of a series of phyto-components with a beneficial profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reasonable optimism needs to be tempered, however, by the insufficiency of the clinical data, which in most cases stem from observational studies </plain></SENT>
