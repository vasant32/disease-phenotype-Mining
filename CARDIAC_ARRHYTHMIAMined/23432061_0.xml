<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of cardiac TRP channels is likely connected to the alteration of membrane potential or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> entry into a noncontractile compartment, where gene expression responsible for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> is induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review highlights some aspects of TRP channels with anticipated roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that (a) increased activities of TRPC1, TRPC3, or TRPC6 are involved in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, where these TRPC channels act as unique sensors for a wide range of hypertrophic stimuli, and (b) mutations in TRPM4 are now recognized as causes of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac conduction disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, TRP channels may become novel pharmacological targets in the treatment of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
