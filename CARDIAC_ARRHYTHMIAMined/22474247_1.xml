<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), cardiac metabolic substrate preference changes from fatty acid (FA) toward <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This change may cause progression toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that a diet rich in FAs may prevent this process, and that dietary ω3-FAs have an added antiarrhythmic effect based on action potential (AP) shortening in animals with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rabbits were fed a diet containing 1.25% (w/w) high oleic sunflower oil (HF-ω9, N=11), 1.25% fish oil (HF-ω3, N=11), or no supplement (HF-control, N=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, HF was induced by volume and pressure overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 4 months, HF-parameters were assessed, electrocardiograms were recorded, and blood and ventricular tissue were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Myocytes were isolated for patch clamp or intracellular Ca(2+)- recordings to study electrophysiologic remodeling and arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both the HF-ω9 and the HF-ω3 groups had larger myocardial FA oxidation capacity than HF control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HF-ω3 group had significantly lower mean (± <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) relative heart and lung weight (3.3±0.13 and 3.2±0.12 g kg(-1), respectively) than HF control (4.8±0.30 and 4.5±0.23), and shorter QTc intervals (167±2.6 versus 182±6.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The HF-ω9 also displayed a significantly reduced relative heart weight (3.6±0.26), but had similar QTc (179±4.3) compared with HF control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AP duration in the HF-ω3 group was ≈20% shorter due to increased I(to1) and I(K1) and triggered activity, and Ca(2+)-aftertransients were less than in the HF-ω9 group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dietary unsaturated FAs started prior to induction of HF prevent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, fish oil FAs prevent HF-induced electrophysiologic remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
