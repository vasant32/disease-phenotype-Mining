<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are at higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks and mortality compared to patients without atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a subanalysis of the PREPARE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Details of the PREPARE study design and results have been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now included 537 of the 700 patients enrolled in PREPARE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients had a dual or biventricular device and at least one device follow-up after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Continuously collected device diagnostics data were used to classify patients into two groups during follow-up: with (n = 133) or without (n = 404) atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AT/AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcomes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects were followed for a mean of 333 ± 73 (range 5-365) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 1 year, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks occurred in 44 (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly, more patients with AT/AF received a shock (13.0% vs 6.9%, P = 0.03), with inappropriate shocks accounting for the majority of the difference (6.9% vs 2.6%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in prevalence of shocks between patients with and without a history of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was similar in patients with and without AT/AF, whether detected during the study or prior to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 34 subjects with high average ventricular rate (≥110 beats per minute) during AT/AF had a higher risk of an inappropriate shock (21.0% vs 2.1%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients with AT/AF are more likely to receive shocks, especially inappropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mortality was not higher in AT/AF patients </plain></SENT>
