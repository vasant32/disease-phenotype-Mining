<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATP-sensitive K current (IKATP) activation suppresses EADs, but the effects on ICa,L-mediated reentry are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of IKATP activation on ICa,L-mediated reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed optical voltage mapping in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers exposed to BayK8644 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of pharmacologically activating IKATP with pinacidil were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 13 monolayers with anatomic ICa,L-mediated reentry around a central obstacle, pinacidil (50 Î¼M) converted ICa,L-mediated reentry to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>-mediated reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 33 monolayers with functional ICa,L-mediated reentry (spiral waves), pinacidil terminated reentry in 17, converted reentry into more complex <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>-mediated reentry resembling <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> in 12, and had no effect in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In simulated 2-dimensional bi-excitable tissue in which ICa,L- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>-mediated wave fronts coexisted, slow IKATP activation (over minutes) reliably terminated rotors but rapid IKATP activation (over seconds) often converted ICa,L-mediated reentry to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>-mediated reentry resembling <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IKATP activation can have proarrhythmic effects on EAD-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> if ICa,L-mediated reentry is present </plain></SENT>
