<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac injury caused by myocardial eosinophilic infiltration and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in CSS seems to be very common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Active inflammatory process accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> has been described in this population even despite disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, little is known about the possible myocardial repolarisation abnormalities in CSS which may lead to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate myocardial repolarisation in CSS patients at the time of initial diagnosis and during the last disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: In 20 CSS patients (8 male, 12 female) QT dispersion (QTd) and QTc dispersion (QTcd) calculated from heart rate corrected QT (QTc) from the surface 12-lead electrocardiograms were measured at the time of initial diagnosis and during the last disease remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a control group, 20 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CSS patients at remission and in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QTcd was higher in CSS (n = 20) than in healthy controls (n = 20) in each period of time: at the time of initial diagnosis (45.4 ± 14.2 vs 26.1 ± 6.5, p &lt; 0.0001) and at the remission (38.6 ± 13.4 vs 26.1 ± 6.5, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time of initial diagnosis in CSS patients with heart involvement (n = 13), when compared to patients without heart involvement, (n = 7), both QTcd (52.2 ± 12.1 vs 34.7 ± 10.7, p = 0.007) and QTd (37.7 ± 12.7 vs 24 ± 11.4, p = 0.008) were higher, and this difference remained significant at remission only for QTcd (46.7 ± 13.2 vs 33.1 ± 10.8, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was observed between QTcd/QTd and disease activity (measured using the Birmingham <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> Activity Score - BVAS), eosinophil blood count, presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34507">ANCA</z:chebi>, nor the duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most pronounced increased QTcd was detected in the CSS patients with cardiac involvement at the time of initial diagnosis and remained higher at remission in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CSS patients when compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in the CSS patients, QTcd remains within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, which may explain the relatively small number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
