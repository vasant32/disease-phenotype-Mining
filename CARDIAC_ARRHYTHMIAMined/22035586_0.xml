<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a 6-year retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of SK and TIMI risk score for MVA attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, SK-modified TIMI risk score was created by incorporating SK information into the usual score; the accuracy of new score was compared with that of the usual TIMI risk score by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 468 patients enrolled, the incidence of MVA 24 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> was 9.4%, and it was higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> group compared with that of the normokalemic group (27.3% vs 7.5%, P &lt; .001; odds ratio, 4.594; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.159-9.774) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant predictive value of SK was indicated by AUC of 0.787 (95% CI, 0.747-0.823, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> remained a predictor of MVA after being adjusted by the variables in TIMI risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AUC of TIMI risk score in relation to MVA was 0.586 (95% CI, 0.54-0.631; P = .0676) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of SK into TIMI risk score improved its predictive value for MVA attack (AUC = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.568-0.753; P &lt; .001), with significant difference between AUC of the new score and that of the original risk score (Z = 2.474, P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> on admission to the emergency department may be used as a valuable predictor and could add predictive information to some extent to TIMI risk score for MVA attack during 24-hour post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
