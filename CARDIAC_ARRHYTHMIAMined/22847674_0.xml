<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical, Sylmar, CA) show an increased incidence of insulation defects, particularly "inside-out" lead fracture where inner, separately insulated cables penetrate through the surrounding <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> of the lead body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exact incidence of Riata® lead problems is not clear and seems to range between 2-4% per year in the first 5 years after implantation according to new registry data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recommend beyond a detailed information the following care of patients with Riata® and Riata ST® leads: 1) Activation of automatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> alerts, 2) remote monitoring with automatic daily alerts whenever possible, 3) monthly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> controls in patients at high risk (pacemaker dependency, history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias) and high or moderate lead-related risk (8F, 7F single coil), 3-monthly controls in moderate patient and lead-related risk, 3 to 6-monthly controls in low patient and lead-related risk (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, no history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Every <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> control should include meticulous analysis of oversensing artifacts in stored electrograms (EGMs) of sustained and non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and registration of EGMs during provocation testing (pectoral muscle activity, arm movements) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If electrical abnormalities are observed, reoperation with addition of a new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> lead is recommended; lead extraction only if indicated according to current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy should only be performed if electrical abnormalities are found by an experienced electrophysiologist and a high frame rate and resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Management of fluoroscopic abnormalities in the absence of electrical abnormalities is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, routine fluoroscopy of patients with Riata® leads without electrical abnormalities is not recommended </plain></SENT>
