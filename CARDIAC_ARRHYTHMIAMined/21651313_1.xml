<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (lignocaine) as an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> in neonates originated more than 40 years ago in Scandinavia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> has been shown to be an effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> for the treatment of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that persist in spite of first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> toxicity, mainly in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, can be life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful to prevent toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, a dosing regimen was developed for term neonates, but it was not evaluated for preterm neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extrapolation of the previously developed dosing regimen to premature neonates without accounting for differences in pharmacokinetics because of immaturity of phase I metabolism and body fat/water ratio may result in serious toxicity or therapy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to develop an optimized dosing regimen for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in preterm as well as term neonates, using population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The requirements for this dosing regimen were simplicity of implementation, equal initial doses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> weight categories and avoidance of plasma concentrations &gt;9 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> administration, blood samples were collected from an arterial line from a total of 46 preterm and term neonates with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e>, within 10 days after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> concentrations were measured in plasma using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Population pharmacokinetic modelling started with assessment of two important aspects of paediatric pharmacokinetics: relation to body size and the effects of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the studied neonatal population (term and preterm neonates with gestational ages up to 10 days), gestational age and bodyweight were closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effects of allometry and maturation on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics could not be described independently and were described by a combined power estimate of bodyweight on clearance and volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on this pharmacokinetic model, a dosing strategy for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> for neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control was developed, which allows rapid and safe administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When prospective validation confirms our model, routinely performed therapeutic drug monitoring should no longer be necessary and would only be advised in cases of (suspected) clinical symptoms of over- or underdosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> dosing regimen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control in preterm and term neonates has been developed using population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Allometry and maturation exponents were combined into one exponent for each pharmacokinetic parameter and could not be described independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Based on this model, this regimen allows rapid and safe administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in this population </plain></SENT>
