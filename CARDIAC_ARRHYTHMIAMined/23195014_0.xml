<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available comparing the cardiovascular profile between KTRs from living versus deceased donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in the first 2 months following transplantation, among 120 KTRs of living versus deceased donor organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was observed in 65% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> in 30%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was more prevalent among KTRs from deceased versus living donors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001714'>ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> 87% versus 59% (P = .008); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001717'>coronary artery calcification</z:hpo> 42% versus 24% (P = .04); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> 59% versus 39% (P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and dialysis vintage, showed graft donor to not be associated with the prevalence of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (Î² coefficient 0.912, 95% confidence interval 0.276-3.012, P = .88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an elevated prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> among KTRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, mainly longer length on dialysis seemed to contribute to a greater prevalence of cardiovascular complications among KTRs from deceased compared with living donors on univariate but not multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
