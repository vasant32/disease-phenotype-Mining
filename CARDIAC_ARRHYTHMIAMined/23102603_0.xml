<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the efficacy of additional linear lesion and defragmentation of left atrium (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 169 patients with persistent AF was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed following a sequential strategy consisted of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI), LA roof linear ablation, posterior mitral area, coronary sinus and cavotricuspid isthmus, and complex fractionated electrograms ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 15±8months after a single procedure, 84 (50%) patients were in sinus rhythm, 34 (20%) had an AF recurrence and 51(30%) developed atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> (ATs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat procedures were performed in 24 recurrent AF and 46 AT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 81 different ATs were mapped and ablated in 46 AT patients, characterized as focal for 45 and macroreentry for 36 ATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the ATs were likely to be attributed to the previous lesions by an analysis of substrate and activation mapping in the redo procedure and a review of the lesions placed in the initial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 75 (93%) ATs were ablated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications occurred in 11 of the 239 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 20±9months, 128 (76%) patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after the final procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CPVI supplemented by linear ablation and defragmentation does not seem to improve the overall success rate of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of linear ablation and defragmentation might be diluted by their proarrhythmic effects </plain></SENT>
