<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) episodes and the total AF burden, may be related to the efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated (pre)-procedural factors explaining the long-term outcome after PVI, using a ring-shaped multielectrode ablation catheter [pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 120 consecutive patients with PAF were treated with the PVAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' histories were obtained by a questionnaire and the clinical charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with serial electrocardiogram, and multiple day Holter at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as event recording in case of unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, 66 of 120 (55%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [46-63%]) patients were free of any left atrial (LA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> without class I or III anti-arrhythmics after a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, freedom from LA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> slightly declined further to 58 of 119 (49%, 95% CI [40-58%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only pre-procedural predictor of long-term success was a shorter duration of the longest episode of AF (hazard ratio (HR) 0.77 95% CI [0.64-0.92]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only procedural predictor of long-term success was no need for direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for AF (HR 0.36 95% CI [0.21-0.61]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since other characteristics in these PAF patients were very homogeneous, no further clinical predictors were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Freedom from LA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after PVI for PAF with PVAC is 49% after 2-year follow-up, with little decline between year 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Predictors of long-term failure were a longer duration of the longest episode of AF in the pre-procedural questionnaire, and a procedural DCCV for AF </plain></SENT>
