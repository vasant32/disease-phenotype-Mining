<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Current guidelines suggest that the use of a mechanical prosthesis is favored when patients are already receiving long-term anticoagulation for conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical AF ablation can restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR) and obviate the need for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to determine the impact of concomitant AF ablation in patients with AF undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) on the restoration of NSR and subsequent requirement for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2004 and December 2009, a total of 124 patients (mean age 74 +/- 12 years) with pre-existing AF underwent AVR with or without coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The documented preoperative rhythm was long-standing persistent AF in 39 patients (32%), persistent AF in five (4%), and paroxysmal AF in 80 (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients (65%) had concomitant surgical AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ablation group, bilateral pulmonary vein isolation was performed in 55 cases (69%), left atrial-maze in 15 (19%), and Cox-maze in 10 (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A left atrial appendage closure was performed in 70 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm, in addition to anti-arrhythmic and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use, were assessed between three and 15 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 13 patients died and 18 were lost to follow up during the three- to 15-month window; consequently, 71 patients were available for analysis in the ablation group, and 22 in the non-ablation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 4% (the Ambler score predicted a median (IQR) of 6 (4-9)%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Freedom from AF when not receiving anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) occurred in 58 patients (82%) in the ablation group, compared to eight (36%) in the non-ablation group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients (70%) were free from <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in the ablation group, compared to six (27%) in the non-ablation group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No differences were identified in freedom from AF between the surgical AF lesion sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AF ablation, younger age, and paroxysmal AF were independently associated with freedom from AF when not receiving AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical AF ablation is associated with an improved restoration of NSR in patients with AF requiring AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The need for anticoagulation is reduced in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A bioprosthetic valve may be an acceptable option for a patient with AF who requires AVR </plain></SENT>
