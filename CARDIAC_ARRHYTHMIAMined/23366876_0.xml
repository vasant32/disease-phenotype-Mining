<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG signals consist of several segments with different <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp> (namely the P wave, QRS complex and the T wave) in a single heart beat, which can vary across individuals and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, existing statistical ECG models exhibit a reliance upon obtaining a priori information from the ECG data by using preprocessing algorithms to initialize the filter parameters, or to define the user-specified model parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we propose an ECG modeling technique using the sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) filter that can perform simultaneous model selection, by adaptively choosing from different representations depending upon the nature of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to track various types of ECG <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphologies</z:mp>, including intermittently occurring ECG beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we use the estimated model parameters as the feature set to classify between ECG signals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm and four different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
