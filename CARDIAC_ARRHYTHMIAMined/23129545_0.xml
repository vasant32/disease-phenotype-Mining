<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the validity of the discharge diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in administrative registers and reviewed the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> after workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two samples were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One sample consisted of 5262 randomly selected medical patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other sample consisted of 750 patients admitted or seen in the emergency department (ED) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10: R55.9) in three hospitals in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> charts were reviewed for baseline characteristics and to confirm the presence/absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and to compare with the administrative coding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a sample of 600 admitted patients 570 (95%) and of 150 patients from ED 140 (93%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> representing the positive predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median age of the population was 69 years (IQR: Â±14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the second sample of 5262 randomly selected medical patients, 75 (1.4%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, of which 47 were coded as R55.9 yielding a sensitivity of 62.7%, a negative predictive value of 99.5%, and a specificity of 99.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ED and hospital discharge diagnostic coding for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> has a positive predictive value of 95% and a sensitivity of 63% </plain></SENT>
