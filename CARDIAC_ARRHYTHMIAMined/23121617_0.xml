<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nicorandil (a K(ATP) opener) administration is reported to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> 4.8 ± 2.2 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological changes and the effects on dynamic factors and dynamically induced spatially discordant alternans by nicorandil during phase-2 MI are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Simultaneous voltage and intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(i)) optical mapping was performed in nine Langendorff-perfused hearts 4-5 hours after coronary artery ligation and nine control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Action potential duration (APD) restitution was constructed and arrhythmogenic alternans was induced by dynamic pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot studies (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) were performed in six more hearts for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil (100 μM) was administered after baseline studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phase-2 MI hearts showed longer APD, slower conduction velocity (CV), and higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) inducibility than the control hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil shortened and restored APD without significant arrhythmogenic effects, and also increased the rate of Ca(i) reuptake and flattened CV restitution to suppress spatially discordant alternans, which might account for a tendency toward higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> threshold with nicorandil infusion in phase-2 MI hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting studies showed significant down-regulation of K(ATP) protein expression, which was functionally correlated to the blunted APD shortening response to nicorandil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: K(ATP) expression is down-regulated in phase-2 MI hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil restores APD, increases the rate of Ca(i) reuptake, and flattens CV restitution to suppress spatially discordant alternans induction, which ameliorates its proarrhythmic effects during phase-2 MI </plain></SENT>
