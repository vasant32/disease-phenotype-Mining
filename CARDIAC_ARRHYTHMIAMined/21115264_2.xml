<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), neurodegenerative changes have been observed in autonomic pathways involving multiple organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explore pupillary and cardiac autonomic measures as physiological manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pupil measures (pupillary unrest (spontaneous changes of pupil diameter in darkness), constriction velocity and redilation velocity) were assessed in 35 participants (17 PD, 18 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous cardiac measures (respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing, Valsalva ratio, resting heart rate variability (HRV), orthostatic change in blood pressure and orthostatic change in heart rate) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonparametric statistics were used to compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> with control participants and to calculate correlation coefficients between pupillary and cardiac measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pupillary unrest and orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure were greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing and resting HRV were lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, there was a negative correlation between HRV and redilation velocity and a positive correlation between orthostatic change in heart rate and pupillary unrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A modifying effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> was found on the association between high frequency HRV and pupillary unrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in both pupillary and cardiac systems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlations between pupillary and cardiac measures suggest shared central centers of autonomic integration, while the modifying effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> may reflect autonomic effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-related pathology not present in controls </plain></SENT>
