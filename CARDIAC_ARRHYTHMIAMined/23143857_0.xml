<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet, HM introduction to routine clinical practice is challenged by resource allocation for regular HM data review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the feasibility, safety, workload, and clinical usefulness of a centralized HM model consisting of one monitor centre and nine satellite clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Having no knowledge about patients' clinical data, a telemonitoring nurse (TN) and a supporting physician at the monitor centre screened and filtered HM data in 62 pacemaker and 59 ICD patients from nine satellite clinics for over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic screening of arrhythmic and technical events required 25.7 min (TN) and 0.7 min (physician) per working day, normalized for 100 patients monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Communication of relevant events to satellite clinics per email or phone required additional 4.3 min (TN) and 0.4 min (physician) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Telemonitoring nurse also screened for abnormal developments in longitudinal data trends weekly for 3 months after implantation, and then monthly; one patient session lasted 4.0 Â± 2.9 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To handle transmission-gap notifications, TN needed additional 2.8 min daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Satellite clinics received 231.3 observations from the monitor centre per 100 patients/year, which prompted 86.3 patient contacts or intensive HM screening periods by the satellite clinic itself (37.3% response rate), 51.7 extra follow-up controls (22.3%), and 30.1 clinical interventions (13.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Centralized HM was feasible, reliable, safe, and clinically useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basic screening and communication of relevant arrhythmic and technical events required a total of 30 min (TN) and 1.1 min (physician) daily per 100 patients monitored </plain></SENT>
