<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Wenxin Keli (WK), a Chinese herb extract, is reported to be effective in the treatment of atrial and ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that WK inhibits the transient outward current (Ito) OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the effectiveness of WK, alone and in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, to suppress arrhythmogenesis in an experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential and ECG recordings were obtained from epicardial and endocardial sites of coronary-perfused canine right ventricular wedge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ito <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> NS5806 (10-15 μM) was used to pharmacologically mimic a genetic predisposition to BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ito <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> induced Phase 2 reentry (P2R) in 13/19 preparations and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (pVT) in 11/19 wedge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WK (10g/L) suppressed P2R and pVT in 100% (3/3) of preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lower concentration of WK (5g/L) suppressed P2R in 60% (3/5) and pVT in 50% (2/4), but in combination with a low concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> (5 μM) was 100% effective in suppressing P2R and pVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi> alone suppressed P2R and pVT in 60% (3/5) and 50% (2/4), respectively and in combination with WK (5g/L) suppressed P2R and pVT by 80% (4/5) and 75% (3/4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>WK reduced Ito, ICa and contractility in single cardiomyocytes, but dose-dependently increased contractility in intact wedge preparations, an effect mimicked by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15760">tyramine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide support for the hypothesis that Wenxin Keli, particularly in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, effectively suppresses arrhythmogenesis in an experimental model of BrS via inhibition of Ito and indirect adrenergic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
