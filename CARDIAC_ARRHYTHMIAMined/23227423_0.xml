<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AF is correlated with an increased morbidity and mortality, mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular imaging modalities, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), play a central role in the workup and treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the major advantages of CMR is the high contrast to noise ratio combined with good spatial and temporal resolution, without any radiation burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This allows a detailed assessment of the structure and function of the left atrium (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the ability to visualize the extent of LA wall injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We provide a focused review of the value of CMR in identifying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AF, its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention and in the guidance of radiofrequency catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMR is a promising technique that could add valuable information for therapeutic decision making in specific subpopulations with AF </plain></SENT>
