<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of the present study is to estimate the procedure (implantation) cost, the total hospitalization cost and annual follow-up cost, in patients subjected to pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A single-center, prospective, cost-of-illness study was conducted between August 2008 and July 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 464 consecutive patients were recruited (370 were subjected to PM implantation and 94 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resource data were assessed at patients' enrolment in the study and at 6th and 12th months of patients' follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, the procedure cost, the total hospitalization cost as well as the annual patients' follow up costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (95% confidence interval) procedure cost of PM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation (including the costs of devices, electrodes, other supplies, and personnel's time) was calculated to be €1803 (€1758-€1858) and €13,521 (€13,153-€13,892), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean total hospitalization cost (including procedure cost, hospitalization cost, cost of laboratory and imaging diagnostic examinations and the indirect cost attributed to productivity lost due to patient's hospitalization) was €3926 (€3711-€4167) for PM and €17,764 (€16,852-€18,692) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean annual cost (direct and indirect) was €1816 (€1433-€2421) for PM and €2819 (€2115-€3703) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected in the annual cost between patients with initial implantation and replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data revealed that although these devices are associated with a relatively high upfront cost, the annual societal cost following the implantation is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, implantation of such devices should be encouraged since these devices reduce the morbidity and mortality without a high economic burden to society </plain></SENT>
