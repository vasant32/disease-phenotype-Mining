<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of AF in these subjects is challenging, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is often refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is usually avoided or delayed in patients with MVR due to the higher perceived risks and difficulty of left atrial catheter manipulation in the presence of a mechanical valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last few years, several investigators have reported the feasibility and safety of RFCA of AF in patients with MVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five case-control studies have evaluated the feasibility and safety of RFCA of AF or perimitral flutter (PMFL) in patients with MVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, a total of 178 patients with MVR have been included (21 undergoing ablation of only PMFL), and have been compared with a matched control group of 285 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total procedural duration (weigthed mean difference [WMD] = +24.5 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] +10.2 min to +38.8 min, P = 0.001), and fluoroscopy time (WMD = +13.5 min, 95% CI +3.7 min to +23.4 min, P = 0.007) were longer in the MVR group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 11.5 Â± 8.6 months, 64 (36%) patients in the MVR group experienced recurrence of AF/PMFL, as compared to 73 (26%) patients in the control group, accounting for a trend toward an increased rate of recurrences in patients with MVR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.66, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.78, P = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural complications occurred in 10 (5.6%) patients in the MVR group, and in 8 (2.8%) patients in the control group (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 0.56 to 7.15, P = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a quantitative analysis of the available evidence supports a trend toward a worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival and a higher absolute rate of periprocedural complications in patients with MVR undergoing RFCA of AF or PMFL, as compared to a matched control group without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264765,C0026265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mitral valve disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data would encourage the adoption of RFCA of AF in MVR patients mostly by more experienced Institutions </plain></SENT>
