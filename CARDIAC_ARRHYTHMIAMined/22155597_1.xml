<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize variations in SCN1Bb associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) and sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> known exons and intron borders of the BrS-susceptibility genes were amplified and sequenced in both directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild type</z:mp> (WT) and mutant genes were expressed in TSA201 cells and studied using co-immunoprecipitation and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient 1 was a 44-year-old man with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi>-induced type 1 ST-segment elevation in V1 and V2 supporting the diagnosis of BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 was a 62-year-old woman displaying a coved-type BrS electrocardiogram who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 was a 4-month-old female <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A R214Q variant was detected in exon 3A of SCN1Bb (Na(v)1B) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three probands, but not in any other gene previously associated with BrS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R214Q was identified in 4 of 807 ethnically-matched healthy controls (0.50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of SCN5A/WT + SCN1Bb/R214Q resulted in peak <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel current (I(Na)) 56.5% smaller compared to SCN5A/WT + SCN1Bb/WT (n = 11-12, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Co-expression of KCND3/WT + SCN1Bb/R214Q induced a Kv4.3 current (transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current, I(to)) 70.6% greater compared with KCND3/WT + SCN1Bb/WT (n = 10-11, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation indicated structural association between Na(v)β1B and Na(v)1.5 and K(v)4.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that R214Q variation in SCN1Bb is a functional polymorphism that may serve as a modifier of the substrate responsible for BrS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> phenotypes via a combined loss of function of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel current and gain of function of transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
