<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> is catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>), which is a highly lethal form of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study focuses on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> form of the disease caused by the missense mutation D307H in the cardiac calsequestrin gene, CASQ2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because CASQ2 is a key player in excitation contraction coupling, the derangements in intracellular Ca(2+) handling may cause delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), which constitute the mechanism underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the CASQ2 mutated cells, we generated for the first time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming fibroblasts from skin biopsies of two patients, and demonstrated that the iPSCs carry the CASQ2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Next, iPSCs were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSCs-CMs), which expressed the mutant CASQ2 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major findings were that the Î²-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> caused in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> iPSCs-CMs (but not in the control cardiomyocytes) DADs, oscillatory arrhythmic prepotentials, after-contractions and diastolic [Ca(2+) ](i) rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy analysis revealed that compared with control iPSCs-CMs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> iPSCs-CMs displayed a more immature phenotype with less organized myofibrils, enlarged sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae and reduced number of caveolae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results demonstrate that the patient-specific mutated cardiomyocytes can be used to study the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
