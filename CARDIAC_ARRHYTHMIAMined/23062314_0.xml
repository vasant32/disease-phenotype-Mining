<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its prognostic significance in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected patients remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spatial QRS-T angle was derived from the baseline resting 12-lead electrocardiogram of 4,453 HIV-infected patients aged 43.5 ± 9.3 years from the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events were identified during a median follow-up of 28.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quartiles of the spatial QRS-T angle was calculated for men and women separately, and values in the upper quartile were considered as a widened angle (values &gt;74° for women and &gt;93° for men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the association between a widened baseline spatial QRS-T angle and incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 11,965 person-years of follow-up, 152 CVD events occurred at a rate of 1.27 events/100 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events in those with a widened spatial QRS-T angle was almost double the rate in those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spatial QRS-T angle (rate ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.69; p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a model adjusted for study treatment arm, demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors, HIV characteristics, inflammatory markers, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>, a widened spatial QRS-T angle was associated with a &gt;50% increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> events compared to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spatial QRS-T angle (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.17; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This highlights the potential role of routine electrocardiography as a simple noninvasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk-screening tool in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
