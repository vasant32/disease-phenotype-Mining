<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were divided into 4 groups (n = 30) randomly: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (n = 6), saline group (control group, n = 8), BMSCs transplantation group (BMSCs group, n = 8) and SERCA2a gene modified BMSCs transplantation group (BMSCs + rAd.SERCA2a group, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 14 days, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and heart electrical activity was evaluated by electrocardiogram and microelectrode array (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The transduction ratio of rAd.SERCA2a to BMSCs were 80% to 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Left ventricular ejection fraction on 14 days after therapy was significantly higher in BMSCs group and BMSCs + rAd.SERCA2a group than in control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) QT duration was significantly shorter [(80.30 ± 6.53) ms vs. (105.31 ± 21.89) ms, P &lt; 0.05] and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> less frequent in BMSCs + rAd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SERCA2a group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> results suggested that isolated heart beat was significantly slowed down and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> were recorded in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum field potential and field potential duration on infarcted myocardium area in BMSCs group and BMSCs + rAd.SERCA2a group were significantly longer than those in control group[the maximum field potential: (0.51 ± 0.15), (0.55 ± 0.16), (0.23 ± 0.10) mV; field potential duration: (104.5 ± 25.43), (107.67 ± 24.01), (63.00 ± 20.34) ms; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(5) The conduction time was the shortest and the cardiac electrical conduction consistency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> tissue was significantly improved in BMSCs + rAd.SERCA2a group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs and SERCA2a gene modified BMSCs transplantation could significantly improve cardiac function and BMSCs + rAd.SERCA2a could also effectively improve electrical conduction of infarcted myocardium and attenuate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
