<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:e> (WPW), therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> could become challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to review the authors' experience of performing electrophysiologic study (EPS) with or without ablation to determine how it affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent EPS between 2002 and 2009 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients under 21 years of age who had prior diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 12.1 ± 2.7 years (range: 5.6-16.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> on average 3.9 ± 2.7 years (range: 6 months-9 years) prior to the EPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had cardiac symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients underwent ablation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrate (16/17, 94% successful) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients with asymptomatic WPW were at low risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and did not have ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After the EPS, two patients had increased doses of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> medications, and two patients whose health-care providers stopped the stimulant medication prior to EPS because of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> were restarted on medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> medications continued therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EPS for risk stratification and ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrate is safe and effective, allowing more liberal therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or WPW </plain></SENT>
