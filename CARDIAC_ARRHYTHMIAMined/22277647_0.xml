<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine whether prognostic information can be derived from the size and location of Q-waves in persons from the general population without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of 5381 persons without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> or HF from the 4th Copenhagen City Heart Study were reviewed and Q-waves were classified according to their size and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the associations of Q-waves adjusted for age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and estimated glomerular filtration rate with the risk of the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and hospitalization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a median of 7.8 years of follow-up, 1003 persons reached the combined endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fourteen (2.1%) had pathological Q-waves, of whom 44% suffered from an event compared with 18% from the control group, P&lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> were more likely to have Q-waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even small Q-waves (i.e. Minnesota code 1.2.x-1.3.x) were associated with a poor prognosis, hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-2.0; P&lt; 0.05], though not as grave as large Q-waves (i.e. Minnesota code 1.1.x) HR 2.8 (95%CI: 1.6-5.0; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there was no difference in the outcome of patients with anteriorly HR 1.6 (95%CI: 1.1-2.4) vs. posteriorly HR 1.5 (95%CI: 0.9-2.4) located Q-waves (P= 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the general population without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> or HF, even small Q-waves in the ECG are associated with a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
