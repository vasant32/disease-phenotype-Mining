<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to identify risk factors for MACCE in a broad surgical population with intermediate-to-high surgery-specific risk and to build and validate a model to predict the risk of MACCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, multicentre study of patients undergoing surgical procedures under general or regional anaesthesia in 23 hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome was the occurrence of at least one perioperative MACCE, defined as any of the following complications from admittance to discharge: cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MACCE predictive index was based on Î²-coefficients and validated in an external data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3387 patients recruited, 146 (4.3%) developed at least one MACCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regression model identified seven independent risk factors for MACCE: history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp>, intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 75.9% (95% confidence interval, 71.2-80.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk score based on seven objective and easily assessed factors can accurately predict MACCE occurrence after non-cardiac surgery in a population at intermediate-to-high surgery-specific risk </plain></SENT>
