<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Destabilization of sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> could be beneficial by affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> complexity (defined by the number of rotors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, underlying mechanisms affecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> stability are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to correlate changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> complexity with changes in specific electrophysiological parameters, allowing a search for novel factors and underlying mechanisms affecting stability of sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte monolayers and Langendorff-perfused adult rat hearts were exposed to increasing dosages of the gap junctional uncoupler 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="22908">borate</z:chebi> (2-APB) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ion channel blockers/openers were added to study effects on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological parameters were assessed by optical mapping and patch-clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> complexity in cardiomyocyte cultures increased with increasing dosages of 2-APB (n &gt; 38), leading to sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>: 0.0 ± 0.1 phase singularities/cm(2) in controls vs. 0.0 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.9, 3.3 ± 3.2, 11.0 ± 10.1, and 54.3 ± 21.7 in 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 µmol/L 2-APB, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> complexity inversely correlated with wavelength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lengthening of wavelength during <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> could only be induced by agents (BaCl(2)/BayK8644) increasing the action potential duration (APD) at maximal activation frequencies (minimal APD); 123 ± 32%/117 ± 24% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Minimal APD prolongation led to transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> destabilization, shown by critical wavefront collision leading to rotor termination, followed by significant decreases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> complexity and activation frequency (52%/37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These key findings were reproduced ex vivo in rat hearts (n = 6 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that stability of sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> is regulated by minimal APD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Minimal APD prolongation leads to transient destabilization of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, ultimately decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> complexity, thereby providing novel insights into anti-fibrillatory mechanisms </plain></SENT>
