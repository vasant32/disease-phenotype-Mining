<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown association of genetic variants with AF and that familial AF increases the risk of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown a substantial heritability of AF in a twin study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether having a co-twin with AF influences mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish twins with AF born during and after 1912 in the Danish Twin Registry, the National Patient Registry, and the Central Office of Civil Registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each twin, we randomly identified 4 twins without AF, matched on sex, zygosity, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared survival among the co-twins of the affected twins (co-cases, n=2164) and the co-twins of the unaffected twins (co-controls, n=8626) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The co-cases showed increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates compared with the co-controls (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.30; P&lt;0.0001), and this effect was more pronounced in monozygotic twins (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.55; P=0.003), compared with dizygotic same sex (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.29; P=0.006) and opposite sex twins (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.47; P=0.093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate was 20% higher in twins who had a co-twin with AF than in twins without familial AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect was almost doubled in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins, suggesting the influence of genetic factors </plain></SENT>
