<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the outcome of transatrial-transpulmonary repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> in relation to a right-ventricular outflow tract (RVOT)-sparing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on the surgical management of right-ventricular outflow tract obstruction (<z:mp ids='MP_0010449'>RVOTO</z:mp>) at repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>, 140 children were retrospectively divided into three groups: (1) pulmonary valve (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>)-sparing, (2) infundibulum-sparing and (3) extended trans-annular patch (TAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic outcome was assessed with regards to three equally divided study time eras between January 1994 and June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 15-year study period, median age decreased from 11 (2-101) to 5 (1-11) months (p&lt;0.001), whereas type of RVOT repair changed significantly between the first and the last era (group 1: 18-40%, group 2: 25-40% vs group 3: 57-20% (p=0.002)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications were mainly related to clinical restrictive RV <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> (27%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cardiac morbidity remained constant over the eras and was associated with younger age (p=0.04), increased postoperative right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) pressure ratio (p=0.01) and type of RVOT repair at the cost of TAP (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up of 8 years (1-16 years) showed an overall freedom from RVOT re-operation of 84% and 73%, respectively at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most re-operations were for residual/recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0010449'>RVOTO</z:mp> (12%) occurring more frequently in the latter era: 16% versus 7% in era 1 (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late echocardiographic evaluation revealed a strong correlation between severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> and increased RV/LV size ratio, which was mainly determined by increased TAP length (p&lt;0.001) and duration of follow-up (p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a 15-year's experience with transatrial-transpulmonary correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>, a valve- and infundibulum-sparing approach has been advanced by lowering the age for elective repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This change has been performed without compromising immediate clinical outcome, despite an increased early re-operation rate for residual obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, longer follow-up will disclose whether this approach is protective against progressive and late RV dysfunction </plain></SENT>
