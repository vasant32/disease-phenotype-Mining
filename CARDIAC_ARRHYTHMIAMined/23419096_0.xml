<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation has been established as a curative treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard procedure of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the right ventricle is performed via the femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a femoral vein access may not achieve a successful ablation in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a case of a 29-year old patient with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> was referred for catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency energy application at the earliest endocardial ventricular activation site via the right femoral vein could not eliminate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epicardial mapping could not obtain an earlier ventricular activation when compared to the endocardial mapping, and at the earliest epicardial site could not provide an identical pace mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we redeployed the ablation catheter via the right subclavian vein by a long sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During mapping of the subvalvular area of the right ventricle, a site with a good pace mapping and early ventricular activation was found, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> were eliminated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the subtricuspid annulus may be successfully abolished via a trans-subclavian approach and a long sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although access via the right subclavian vein for mapping and ablation is an effective alternative, it is not a routine approach </plain></SENT>
