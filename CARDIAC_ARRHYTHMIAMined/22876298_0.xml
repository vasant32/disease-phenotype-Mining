<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (Na(v)1.5) controls cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, SCN5A mutations that result in loss-of-function of Na(v)1.5 are associated with various inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes that revolve around reduced cardiac excitability, most notably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have indicated that Na(v)1.5 interacts with the cytoskeleton and may also be involved in maintaining structural integrity of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether clinical evidence may be obtained that Na(v)1.5 is involved in maintaining cardiac structural integrity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, we compared right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) dimensions and ejection fractions between 40 BrS patients with SCN5A mutations (SCN5a-mut-positive) and 98 BrS patients without SCN5A mutations (SCN5a-mut-negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied 18 age/sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SCN5a-mut-positive patients had significantly larger end-diastolic and end-systolic RV and LV volumes, and lower LV ejection fractions, than SCN5a-mut-negative patients or volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function SCN5A mutations are associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and impairment in contractile function of both ventricles that can be detected by CMR analysis </plain></SENT>
