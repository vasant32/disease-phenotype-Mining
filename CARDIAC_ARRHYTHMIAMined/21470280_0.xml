<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alterations in the ECG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> (CD) are predictable from risk factor analysis alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In 79 patients with a diagnosis of CD, retrospectively recruited, ECG features [corrected for heart rate QT (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTcd), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (ECG-LVH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001667'>right ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (ECG-RVH)], systolic (SBP) and diastolic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) blood pressure were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biochemical, hormonal (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> at 09·00 h or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> day curve, CDC) and carbohydrate abnormalities (CHA), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison reasons, a group of 42 healthy subjects matched for gender, age and body mass index previously subjected to ECG assessment were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with CD, we noted the following prevalence: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> 39%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> 81%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> 21·5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> 37%, hypertriglyceridaemia 29%, CHA 41%, but a history of cardiac dysrhythmia was only noted in a single patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference in QTc or QTcd was shown between patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or low <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QTcd &gt;50 ms was associated with both increased ECG-LVH and ECG-RVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared to the control group, patients had longer QTcd (P &lt; 0·001), more prevalent LVH (P &lt; 0·001) and RVH (P = 0·001), and higher SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0·001), but similar QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both CD and ECG evidence of LVH predicted prolonged QTcd, but the association of CD with a prolonged QTcd was independent of other risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged QTcd in association with ECG evidence of LVH appears to be the specific feature of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may be relevant in the choice of medical therapy for CD and for consideration of treatment of the comorbidities that are associated with hypercortisolaemia </plain></SENT>
