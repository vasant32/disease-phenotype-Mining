<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of sinus arrest caused by SN <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> following RCA stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old woman with a significant history of RCA stenosis with prior bare metal stenting, presented to the emergency department with anginal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial work up showed significant elevation of cardiac troponin T with T-wave inversion in the inferior leads on electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of midportion of the RCA, mild occlusion in the left anterior descending coronary and left circumflex coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenting was performed on the RCA lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediately after undergoing those interventions, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> developed and occluded SN artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram showed junctional escape rhythm without P waves at a heart rate of 30 beats per minute, suggesting sinus arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clot in the SN artery was identified and thrombectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither symptoms nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were identified during this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six days later, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm began to appear on EKG with improving heart rate, and patient still remained completely hemodynamically stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-discharge exercise stress test had shown 50% predicted heart rate without ST segment change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sinus node dysfunction is commonly related to degenerative processes, and rarely caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the SN artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our case, we emphasize the potential complication of sinus arrest after RCA stent implantation </plain></SENT>
