<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study aims to investigate how heterocellular coupling between cardiomyocytes (CMCs) and myofibroblasts (MFBs) affects arrhythmogeneity of fibrotic myocardial cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potentially, this may lead to the identification of novel anti-arrhythmic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Co-cultures of neonatal rat CMCs and MFBs in a 1:1 ratio were used as a model of <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp>, with purified CMC cultures as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmogeneity was studied at day 9 of culture by voltage-sensitive dye mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterocellular coupling was reduced by transducing MFBs with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA targeting connexin43 (Cx43) or luciferase (pLuc) as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fibrotic cultures, conduction velocity (CV) was lowered (11.2 ± 1.6 cm/s vs. 23.9 ± 2.1 cm/s; P &lt; 0.0001), while action potential duration and ectopic activity were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximal diastolic membrane potential (MDP) of CMCs was less negative in fibrotic cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fibrotic cultures, (n = 30) 30.0% showed spontaneous re-entrant tachyarrhythmias compared with 5% in controls (n = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cx43 silencing in MFBs made the MDP in CMCs more negative, increased excitability and CV by 51% (P &lt; 0.001), and reduced action potential duration and ectopic activity (P &lt; 0.01), thereby reducing re-entry incidence by 40% compared with pLuc-silenced controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-arrhythmic effects of Cx43 down-regulation in MFBs was reversed by depolarization of CMCs through I(k1) inhibition or increasing extracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arrhythmogeneity of fibrotic myocardial cultures is mediated by Cx43 expression in MFBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of Cx43 causes a more negative MDP of CMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This preserves CMC excitability, limits prolongation of repolarization and thereby strongly reduces the incidence of spontaneous re-entrant tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
