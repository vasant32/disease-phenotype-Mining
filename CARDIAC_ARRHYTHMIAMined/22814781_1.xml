<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess whether renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN) can be achieved using an off-the-shelf saline-irrigated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter typically employed for cardiac tissue ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: RSDN using a specialized solid-tip RFA catheter has recently been demonstrated to safely reduce systemic blood pressure in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For cardiac tissue ablation, RFA technology has evolved from nonirrigated to saline-irrigated ablation electrodes to improve both safety and effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> underwent renal angiography, followed by bilateral RSDN with a saline-irrigated RFA catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressure recordings (24 h) were obtained at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat renal angiography was performed during follow-up to assess for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, pre- and post-procedural serum measures of renal function and sympathetic activity were obtained: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>; metanephrine; normetanephrine; plasma renin activity; and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 6-month period: 1) the systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by -21/-11 mm Hg; 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients experienced a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg (range 10 to 40 mm Hg); 3) there was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at repeat angiography; and 4) there was a significant decrease in metanephrine (-12 ± 4, p = 0.003), normetanephrine (-18 ± 4, p = 0.0008), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> levels (-60 ± 33 ng/l, p = 0.02) at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in plasma renin activity (-0.2 mg/l/hod, p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (-1 mmol/l, p = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the proof-of-principle that RSDN can be performed using an off-the-shelf saline-irrigated RFA catheter </plain></SENT>
