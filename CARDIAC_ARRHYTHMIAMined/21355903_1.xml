<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To estimate risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> maintenance treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is evidence that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> prolongs the QT interval, and has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> treatment, occurring in a cohort with a defined exposure to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We obtained consent to access coronial records to investigate these in-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in detail, to identify potential cases of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>--those cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> occurred without clear evidence of an alternate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained consent to access clinic records of dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two physicians reviewed the coronial files and circumstances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of person-years exposure to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> treatment was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were extensive missing data in coronial and clinic files, making definitive assessment difficult in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No definite case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> seemed possible, and 10 cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study covered 14,500 patient-years (pys) in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> treatment, yielding an estimate from 0 to 0.069 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 100 pys, with a best estimate of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurring at a rate of 0.014 per 100 pys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overdose is a more common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and overdoses were associated with use of other drugs in addition to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi>â€”usually, prescription drugs or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> maintenance patients appears to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The major risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was use of prescription drugs, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6809">methamphetamine</z:chebi>, in addition to <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
