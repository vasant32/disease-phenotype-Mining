<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Based on a porcine model with surgically created <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) as a pre-clinical scheme, this study investigates the clinical translation of cell sheet fragments of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cellular cardiomyoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSC sheet fragments retaining endogenous extracellular matrices are fabricated using a thermo-responsive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> hydrogel system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic observations indicate that transplantation of MSC sheet fragments in infarcted hearts can markedly attenuate the adverse ventricular dilation and preserve the cardiac function <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post MI</z:e>, which is in contrast to the controlled groups receiving saline or dissociated MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, histological analyses suggest that administering MSC sheet fragments significantly prevents the scar expansion and left ventricle remodeling after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry results demonstrate that the engrafted MSCs can differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, implying that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and the subsequent regional perfusion improvement is a promising mechanism for ameliorating post-infarcted cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, according to the data recorded by an implantable loop recorder, the transplanted MSCs may provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the proposed approach may potentially lead to the eventual translation of MSC-based therapy into practical and effective clinical treatments </plain></SENT>
