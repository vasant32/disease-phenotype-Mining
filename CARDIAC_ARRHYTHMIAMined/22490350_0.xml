<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of 38 patients aged 80 years or greater receiving isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from September 2001 to November 2010 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 33 male and 5 female patients, aging from 80 to 87 years with a mean of (82.6 ± 1.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients underwent conventional (on-pump) CABG and 26 patients underwent off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of bypass grafts was 1 to 5 (mean 2.5 ± 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left internal mammary artery was used in 37 (97.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 2.6% (1/38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infection</z:hpo> (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay lasted (3.8 ± 1.4) days and (15 ± 6) days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Totally 38 patients were followed up for 4 to 70 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 92.6% patients recovered without any cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated CABG can be performed safely with acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Appropriate surgical strategy and intensive perioperative treatment must be enhanced in octogenarians who underwent CABG </plain></SENT>
