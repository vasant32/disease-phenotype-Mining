<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a condition with low incidence and prevalence, diagnosed through imaging techniques such as Doppler echocardiogram (DE), multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, it may be asymptomatic or manifested by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a report on a 33 year old asymptomatic man who suffered a blow on his chest (commotio cordis) during a sports competition that produced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011841'>ventricular flutter</z:hpo> that required electrical defibrillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A DE obtained initially, did not show any significant abnormality, but another DE, a MSCT and a RMN obtained after discharge, certified isolated non-compacted myocardium, ruling out <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He received beta blocker and antiplatelet therapy and the placement of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of the association of these two infrequent and potentially lethal conditions is discussed </plain></SENT>
