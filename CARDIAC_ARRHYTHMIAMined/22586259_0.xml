<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a prospectively triggered, high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, we aim to determine the radiation dose and image quality in patients undergoing pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 94 patients (61±9 years; 71% male) who underwent 128-slice dual-source CT (pitch 3.4), radiation dose and image quality were assessed and compared between 69 patients with sinus rhythm and 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiation dose was compared in a subset of 19 patients with prior retrospective or prospectively triggered CT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> scans without high pitch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 18 patients with prior magnetic resonance imaging for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> assessment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and scan duration were compared with high-pitch CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the high-pitch protocol, total effective radiation dose was 1.4 (1.3, 1.9) mSv, with no difference between sinus rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (1.4 versus 1.5 mSv; P=0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No high-pitch CT scans were nondiagnostic or had poor image quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiation dose was reduced with high-pitch (1.6 mSv) compared with standard protocols (19.3 mSv; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This radiation dose reduction was seen with sinus rhythm (1.5 versus 16.7 mSv; P&lt;0.0001) but was more profound with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (1.9 versus 27.7 mSv; P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was excellent agreement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (κ 0.84; P&lt;0.0001) and a shorter CT scan duration (6 minutes) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (41 minutes; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> imaging can be performed with minimal radiation dose, short scan acquisition, and excellent image quality in patients with sinus rhythm or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This protocol highlights the success of new cardiac CT technology to minimize radiation exposure, giving clinicians a new low-dose imaging alternative to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
