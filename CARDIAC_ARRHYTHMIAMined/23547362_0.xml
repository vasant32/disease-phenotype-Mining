<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, particularly in patients with an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, sexual activity may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> which may be sometimes serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a physiological point of view, sexual activity produces increased sympathetic activity and thereby probably reduced vagal tone which at different degrees may induce cardiac arrythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several presently available autopsy-studies have shown that this happens very rarely and that it mostly affects men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, recently published recommendations allow us to better advise patients with cardiac arrhytmias to engage in sexual activity or to defer it until the condition is stabilized and optimally controlled </plain></SENT>
