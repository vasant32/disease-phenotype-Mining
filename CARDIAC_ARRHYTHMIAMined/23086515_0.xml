<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: An understanding of epicardial pacing is essential for the postoperative management of patients having cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By developing a software-based epicardial pacing program to be used with the existing patient simulator, resident physicians may be exposed to various clinical scenarios that might be encountered while caring for a postoperative heart patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This experience will assist junior residents with no prior experience to become familiar and competent in the management of epicardial pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The simulation session used the human patient simulator in combination with an internally developed computer program using Flash animation to present <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and various epicardial pacing interventions commonly used in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By modeling the Flash animation software after a pulse generator, the user is able to make adjustments (type of pacing, rate of pacing, and chamber output) as if using an actual pulse generator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of 15 anesthesiology residents who had minimal or no epicardial pacing experience underwent the simulation training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Feedback was obtained by an anonymous postscenario questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A detailed description of the scenario and computer program is provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants provided positive feedback and have strongly agreed that the simulation session improved their understanding and management of epicardial pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with epicardial pacing simulation was demonstrated to be effective in increasing the confidence of junior anesthesiology residents with little or no prior experience with regard to the management of temporary pacemakers </plain></SENT>
