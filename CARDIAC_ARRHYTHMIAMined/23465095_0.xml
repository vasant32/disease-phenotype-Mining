<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That some patients manifest life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in the absence of substantial myocardial replacement suggests that gap junction remodeling might be acting synergistically to ventricular remodeling to promote arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we sought to verify gap junction composition and distribution by analyzing the expression and occurrence of specific gap junction proteins (connexins [Cxs]) in patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens were taken from 16 patients with definite ARVC (age 48 ± 16 years) and analyzed for Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> expression (relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi>-dehydrogenase messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> expression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (n = 6; age 32 ± 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with ARVC showed a significant reduction in the messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> expression of Cx40 (p &lt;0.0001) and Cx45 (p &lt;0.0001) compared to that of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of Cx43 was similar in patients with ARVC and controls (p = 0.098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in plakophilin-2 were identified in 7 of 16 patients (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Cx expression levels were comparable between the mutation carriers and noncarriers (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ARVC features alterations in the expression of Cxs and their distribution at cardiac intercalated discs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apart from the deposition of extracellular matrix, the potential loss of gap junctions and shift in the composition of gap junctional Cxs in the ventricular conduction system might further contribute to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
