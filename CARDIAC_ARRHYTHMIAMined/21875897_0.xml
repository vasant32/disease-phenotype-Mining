<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> modulation of female hormones, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>, on cardiac repolarization and the susceptibility to d,l-sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, were studied in female rabbits by ovariectomy and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) through recording and analyzing of electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The corrected QT interval (QTc) measured 2 weeks after ovariectomy was not significantly different from that in the time-matched control rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks of HRT, the QTc in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> alone (group E) was not significantly different from that in the control (group C); whereas in the ovariectomized rabbits treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (group E + P), it was significantly shorter than those in groups E (P &lt; .05) and C (P &lt; .01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The corrected Tpeak-end interval (Tpec), an indicator of global dispersion of ventricular repolarization, was also significantly reduced in group E + P compared with that of group C (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group E, d,l-sotalol-induced prolongation of QTc and the rate and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly higher, while the dose of sotalol to initiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly lower than those in groups C or E + P, respectively (P &lt; .05 or P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">Estradiol</z:chebi> potentiates QTc prolonging effects of d,l-sotalol and increases the susceptibility to d,l-sotalol-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> without significantly altering QTc itself, whereas <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> may accelerate the process of repolarization and protect the females from drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, thus counteracting the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
