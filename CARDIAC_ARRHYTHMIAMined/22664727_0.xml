<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Berbamine, a natural compound from Barberry, was reported to protect myocardium from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Berbamine pretreatment from 10 to 100nmol/L concentration-dependently improved post-ischemic myocardial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar protection was confirmed in isolated cardiomyocytes characterized by the attenuation of I/R-induced intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) overloading and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of cell shortening and Ca(2+) transients, which were partially mimicked but not augmented by calpain inhibitor calpeptin and abolished by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (mitoK(ATP) channel inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistently, I/R-induced increase of calpain activity and decrease of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2) activity; and protein expression of SERCA2a, desmin, calpastatin and Akt was significantly attenuated by berbamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, I/R-decreased Akt protein was reversed by calpeptin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, berbamine further increased I/R-enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These protections were abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, berbamine significantly attenuated I/R-induced <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and contractile dysfunction, and such cardioprotective actions were abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and 5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> or mimicked by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inhibitor SB216763 but without additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that berbamine confers cardioprotection against I/R injury by attenuating [Ca(2+)inf(i) overloading and preventing calpain activation through the activation of the PI3K-Akt-GSK3β pathway and, subsequently, opening of the mitoK(ATP) channel </plain></SENT>
