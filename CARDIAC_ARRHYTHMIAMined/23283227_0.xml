<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracellular resistivity is a linear sum of that offered by gap junctions between contiguous cells and the cytoplasm of the myocytes themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relative contribution of the two components is unclear, especially in atrial myocardium, as there are no precise measurements of cytoplasmic resistivity, R(c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, R(c) was measured in atrial tissue using several methods: a dielectrophoresis technique with isolated cells and impedance measurements with both isolated cells and multicellular preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> methods yielded similar values for R(c), with a mean of 138 ± 5 Ω·cm at 23°C, and a Q(10) value of 1.20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This value is about half that of total intracellular resistivity and thus will be a significant determinant of the actual value of action potential conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dielectrophoresis experiments demonstrated the importance of including divalent cations (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) in the suspension medium, as their omission reduced cell integrity by lowering membrane resistivity and increasing cytoplasm resistivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurate measurement of R(c) is essential to develop quantitative computational models that determine the key factors contributing to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
