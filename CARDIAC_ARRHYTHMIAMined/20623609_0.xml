<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to explore the anti-arrhythmic mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> in diabetic rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty rats were divided into four groups: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> group (MI); (3) Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> group (T2DM+MI); and (4) Type 2 diabetic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi>-treated group (BBR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg/day) was administered after coronary artery ligation in the T2DM+MI group for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot was performed for quantification of target proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were aggravated in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores in the MI group were significantly higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> at a dose of 60 mg/kg/d recovered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RMP (Resting membrane potential) which could be recovered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05), was significantly reduced in both the infarction groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>I(K1) current and current density markedly decreased in the MI and T2DM+MI groups (P &lt; 0.05) and could be reversed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relative expression of Kir2.1 in rats in the MI and T2DM+MI group were both significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> recovered depressed Kir2.1 to nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> on I(K1)/Kir2.1 may be an important mechanism for producing anti-arrhythmic effects </plain></SENT>
