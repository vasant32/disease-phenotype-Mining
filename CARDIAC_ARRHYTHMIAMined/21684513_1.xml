<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical, implantation, and follow-up data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transvenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> at the Mayo Clinic from 1991 through 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> received 85 ICDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Implantation diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (44%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Implantation indication was occurrence of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (secondary prevention) in 36% and prophylactic (primary prevention) in the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no major implant-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (2.2 Â± 2.8 years, range 0 to 15) 11 patients died and 4 patients received heart or heart/lung transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An appropriate shock for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was observed in 19% of patients and an inappropriate shock was observed in 15% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likelihood of an appropriate shock was associated with increased subpulmonic ventricular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, implantation of transvenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> is associated with a low risk of implant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this high-risk adult population the rate of inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks is low, whereas the likelihood of appropriate therapy for potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest overall benefit of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
