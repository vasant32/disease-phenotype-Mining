<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in electroanatomic mapping technologies resulted in a decrease and even in elimination of fluoroscopy exposure during these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electrophysiological procedures were performed with the use EnSite NavX™ or Velocity™ (St </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following construction of the right atrial geometry, other relevant geometries were formed (right ventricle, coronary sinus, or left atrium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy was used in patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, in younger children, and during transseptal punctures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cryoablation or radiofrequency was used for catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 305 patients underwent catheter ablation for various supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia substrates using EnSite system guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No fluoroscopy was used in 191 (63%) of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean fluoroscopy time in the rest of the procedures was 13.9 ± 11.6 minutes (0.2-60 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure time was 184 ± 71 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No complications were noted except for temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0006597'>diaphragmatic paralysis</z:hpo> in one patient and temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in another patient following cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success rate in achieving complete elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates was 95% (290/305) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate was (31/271) 11.4% at a mean follow-up time of 42 ± 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroscopy can be significantly decreased or even eliminated in the majority of catheter ablation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term results demonstrate that this can be done efficiently and safely </plain></SENT>
