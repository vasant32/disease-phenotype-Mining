<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of real-time integration of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) derived coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and epicardial fat distribution and its impact on electroanatomical mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epicardial catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) is an important therapeutic option in patients after endocardial ablation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, epicardial mapping and ablation are limited by the presence of coronary arteries and epicardial fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (21 male, age 59 ± 16 years) underwent combined endo-epicardial electroanatomical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to the procedure, MDCT derived coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and epicardial fat meshes were loaded into the mapping system (CARTO XP, Biosense Webster Inc, Diamond Bar, California) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time registration of MDCT data was performed after endocardial mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distance between epicardial ablation sites and coronary arteries was assessed by registered MDCT and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, mapping and ablation points were superimposed on the MDCT using a reversed registration matrix for head-to-head comparison of mapping data and corresponding fat thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Image registration was successful and accurate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (position error 2.8 ± 1.3 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At sites without evidence for scar, epicardial bipolar voltage decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) with increasing fat thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-six VA were targeted; 25 (54%) were abolished by catheter ablation, in 21 (46%) ablation failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 5 VA no target site was identified and in 3 VA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> prevented mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 2 VA ablation was withheld due to His-bundle vicinity and in 7 VA due to proximity of coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 4 VA catheter ablation was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At ineffective ablation sites epicardial fat was significantly thicker compared to successful sites (16.9 ± 6.8 mm [range 7.3 to 22.2 mm] and 1.5 ± 2.1 mm [range 0.0 to 6.1 mm], p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Real-time image integration of pre-acquired MDCT information is feasible and accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Epicardial fat &gt;7 mm and the presence of coronary arteries are important reasons for epicardial ablation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Visualization of fat thickness during the procedure may facilitate interpretation of bipolar electrograms and identification of ineffective ablation sites </plain></SENT>
