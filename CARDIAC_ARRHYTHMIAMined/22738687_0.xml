<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo> is a reversible cause of atrioventricular (AV) block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few reports have described reversible <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> are expected to have a benign course after the initiation of appropriate therapy for thyroid dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of patients with II or III degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> (≤40bpm) excluding patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, electrolyte abnormalities, digitalis toxicity, and vasovagal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thyroid dysfunction is diagnosed when thyroid stimulating hormone and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> levels are not in defined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> was determined by surface electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause and effect relation between <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and thyroid dysfunction was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 668 patients, 29 (4.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (19 overt) and 21 (3.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> (8 overt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent ECG finding was complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (27 of 50 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> and 13 had second-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Euthyroid state was achieved in 10 hypothyroidic (34%) and in 7 hyperthyroidic patients (33%) with hormone replacement and antithyroid therapy, respectively, during the follow-up period (≤21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thyroid dysfunction was found to be not related with <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in 40 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, in 4 of 10 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> related to thyroid dysfunction the resolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> occurred after the placement of pacemaker (&gt;21 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, 44 of 50 (88%) patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in association with thyroid dysfunction were implanted with a permanent pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of 6 patients who did not receive a pacemaker, 2 had complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and 4 had bradyarrythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> associated with thyroid dysfunction needs great attention regardless of type of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with II and/or III degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in the setting of thyroid dysfunction almost always need permanent pacemaker insertion even after normalization of thyroid status </plain></SENT>
