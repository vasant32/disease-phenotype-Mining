<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Blockade of inward-rectifier K+ channels by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> terminates reentry in cholinergic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether inward-rectifier K+ channels and reentry are also important in maintaining stretch-induced AF (SAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We surmised that reentry underlies SAF, and that abolishing reentry with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> terminates SAF more effectively than traditional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>-channel blockade by flecainide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty Langendorff-perfused sheep hearts were exposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and continuous atrial stretch, and mapped optically and electrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF dynamics were studied under control and during perfusion of either <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> (4 µmol/L, n=7) or flecainide (2-4 µmol/L, n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">Chloroquine</z:chebi> increased rotor core size and decreased reentry frequency from 10.6±0.7 Hz in control to 6.3±0.7 Hz (P&lt;0.005) just before restoring sinus rhythm (7/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flecainide had lesser effects on core size and reentry frequency than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> and did not restore sinus rhythm (0/5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific IKr blockade by E-4031 (n=7) did not terminate AF when frequency values were &gt;8 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During pacing (n=11), flecainide reversibly reduced conduction velocity (≈30% at cycle length 300, 250, and 200 ms; P&lt;0.05) to a larger extent than <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> (11% to 19%; cycle length, 300, 250, and 200 ms; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant action potential duration prolongation was demonstrable only for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi> at cycle length 300 (12%) and cycle length 250 ms (9%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">Chloroquine</z:chebi> is more effective than flecainide in terminating SAF in isolated sheep hearts by significantly increasing core size and decreasing reentry frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">Chloroquine</z:chebi>'s effectiveness may be explained by its inward-rectifier K+ channel blockade profile and suggest that reentry is important to maintain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> SAF </plain></SENT>
