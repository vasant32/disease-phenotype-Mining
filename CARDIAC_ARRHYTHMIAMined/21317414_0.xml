<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Tizanidine (Zanaflex) is a centrally acting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53094">imidazoline</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="51371">muscle relaxant</z:chebi> that is structurally similar to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> (α(2)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi>) but not to other myorelaxants such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and QT interval prolongation have been reported with tizanidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: To evaluate the effects of tizanidine on cardiac ventricular repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (1) Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments: HERG- or KCNQ1+KCNE1-transfected cells were exposed to tizanidine 0.1-100 µmol/L (n = 29 cells, total) to assess drug effect on the rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) components of the delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Langendorff retroperfusion experiments: isolated hearts from male Hartley guinea pigs (n = 6) were exposed to tizanidine 1 µmol/L to assess drug-induced prolongation of monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) In vivo wireless cardiac telemetry experiments: guinea pigs (n = 6) implanted with radio transmitters were injected a single intraperitoneal (ip) dose of tizanidine 0.25 mg/kg and 24 hours electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Patch-clamp experiments revealed an estimated IC(50) for tizanidine on I(Kr) above 100 µmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, tizanidine 1 µmol/L had hardly any effect on I(Ks) (5.23% ± 4.54% inhibition, n = 5 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(2) While pacing the hearts at stimulation cycle lengths of 200 or 250 ms, tizanidine 1 µmol/L prolonged MAPD(90) by 8.22 ± 2.03 (6.7%) and 11.70 ± 3.08 ms (8.5%), respectively (both P &lt; .05 vs baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) Tizanidine 0.25 mg/kg ip caused a maximal 11.93 ± 1.49 ms prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc), 90 minutes after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tizanidine prolongs the QT interval by blocking I(Kr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients could be at risk of cardiac proarrhythmia during impaired drug elimination, such as in case of CYP1A2 inhibition during drug interactions </plain></SENT>
