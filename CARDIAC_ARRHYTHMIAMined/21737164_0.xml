<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors predicting the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) after catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 186 patients (55.12 Â± 12.06 years, 123 male) including 161 paroxysmal AF and 25 non-paroxysmal AF who underwent catheter ablation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical datum before and during ablation were recorded, and systematic follow-up was conducted after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to determine the factors predicting late recurrence of AF (LRAF) which means AF recurrence after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 47(25.27%) patients who experienced LRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was carried out to the parameters that P&lt;0.10 in the univariate analysis, which includes overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MetS), AF categories, duration of AF history, left atrial diameter (LAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, ablation strategies, procedural failure and early recurrence of AF after ablation (ERAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the results demonstrated that overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (OR=4.71, 95% CI 1.71-12.98, P=0.003), MetS (OR=4.41, 95% CI 1.56-12.46, P=0.005), procedural failure (OR=58.34, 95% CI 6.83-498.34, P&lt;0.001), and ERAF (OR=3.18, 95% CI 1.07-9.44, P=0.037) were independent predictors of AF recurrence after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, procedural failure and ERAF are independent predictors of late recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
