<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with AF can function reasonably well on a daily basis with anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small proportion of patients with AF remain symptomatic despite anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They might have an indication for invasive treatment for AF, such as endovascular catheter ablation (effective particularly in paroxysmal AF) or the Cox-Maze procedure (open heart surgery), in which the conductivity between the pulmonary veins and the left atrium is blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hybrid thoracoscopic pulmonary vein isolation (VATS-PVI) is a new minimally invasive treatment for AF where the cardiothoracic surgeon and cardiologist work closely together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this procedure the cardiologist performs electrophysiological measurements to verify whether the blockade of conductivity is successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach has a success rate of 86% at a follow-up of 12 months </plain></SENT>
