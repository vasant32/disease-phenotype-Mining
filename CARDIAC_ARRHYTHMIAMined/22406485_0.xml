<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that CAD is the most common cause of SCD in adults, but the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> as a primary or contributing cause is less known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied the cardiac findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of adult SCD attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, or both, in the absence of specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Association between findings and risk factors was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 484 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo>, of which 402 met study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 49 ± 13 years, with 289 men and 159 African Americans (AAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>Cardiomegaly</z:hpo> with presumed hypertensive, multifactorial or unknown cause, was the sole arrhythmogenic substrate in 38% of men and 49% of women (p = 0.003); CAD was the sole cause of SCD in 19% of men and 26% of women, and mixed CAD + <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 43% of men and 25% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>Cardiomegaly</z:hpo> was associated by univariate analysis with younger age (46 ± 12 years versus 53 ± 14 for CAD, p &lt; 0.0001), AA race (p = 0.004), and body mass index (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with a mean age of about 50 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> is a frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and is highly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>Cardiomegaly</z:hpo> is also frequent in SCD with severe CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The causes and classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> in patients without specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, and in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> need to be better studied </plain></SENT>
