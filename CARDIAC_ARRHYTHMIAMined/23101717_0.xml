<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the past few years, the development of effective, empirical technologies for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> has exceeded the pace at which detailed knowledge of the underlying biology has accumulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, although some clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be cured with techniques such as catheter ablation, drug treatment and prediction of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> remain fairly primitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of key candidate genes for monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes shows that to bring basic biology to the clinic is a powerful approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasingly sophisticated experimental models and methods of measurement, including stem cell-based models of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, are being deployed to study how perturbations in several biologic pathways can result in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-prone heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is largely quantifiable, which allows for systematic analysis that could transform treatment strategies that are often still empirical into management based on molecular evidence </plain></SENT>
