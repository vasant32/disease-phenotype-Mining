<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore possible differential effects between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> and atenolol in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The study was randomized, double blind, two-way crossover with the Y1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> AR-H040922 given as IV infusion for 2 h or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> or atenolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a post hoc analysis we compared the hemodynamic response to exercise of the Y1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (n = 16) and atenolol (n = 5), and assessed respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), an indirect measurement of cardiac vagal activation, in the placebo phase in patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (n = 26) and on atenolol (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1) The Y1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> reduced the systolic blood pressure rise during and after exercise during atenolol, but not during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, while heart rate and maximal load were similar with the two beta-blockers and not affected by the Y1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) At equal heart- and respiration-rate 7-8 min after exercise the RSA was significantly lower in atenolol than in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> patients, while no difference was seen at rest before exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings from this hypothesis generating study indicate that peripheral effects of NPY contribute less to cardiovascular stress reactions in patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> than in those on atenolol </plain></SENT>
