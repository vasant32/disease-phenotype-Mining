<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Shilajit is a mineral-rich complex organic compound used in the traditional system of Ayurvedic medicine for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and improving the cardiac function with many herbomineral preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, very little experimental evidence is available about its effect on the cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Daphnia as a model organism for observing the effect of shilajit on its heart due to its myogenic properties and its response to number of cardioactive drugs that are known to affect human heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genome of Daphnia shows the strongest homology with the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These characteristics of Daphnia make it an ideal organism for biomedical research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that this complex organic compound lowers the heart beats as its concentration increases from 1.0 to 100 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The beats come to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition at 1000 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Above 1000 ppm, the beats are very fast and impossible to count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a negative chronotropic effect on the Daphnia heart at low concentrations and a positive chronotropic effect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and finally failure at increasing higher concentrations of shilajit </plain></SENT>
