<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal catheter tip-to-tissue contact force (CF) during lesion delivery is believed to reduce clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between catheter CF during irrigated catheter ablation for AF and clinical recurrences during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with paroxysmal AF underwent PVI by using a radiofrequency ablation catheter with a CF sensor integrated at its tip, and they were followed for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the CF and clinical outcomes was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> PVI was achieved in 100% of the veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent (351 of 1017) of the applications were placed with an average CF of &lt;10 g (low CF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with an average CF of &lt;10 g (5 of 5 patients) experienced recurrences, whereas 80% of the patients treated with an average CF of &gt;20 g (8 of 10 patients) were free from AF recurrence at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the average force-time integral showed that 75% of the patients treated with &lt;500 gs were recurrent whereas only 31% of the patients treated with &gt;1000 gs had recurrences at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CF during catheter ablation for AF correlates with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> control is best achieved when ablation lesions are placed with an average CF of &gt;20 g, and clinical failure is universally noted with an average CF of &lt;10 g </plain></SENT>
