<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks and the resultant psychobiological changes are known to contribute to increased levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and post-shock stress symptoms in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phantom shock is a patient-reported perception of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock in the absence of any actual shock; however, its pathophysiological understanding is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the University hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients' database from June 2006 to April 2010 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 patients with documented phantom shocks as cases and 76 age- and sex-matched patients with no phantom shocks as controls were selected from the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics were analyzed for their potential association with the occurrence of phantom shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Phantom shock patients had higher prevalence of documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (31.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (23.7%), and cocaine use (42.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients who had previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock storms were more likely to have phantom shocks (39.5%; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly, no phantom shocks were reported in patients who did not receive defibrillation threshold testing or past <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock storms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Phantom shocks are primarily observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients who had prior exposure to traumatic device shocks and are more common in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
