<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Respiratory modulation of autonomic input to the sinus node results in cyclical modulation of heart rate, known as respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the respiratory cycle may also exert cyclical modulation on ventricular repolarization, which may be separately measurable using local endocardial recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: The study included 16 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ventricles undergoing routine clinical electrophysiological procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unipolar electrograms were recorded from 10 right and 10 left ventricular endocardial sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breathing was voluntarily regulated at 5 fixed frequencies (6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 breaths per min) and heart rate was clamped by RV pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activation-recovery intervals (ARI: a surrogate for APD) exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.025) cyclical variation at the respiratory frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects; ARI shortened with inspiration and lengthened with expiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peak-to-peak ARI variation ranged from 0-26 ms; the spatial pattern varied with subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure also oscillated at the respiratory frequency (p &lt; 0.025) and lagged behind respiration by between 1.5 s and 0.65 s from slowest to fastest breathing rates respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic oscillation amplitude was significantly greater than diastolic (14 ± 5 vs. 8 ± 4 mm Hg ± SD, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Observations in humans with healthy ventricles using multiple left and right ventricular endocardial recordings showed that ARI action potential duration (APD) varied cyclically with respiration </plain></SENT>
