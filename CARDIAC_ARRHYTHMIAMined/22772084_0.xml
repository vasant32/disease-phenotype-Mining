<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Participants' home environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients with cardiopulmonary illnesses: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) (n=63), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (n=60), and patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (n=60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven ambulatory physical activity dimensions (total steps, percent time active, percent time ambulating at low, medium, and high intensity, maximum cadence for 30 continuous minutes, and peak performance) were measured with an accelerometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with COPD had the lowest amount of ambulatory physical activity compared with subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmias (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 activity dimensions, P&lt;.05); total step counts were: 5319 versus 7464 versus 9570, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-minute walk distance was correlated (r=.44-.65, P&lt;.01) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> physical activity dimensions in the COPD sample, the strongest correlations being with total steps and peak performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subjects with cardiac impairment, maximal oxygen consumption had only small to moderate correlations with 5 of the physical activity dimensions (r=.22-.40, P&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, correlations between 6-minute walk test distance and physical activity were higher (r=.48-.61, P&lt;.01) albeit in a smaller sample of only patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 samples, self-reported physical and mental health functioning, age, body mass index, airflow obstruction, and ejection fraction had either relatively small or nonsignificant correlations with physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 dimensions of ambulatory physical activity discriminated between subjects with COPD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and cardiac dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Depending on the research or clinical goal, use of 1 dimension, such as total steps, may be sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although physical activity had high correlations with performance on a 6-minute walk test relative to other variables, accelerometry-based physical activity monitoring provides unique, important information about real-world behavior in patients with cardiopulmonary illness not already captured with existing measures </plain></SENT>
