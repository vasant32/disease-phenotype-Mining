<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 7485 Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients from a global randomized controlled trial (CREATE) database were divided into six groups by admission HR: &lt; 60, 60 - 69, 70 - 79, 80 - 89, 90 - 99 and ≥ 100 bpm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; the secondary outcomes were the composite of 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock or deadly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Admission <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, proportion of female gender, incidence of anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and Killip level II-IV were significantly higher in patients with admission HR ≥ 90 bpm compared to 60 - 69 bpm group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality was lowest (6.3%) in the 60 - 69 bpm group and was 9.6% in HR &lt; 60 bpm group (P &lt; 0.05 vs. 60 - 69 bpm group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with admission HR &gt; 60 bpm, the 30-day mortality increased in proportion to higher admission HR: 8.1% in 70 - 79 bpm, 9.2% in 80 - 89 bpm, 12.6% in 90 - 99 bpm and 24.6% in ≥ 100 bpm groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05 vs. 60 - 69 bpm group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MACE was similar as that of 30-day mortality: 27.0% in &lt; 60 bpm, 12.5% in 60 - 69 bpm, 13.7% in 70 - 79 bpm, 14.3% in 80 - 89 bpm, 17.5% in 90 - 99 bpm and 31.1% in ≥ 100 bpm groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the incidence of 30-day mortality positively correlated with the admission HR (P &lt; 0.05) except in the patients with admission HR &lt; 60 bpm (OR = 0.832, P = 0.299), the risk of joint endpoint events was higher in the patients with HR &lt; 60 bpm (OR = 1.532, 95%CI: 1.201 - 1.954, P &lt; 0.05), 90 - 99 bpm (OR = 1.436, 95%CI: 1.091 - 1.889, P &lt; 0.05) or ≥ 100 bpm (OR = 1.893, 95%CI: 1.471 - 2.436, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Admission HR is an independent risk factor for short-term outcome in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
