<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcome of cardiac surgery in patients with a prior history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate in our unit the population of patients with a known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and compare their outcomes to a matched population without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent cardiac surgery at the Alfred Hospital between February 2002 and December 2009 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were matched to 216 controls based on age, gender, major medical comorbidities and type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A univariate analysis was performed with Fishers exact test and Ï‡(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 83/4474 patients were identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four (77%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was 66.7 years, and 67.4 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>68.7% had a solid organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, and 31.3% had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant between-group differences in hospital or 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, there were significantly higher rates of transfusion (79.5% vs 49%, p&lt;0.0001), reintubation (8.4% vs 0.9%, p=0.0009), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (14.5% vs 6%, p=0.035), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septicaemia</z:e> (8.4% vs 1.9%, p=0.018), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (42.2% vs. 33.8%, p=0.047) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> complications (7.2% vs 0%, p=0.008) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients who present for cardiac surgery having had prior treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are at particular risk for complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, these patients can be operated upon with acceptable risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is no difference in the short term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for selected patients who are undergoing curative treatment for their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, or are in remission, cardiac surgery is not contraindicated </plain></SENT>
