<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, when the exact location of the leads was documented by three-dimensional echocardiography, true septal RVOT position was achieved in only one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients, the leads were, in fact, implanted into the RVOT anterior free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram criteria were not able to identify the septal position from the anterior RVOT free wall position </plain></SENT>
