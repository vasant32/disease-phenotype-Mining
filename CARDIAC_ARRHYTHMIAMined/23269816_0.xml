<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fish oil (FO) has antiinflammatory effects, which might reduce systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> induced by a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We tested whether perioperative infusions of FO modify the cell membrane composition, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp>, and clinical course of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in cardiac surgery patients who received 3 infusions of 0.2 g/kg FO emulsion or saline (control) 12 and 2 h before and immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood samples (7 time points) and an atrial biopsy (during surgery) were obtained to assess the membrane incorporation of PUFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic data, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> requirements, and core temperatures were recorded at 10-min intervals; blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, nonesterified fatty acids, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, inflammatory cytokines, and carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were measured at selected time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients, with a mean ± SD age of 65.5 ± 9.9 y, were enrolled with no baseline differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in platelet <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> (+0.86%; P = 0.0001) and DHA (+0.87%; P = 0.019) were observed after FO consumption compared with at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atrial tissue <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> concentrations were higher after FO than after control treatments (+0.5%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FO did not significantly alter core temperature but decreased the postoperative rise in IL-6 (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> increased transiently after each FO infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and blood carboxyhemoglobin were lower in the FO than in the control group on the day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence was low with no significant difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No adverse effect of FO was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative FO infusions significantly increased PUFA concentrations in platelet and atrial tissue membranes within 12 h of the first FO administration and decreased biological and clinical signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that perioperative FO may be beneficial in elective cardiac surgery with CPB </plain></SENT>
