<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pool of 4 thorough QT studies were used, representing 99 healthy subjects who received moxifloxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were modeled using Monolix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics were ascribed a 2- compartment open model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The TRANSIT model provided a better description of the delay in absorption than did the LAG model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant covariate was lean body mass (LBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population estimates for clearance and central volume of distribution were 10.0 L/h per 60 kg of LBM and 131 L per 60 kg of LBM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of moxifloxacin on QT was investigated using a direct effect model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SLOPE model, relating the QT increase as a linear function of concentration, provided a better description of the pharmacodynamic effect than did the Emax model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The unique covariate was gender for both baseline QT and individual heart rate correction factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin were satisfactorily described by an open 2-compartmental model with linear elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The trigonometric equation with a direct and proportional concentration effect satisfactorily described the effect on QT </plain></SENT>
