<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between postoperative AAs and pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) resection has not previously been clearly elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study on this issue is reported.Methods A total of 125 patients were involved in this study and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the performed surgical procedures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> postoperative AAs were carefully reviewed and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to clarify the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection on postoperative AAs.Results The overall incidence of postoperative AAs was 14.4% (n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stepwise increase in the incidence of AAs was observed from none, to the inferior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection only, superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection only and up to both inferior and superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection (0, 3.1%, 14.3%, and 38.5%, respectively; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection was identified as an independent risk factor for postoperative AAs when it was entered either as an ordinal or as a categorical variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection revealed 0.786 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.685 to 0.887), which was significantly larger than the extent of pulmonary resection (0.724; 95% CI, 0.637 to 0.800; p = 0.015).Conclusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> resection plays an important role in the development of postoperative AAs after pulmonary resection and could be used as a good predictor for postoperative AAs </plain></SENT>
