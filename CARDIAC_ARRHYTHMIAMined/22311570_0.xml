<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extracardiac anomalies were noted in 14 (37%) of 38 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>Cardiac defects</z:mpath> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001651'>dextrocardia</z:hpo> in 26%, partially or totally <z:hpo ids='HP_0010772'>anomalous pulmonary venous return</z:hpo> in 29%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011565'>common atrium</z:hpo> in 50%, atrioventriculoseptal defect in 73%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> in 40%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventriculoseptal defect</z:hpo> without atrioventricular defect in 11%, transposition in 21%, double outlet of the right ventricle in 26%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> or atresia in 61%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular outflow obstruction</z:e> in 24% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were presented in 71% and pacemaker treatment in 29% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 38 patients, 33 had cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Simple palliative methods were used in 11 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> palliation in 12 cases, and operation with a biventricular track in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the groups that had surgery, 3 of 11 patients, 3 of 12 patients, and 3 of 10 patients died, respectively </plain></SENT>
