<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The false tendons (FTs) are fibromuscular bands that transverse the left ventricular cavity and often contain conduction tissue, suggesting that FTs may contribute to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of J waves is associated with vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>; however, the mechanisms underlying the manifestation of J waves remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the electrocardiographic characteristics, including the presence of J waves, in patients with FTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 44 patients with distinct FTs detected by echocardiography (FT group) and 88 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects without FTs (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PQ, QRS, JT, QT, corrected JT, and corrected QT intervals were automatically measured on surface 12-lead electrocardiograms, and the presence or absence of J waves was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>J waves were defined as terminal QRS notching or slurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FTs were classified according to their points of attachment as type 1 (longitudinal, 52%), type 2 (diagonal, 25%), type 3 (transverse, 16%), and type 4 (weblike, 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QRS and corrected QT intervals were significantly longer in the FT group than in the control group (P &lt;.005 and P &lt;.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of J waves was significantly higher in the FT group (64%) than in the control group (19%) (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>J waves were more prevalent in type 1 (78%) and type 2 (73%) than in type 3 (14%) and 4 FTs (33%) (P &lt;0.05) and in patients with thick FTs (â‰¥ 2 mm) than with thinner FTs (&lt;2 mm) (71% vs 33%; P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The J-wave location differed according to the FT type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FTs may carry a certain role to the genesis of J waves </plain></SENT>
