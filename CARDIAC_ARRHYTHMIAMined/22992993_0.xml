<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography is currently the only alternative to invasive angiography in the evaluation of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients referred for valvular or thoracic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> surgery, invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard required by cardiac surgeons during the preoperative evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines, evaluation of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> is recommended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients above 40 years of age, with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), in postmenopausal women, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with suspected ischaemic aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo>, and in patients with one or more risk factors for CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The possibility to perform coronary CT angiography to exclude CAD before planned non-coronary cardiac surgery was first allowed in the 2010 Report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation Task Force on Expert Consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the usefulness of dual-source CT for the evaluation of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in patients before planned cardiac valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 98 consecutive patients with a haemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> and guideline-based indications for coronary angiography to exclude CAD before planned valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, frequent ventricular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature beats</z:e>), estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> contrast agents, and lack of patient consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age was 58.8 (range 30-78) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) was first determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coronary CT angiography was not performed if CACS was &gt; 1000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients, complete CT evaluation was performed with the administration of a contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conventional invasive coronary angiography was subsequently performed in patients with at least one &gt; 50% stenosis, artifacts due to calcifications, or motion artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 79 (80.6%) patients, CT angiography excluded the presence of a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005145'>coronary artery stenosis</z:hpo> without the need for invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conventional coronary angiography was required in 19 (19.4%) patients, including 13 (13.3%) patients with a &gt; 50% stenosis in CT angiography, 2 (2%) patients with calcification artifacts, 1 (1%) patient with motion artifacts, 2 (2%) patients with CACS &gt; 1000 in whom CT angiography was nor performed, and 1 (1%) patient with allergic symptoms during administration of a test dose of the contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, significant CAD was diagnosed in 9 (9.2%) patients in whom coronary artery bypass surgery was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, vascular anomalies were diagnosed with cardiac CT angiography in 5 (5.1%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, CT angiography was also used for previously planned evaluation of a coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coronary CT angiography may be useful to exclude significant CAD in patients referred for valvular disease surgery </plain></SENT>
