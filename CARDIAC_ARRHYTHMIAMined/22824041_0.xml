<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that increased cardiac-specific expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi>-3-kinase-α (PI3Kα), the key mediator of physiological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, results in transcriptional upregulation of ion channel subunits in parallel with the increase in myocyte size (<z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp>) and the maintenance of myocardial excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experiments here were undertaken to test the hypothesis that Akt1, which underlies PI3K��-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp>, mediates the effects of augmented PI3Kα signaling on the transcriptional regulation of cardiac ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise (swim) training of mice (Akt1(-/-)) lacking Akt1 did not result in ventricular myocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ventricular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current amplitudes and the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel subunits, however, were increased markedly in Akt1(-/-) animals with exercise training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of the transcripts encoding inward (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and Ca(2+)) channel subunits were also increased in Akt1(-/-) ventricles following swim training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments in a transgenic mouse model of inducible cardiac-specific expression of constitutively active PI3Kα (icaPI3Kα) revealed that short-term activation of PI3Kα signaling in the myocardium also led to the transcriptional upregulation of ion channel subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of cardiac Akt activation with triciribine in this (inducible caPI3Kα expression) model did not prevent the upregulation of myocardial ion channel subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These combined observations demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise training and enhanced PI3Kα expression/activity result in transcriptional upregulation of myocardial ion channel subunits independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp> and Akt signaling </plain></SENT>
