<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine if adrenergic hormones play a critical role in the functional development of the cardiac pacemaking and conduction system, we employed a mouse model where adrenergic hormone production was blocked due to targeted disruption of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> β-hydroxylase (Dbh) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent histochemical evaluation of the major gap junction protein, connexin 43, revealed that its expression was substantially decreased in adrenergic-deficient (Dbh-/-) relative to adrenergic-competent (Dbh+/+ and Dbh+/-) mouse hearts at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), whereas pacemaker and structural protein staining appeared similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate cardiac electrical conduction in these hearts, we cultured them on microelectrode arrays (8×8, 200 μm apart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show a significant slowing of atrioventricular conduction in adrenergic-deficient hearts compared to controls (31.4±6.4 vs. 15.4±1.7 ms, respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine if the absence of adrenergic hormones affected heart rate and rhythm, mouse hearts from adrenergic-competent and deficient embryos were cultured ex vivo at E10.5, and heart rates were measured before and after challenge with the β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (0.5 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hearts showed <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> responses following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> challenge, but a significant (p&lt;0.05) 225% increase in the arrhythmic index (AI) was observed only in adrenergic-deficient hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that adrenergic hormones may influence heart development by stimulating connexin 43 expression, facilitating atrioventricular conduction, and helping to maintain cardiac rhythm during a critical phase of embryonic development </plain></SENT>
