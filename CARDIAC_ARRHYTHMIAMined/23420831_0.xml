<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- After intramyocardial injection, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may engraft and influence host myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, engraftment rate and pattern of distribution are difficult to control in vivo, hampering assessment of potential adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the role of the engraftment patterns of MSCs on arrhythmicity in controllable in vitro models is investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Cocultures of 4Ã—10(5) neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and 7% or 28% adult human MSCs (hMSCs) in diffuse or clustered distribution patterns were prepared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological effects were studied by optical mapping and patch-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In diffuse cocultures, hMSCs dose-dependently decreased neonatal rat cardiomyocyte excitability, slowed conduction, and prolonged action potential duration until 90% repolarization (APD90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triggered activity (14% versus 0% in controls) and increased inducibility of re-entry (53% versus 6% in controls) were observed in 28% hMSC cocultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSC clusters increased APD90, slowed conduction locally, and increased re-entry inducibility (23%), without increasing triggered activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological heterocellular electric uncoupling increased excitability and conduction velocity to 133% in 28% hMSC cocultures, but did not alter APD90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transwell experiments showed that hMSCs dose-dependently increased APD90, APD dispersion, inducibility of re-entry and affected specific ion channel protein levels, whereas excitability was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incubation with hMSC-derived exosomes did not increase APD in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Adult hMSCs affect arrhythmicity of neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures by heterocellular coupling leading to depolarization-induced conduction slowing and by direct release of paracrine factors that negatively affect repolarization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The extent of these detrimental effects depends on the number and distribution pattern of hMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that caution should be urged against potential adverse effects of myocardial hMSC engraftment </plain></SENT>
