<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> following cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of postoperative AF is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp>, caused by the unavoidable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion event occurring in this setting, is a major contributory factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived effects could result in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protein carbonylation, or DNA oxidation of cardiac tissue, thus leading to functional and structural myocardial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vulnerability of myocardial tissue to the oxidative challenge is also dependent on the activity of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High ROS levels, overwhelming this system, should result in deleterious cellular effects, such as the induction of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, or autophagy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, tissue exposure to low to moderate ROS levels could trigger a survival response with a trend to reinforce the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), known to involve a moderate ROS production, is consistent with a diminished vulnerability to the development of postoperative AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, supplementation of n-3 PUFA successfully reduced the incidence of postoperative AF after coronary bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This response is due to an up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, as shown in experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In turn, non-enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> reinforcement through <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> administration prior to cardiac surgery has also reduced the postoperative AF incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it should be expected that a mixed therapy result in an improvement of the cardioprotective effect by modulating both components of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We present novel available evidence supporting the hypothesis of an effective prevention of postoperative AF including a two-step therapeutic strategy: n-3 PUFA followed by <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> supplementation to patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present study should encourage the design of clinical trials aimed to test the efficacy of this strategy to offer new therapeutic opportunities to patients challenged by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion events not solely in heart, but also in other organs such as kidney or liver in transplantation surgeries </plain></SENT>
