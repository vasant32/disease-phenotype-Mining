<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to determine its predictive value in the occurrence of AF after cardiac surgery with CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective observational study, including patients scheduled for cardiac surgery with CPB, we collected blood samples for each patient: the first one immediately after the induction of anesthesia and before CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subsequent samples were taken at the end of the CBP (H0), 4 hours later (H4), and every day during the first four days (H24, H48, H72 and H96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nt-proBNP and cardiac troponin (cTnI) were measured in each sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of Nt-proBNP were significantly increased in patients who developed AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of Nt-proBNP studied at different times showed that assays at the end of the CPB and at H4 had the maximum area under the curve (AUC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A threshold value of 353.5 pg/mL of Nt-proBNP at the end of the CPB showed a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 84% for the prediction of AF and an AUC of 0.711 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The threshold value (307.5 pg/mL) of Nt- proBNP measured at H4 had the same sensitivity but a lower specificity (74%) and AUC = 0.709 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Nt-proBNP values of 353 and 307 pg/mL at 0 and 4 hour after CPB could predict occurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
