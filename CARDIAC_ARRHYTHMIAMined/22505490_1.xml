<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, success rates are only moderate and could be improved with the help of personalized simulation models of the atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we present a workflow to generate and validate personalized EP simulation models based on routine clinical computed tomography (CT) scans and intracardiac electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From four patient data sets, we created anatomical models from angiographic CT data with an automatic segmentation algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From clinical intracardiac catheter recordings, individual conduction velocities were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these subject-specific EP models, we simulated different pacing maneuvers and measurements with circular mapping catheters that were applied in the respective patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This way, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm and pacing from a coronary sinus catheter were simulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wave directions and conduction velocities were quantitatively analyzed in both clinical measurements and simulated data and were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On average, the overall difference of wave directions was 15Â° (8%), and the difference of conduction velocities was 16 cm/s (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The method is based on routine clinical measurements and is thus easy to integrate into clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the long run, such personalized simulations could therefore assist treatment planning and increase success rates for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
