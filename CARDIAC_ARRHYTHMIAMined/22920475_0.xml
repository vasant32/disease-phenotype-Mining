<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The last few decades have witnessed a global rise in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> of epidemic proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential impact of this is emphasized when one considers that body mass index (BMI) is a powerful predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality [1, 2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly we have witnessed a parallel rise in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the commonest sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which is also a significant cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Part of this increase is attributable to advances in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) improving life expectancy and consequently the prevalence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, epidemiological studies have demonstrated an independent association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and AF, possibly reflecting common pathophysiology and risk factors for both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are associated with structural and functional changes of the cardiovascular system including left atrial and ventricular remodeling, haemodynamic alterations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is characterized by an adverse structural and functional cardiac phenotype which may predispose to the development of AF [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological and mechanistic relationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and AF, and the challenges posed in the management of this high-risk group of individuals </plain></SENT>
