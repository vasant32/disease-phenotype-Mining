<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a new addition to the long list of these inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NLR, which is calculated from complete blood count with differential, is an inexpensive, easy to obtain, widely available marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, which can aid in the risk stratification of patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in addition to the traditionally used markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been associated with arterial stiffness and high coronary calcium score, which are themselves significant markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NLR is reported as an independent predictor of outcome in stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, as well as a predictor of short- and long-term mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is linked with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and higher long-term mortality in patients undergoing PCI irrespective of indications of PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients admitted with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, high NLR was reported with higher inpatient mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recently, NLR has been reported as a prognostic marker for outcome from coronary artery bypass grafting and postcoronary artery bypass grafting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
