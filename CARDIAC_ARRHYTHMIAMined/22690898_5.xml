<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its incidence is poorly defined, few series are available, and population-based diagnostic criteria have not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We surveyed TS in Japan, defined its characteristics, and formulated diagnostic criteria, FINAL-CRITERIA1 and FINAL-CRITERIA2, for two grades of TS, TS1, and TS2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first developed diagnostic criteria based on 99 patients in the literature and 7 of our patients (LIT-CRITERIA1 for TS1 and LIT-CRITERIA2 for TS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thyrotoxicosis</z:e> was a prerequisite for TS1 and TS2 as well as for combinations of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system manifestations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>), and gastrointestinal (GI)/hepatic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then conducted initial and follow-up surveys from 2004 through 2008, targeting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitals in Japan, with an eight-layered random extraction selection process to obtain and verify information on patients who met LIT-CRITERIA1 and LIT-CRITERIA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 282 patients with TS1 and 74 patients with TS2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these data and information from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan, we estimated the incidence of TS in hospitalized patients in Japan to be 0.20 per 100,000 per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum-free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> and free triiodothyroine concentrations were similar among patients with TS in the literature, Japanese patients with TS1 or TS2, and a group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> without TS (Tox-NoTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 11.0% in TS1, 9.5% in TS2, and 0% in Tox-NoTS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple organ failure was the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in TS1 and TS2, followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, hypoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446648" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain syndrome</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale results and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN) were associated with irreversible damages in 22 survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The only change in our final diagnostic criteria for TS as compared with our initial criteria related to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> concentration &gt;3 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TS is still a life-threatening disorder with more than 10% mortality in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We present newly formulated diagnostic criteria for TS and clarify its clinical features, prognosis, and incidence based on nationwide surveys in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This information will help diagnose TS and in understanding the factors contributing to mortality and irreversible complications </plain></SENT>
