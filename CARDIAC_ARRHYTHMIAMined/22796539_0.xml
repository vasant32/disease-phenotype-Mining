<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between mechanics and electrophysiology is crucial to our understanding of mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While several technologies exist for describing whole heart electrophysiology, studies of cardiac mechanics are often limited to rhythmic patterns or small sections of tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a comprehensive system based on ultrafast three-dimensional (3-D) structured light imaging to map surface dynamics of whole heart cardiac motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we introduce a novel nonrigid motion-tracking algorithm based on an isometry-maximizing optimization framework that forms correspondences between consecutive 3-D frames without the use of any fiducial markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining our 3-D imaging system with nonrigid surface registration, we are able to measure cardiac surface mechanics at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrate accurate cardiac deformation at over 200,000 surface points of a rabbit heart recorded at 200 frames/s and validate our results on highly contrasting heart motions during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm, ventricular pacing, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
