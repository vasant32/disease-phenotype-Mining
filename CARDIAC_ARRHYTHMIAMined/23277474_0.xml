<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the pharmacology of disease processes in therapeutically and genetically relevant primary cell types in vitro and to interweave clinical and basic molecular data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the derivation of iPSCs from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> patient with complex genetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband was found to have a de novo SCN5A <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>-3 mutation (F1473C) and a polymorphism (K897T) in KCNH2, the gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the biophysics and molecular pharmacology of ion channels expressed in cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from these iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) demonstrates a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>-3 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel) defect responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> not influenced by the KCNH2 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The F1473C mutation occurs in the channel inactivation gate and enhances late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel current (I(NaL)) that is carried by channels that fail to inactivate completely and conduct increased inward current during prolonged depolarization, resulting in delayed repolarization, a <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp>, and increased risk of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We find a very pronounced rate dependence of I(NaL) such that increasing the pacing rate markedly reduces I(NaL) and, in addition, increases its inhibition by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel blocker mexiletine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These rate-dependent properties and drug interactions, unique to the proband's iPSC-CMs, correlate with improved management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the patient and provide support for this approach in developing patient-specific clinical regimens </plain></SENT>
