<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss measurement of [Ca]SR and [Ca]SRT, how [Ca]SR regulates activation and termination of release, and how Ca diffuses within the SR and influences SR Ca release during excitation-contraction coupling, Ca sparks and Cac waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The entire SR network is connected and its lumen is also continuous with the nuclear envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rapid Ca diffusion within the SR could stabilize and balance local [Ca]SR within the myocyte, but restrictions to diffusion can create spatial inhomogeneities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental measurements and mathematical models of [Ca]SR to date have greatly enriched our understanding of these [Ca]SR dynamics, but controversies exist and may stimulate new measurements and analysis </plain></SENT>
