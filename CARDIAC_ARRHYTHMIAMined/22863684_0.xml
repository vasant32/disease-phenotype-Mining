<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bipolar ablation between 2 ablation catheters may be considered for such circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of bipolar irrigated ablation to terminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> resistant to unipolar ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro: Bipolar and sequential unipolar RF ablation lesions were placed on porcine ventricular tissue in a saline bath to assess for lesion transmurality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical: 3 patients with atypical septal flutter (AFL), 4 patients with septal VT, and 2 with left ventricle free-wall VT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom failed sequential unipolar RF ablation, underwent bipolar RF ablation using irrigated catheters placed on either surface of the interatria/interventricular septum and left ventricle free-wall, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro: Bipolar RF was found to be more likely to achieve transmural lesions (82% vs 33%; P = .001) and could do so in tissues with thicknesses of up to 25 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 AFLs (3 patients) were successfully terminated with bipolar RF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, AFL recurred in 2 of the 3 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and AFL recurred in 1 of the 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 thereafter underwent repeat procedures with successful maintenance of sinus rhythm in 2 of the 3 patients (6-month follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the VT subgroup, 5 of 6 septal VTs and 2 of 3 free-wall VTs were terminated successfully during ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In follow-up (12 months), 2 of the 4 patients in the septal bipolar group and 1 of the 2 patients in the free-wall group remained free of VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar RF can be used to terminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in select patients with tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
