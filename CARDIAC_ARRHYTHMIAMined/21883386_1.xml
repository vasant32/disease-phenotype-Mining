<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the steady-state pharmacokinetic and QT(c) effects of domperidone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi>, given alone and together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy subjects (14 men, 10 women; age 18-39 years; mean weight 73.5kg, range 53.8-98.8kg; 23 Europid, 1 Afro-Caribbean) received orally, for 7 days each, placebo, domperidone 10mg, four doses daily, at 4h intervals, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> 200mg 12-hourly and domperidone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The washout period was 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetics and serial 12-lead ECGs were assessed on day 7, and serial ECGs on day -1 and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two subjects withdrew before the third treatment period, so data were available for 22-24 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> tripled domperidone concentrations at steady-state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Domperidone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> and their combination significantly increased QT(c) F in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall adjusted mean differences from placebo were 4.20 (95% CI 0.77, 7.63), 9.24 (95% CI 5.85, 12.63) and 15.90 (95% CI 12.47, 19.33) ms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, QT(c) F was not significantly different from placebo on either domperidone or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> alone, or in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, QT(c) was positively correlated with plasma drug concentrations, in both men and women. ΔQT(c) F increased by about 2ms per 10ngml(-1) rise in domperidone concentration, and per 1µgml(-1) rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">Ketoconazole</z:chebi> tripled the plasma concentrations of domperidone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Domperidone and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> increased QT(c) F in men, whether given together or separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The effect of domperidone alone was below the level of clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The negative result in women is unexplained </plain></SENT>
