<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine (RAN) is a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker shown to exert antiarrhythmic effects in pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) sleeves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>dl-Sotalol (SOT) is a β-blocker commonly used in the rhythm-control treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the electrophysiological and antiarrhythmic effects of VER, RAN, and SOT in canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeve preparations in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Transmembrane action potentials were recorded from canine superfused <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeve preparations exposed to VER (n = 6), RAN (n = 6), and SOT (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Delayed afterdepolarizations were induced in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> and high-calcium concentrations by periods of rapid pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeves, VER, RAN, and SOT (3-30 μM) produced small (10-15 ms) increases in action potential duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effective refractory period, diastolic threshold of excitation, and the shortest S(1)-S(1) cycle length permitting 1:1 activation were significantly increased by VER and RAN in a rate- and concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VER and RAN significantly reduced V(max) in a concentration- and rate-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SOT did not significantly affect the effective refractory period, V(max), diastolic threshold of excitation, or the shortest S(1)-S(1) cycle length permitting 1:1 activation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> sleeves, the effects of VER and RAN were similar and largely characterized by concentration- and rate-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel-mediated parameters, which were largely unaffected by SOT </plain></SENT>
