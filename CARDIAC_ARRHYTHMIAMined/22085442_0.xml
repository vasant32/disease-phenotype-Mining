<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CO-induced cardiotoxicity leads to several deleterious effects, including electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulation factor (G-CSF) on ECG after CO poisoning in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single and multiple doses of G-CSF (10, 50, and 100 Âµg/kg) were administered to groups, each containing 5 male Wistar rats (16 groups for ECG analysis and 16 groups for pathological analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were already exposed to CO at either 1,500 or 3,000 ppm concentrations for 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECG findings (e.g., ST-segment and T-wave changes), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart blocks</z:hpo> and ventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>), and histological changes were determined after G-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3,000 ppm, frequencies of ST elevation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and T inversion in ECG were significantly reduced after G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> type 1 and 2) after CO poisoning were suppressed after G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, G-CSF did not show protective effects on cardiomyocyte pathological consequences in CO-poisoned rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, G-CSF could protect against ECG changes after CO-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp>, but did not affect pathological changes </plain></SENT>
