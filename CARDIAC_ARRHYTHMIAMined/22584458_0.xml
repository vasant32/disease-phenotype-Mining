<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the frequency of rare non-synonymous variants in genes contributing to the maintenance of heart rhythm in cases of diLQTS using targeted capture coupled to next-generation sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 31 diLQTS subjects (36%) carried a novel missense mutation in genes with known congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associations or with a known cLQTS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 26 Caucasian subjects, 23% carried a highly conserved rare variant predicted to be deleterious to protein function in these genes compared with only 2-4% in public databases (P&lt;0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the rare variation in genes responsible for congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> syndromes is frequent in diLQTS </plain></SENT>
