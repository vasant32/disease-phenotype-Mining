<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose There may be an increase in the risk of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> due to left atrial enlargement and the influence on conduction system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate atrial electromechanical delay and P-wave dispersion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients A total of 48 patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and 40 volunteers of similar age, sex, and body mass index were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study groups were compared for M-mode echocardiographic parameters, interatrial electromechanical delay, intra-atrial electromechanical delay, and P-wave dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maximum P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, and interatrial electromechanical delay were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference in terms of intra-atrial electromechanical delay (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, a positive correlation was identified between the left atrium diameter and the P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay (r = 0.524 and p &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.351 and p = 0.014, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an important correlation was also identified between the P-wave dispersion and the interatrial electromechanical delay (r = 0.494 and p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows the prolongation of P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left atrial enlargement can be one of the underlying reasons for the increase in P-wave dispersion and interatrial electromechanical delay </plain></SENT>
