<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>Junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> is common after pediatric heart surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> repair, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> may be as high as 15% to 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We introduced prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> for tetralogy repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was started in the operating room at the time of rewarming during cardiopulmonary bypass at a rate of 2 mg/kg/d and continued for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between November 2005 and November 2009, 63 consecutive patients underwent primary repair of tetralogy, of whom 20 had prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> group) and 43 did not (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variables studied included demographic and bypass data, surgical procedure details (transannular or nontransannular patch), preoperative and postoperative echocardiography findings, and postoperative inotropic support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and stepwise multivariate analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> was 37% in the control group and 10% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The groups were similar in age, weight, bypass time, rate of transannular patch usage, and preoperative and postoperative gradient through the right ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was significantly negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> by both univariate (P = .039) and multivariate (P = .027) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no adverse events attributable to prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> is well tolerated and significantly associated with a decreased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> after tetralogy repair </plain></SENT>
