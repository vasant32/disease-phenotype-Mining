<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>Atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> is a rare but well-recognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> of uncertain clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association between crista terminalis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011995'>atrial septal aneurysm</z:hpo> is unusual but not completely casual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both anatomical heart structures can lead to atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes the accidental discovery during an echocardiographic examination of a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical relevance of this anatomical evidence in unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was an occasional finding of transthoracic echocardiography, but in this case it is possible to assume its relationship with the occurrence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and also that computed tomography scan and cardiovascular magnetic resonance is mandatory to define the structure and function of these incidental findings </plain></SENT>
