<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) patients are at risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) related to scar tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) can accurately identify myocardial scar extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that scar extent, particularly scar transmurality, percent scar and scar mass, are associated with the occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, quantification of transmurality extent has never been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether different methods quantifying scar transmurality, percent scar and scar mass (assessed with LGE-CMR) can predict appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy in CAD patients with a long term follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled retrospectively 66 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> CAD referred for primary or secondary preventive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and LGE-CMR before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using LGE-CMR, scar extent was assessed by measuring scar mass, percent scar and transmural scar extent using four different methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 41.5 months (interquartile range 22-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was the occurrence of appropriate device therapy and occurred in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> revascularization and transmural scar extent were significantly associated with the study endpoint but the latter was especially highly dependent on the method used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with appropriate device therapy had also larger scar mass (29.6 ± 14.5 g vs 17.1 ± 8.8 g, p = 0.004), and larger percent scar (15.1 ± 8.2% vs 9.9 ± 5.6%, p = 0.03) than patients without appropriate device therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, scar extent variables remained significantly associated with the study end-point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study of CAD patients implanted for primary or secondary preventive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> revascularization and scar extent studied by LGE-CMR were significantly associated with appropriate device therapy and can identify a subgroup of CAD patients with an increased risk of life-threatening VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Depending of the method used, transmural scar extent may vary significantly and needs further studies to obtain a validated and consensual study method </plain></SENT>
