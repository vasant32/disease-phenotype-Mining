<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac cells with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> are usually characterized by impairment of Ca(2+) handling with smaller SR Ca(2+) store and high risk of triggered activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a coupled model by integrating the spatiotemporal Ca(2+) reaction-diffusion system into the cellular electrophysiological model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the coupled model, the subcellular Ca(2+) dynamics and global cellular electrophysiology could be simultaneously traced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proposed coupled model was then applied to study the effects of rogue RyRs on Ca(2+) cycling and membrane potential in failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simulation results suggested that, in the presence of rogue RyRs, Ca(2+) dynamics is unstable and Ca(2+) waves are prone to be initiated spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These release events would elevate the membrane potential substantially which might induce delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the variation of membrane potential depolarization is indicated to be dependent on the distribution density of rogue RyR channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study provides a new possible arrhythmogenic mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> from subcellular to cellular level </plain></SENT>
