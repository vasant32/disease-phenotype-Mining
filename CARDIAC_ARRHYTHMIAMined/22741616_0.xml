<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> encountered following cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most commonly administered drug used in treatment and prophylaxis is <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> which has several toxic effects on major organ functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are few clinical data concerning prevention of toxic effects and there is no routinely suggested agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to document the cytotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> on cell culture media and compare the cytoprotective effects of commonly used <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: L929 mouse fibroblast cell line was cultured and 100,000 cells/well-plate were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First group of cells were treated with increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (20 to 180 μM) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second and third group of cells were incubated with one-fold equimolar dose of <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The viability of cells were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and the cytoprotective effect of each agent was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> was significant with concentrations of 100 μM and more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The viabilities of both <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine treated cells were higher compared to untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">Vitamin C</z:chebi> and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> cysteine are commonly used in the clinical setting for different purposes in context of their known <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their role in prevention of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> induced cytotoxicity is not fully documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study fully demonstrates the cytoprotective role of both agents in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> induced cytotoxicity on cell culture media; more pronounced with <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> in some concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings may be projectile for further clinical studies </plain></SENT>
