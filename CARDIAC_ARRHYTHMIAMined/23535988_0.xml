<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was conducted to study the effect of blood pressure reduction on LVH regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the relationship between different degrees of systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) reduction and LVH regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 17 randomized controlled trials comprising 2196 hypertensive patients (mean age, 56.3 years; 64.1% were men) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different degrees of SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> reductions were significantly associated with LVH regression: SBP reduction 20 mm Hg (SBPM20) (weighted mean difference (WMD): 14.35 g m(-2); 95% confidence interval (CI): 10.44, 18.26; P&lt;0.0001); SBP reduction &lt;20 mm Hg (SBPL20 group) (WMD: 14.82 g m(-2); 95% CI: 9.83, 19.8(2); P&lt;0.0001); <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> reduction 10 mm Hg (DBPM10 group) (WMD: 15.17 g m(-2); 95% CI: 11.86, 18.48; P&lt;0.0001); and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> reduction &lt;10 mm Hg (DBPL10 group) (WMD: 11.76 g m(-2); 95% CI: 3.75, 19.76; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant regression of LVH was found in the DBPM10 group compared with the SBPM20, SBPL20 and DBPL10 groups (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant decrease in LVH was seen in patients with a mean age over 60 years in the DBPM10 group </plain></SENT>
