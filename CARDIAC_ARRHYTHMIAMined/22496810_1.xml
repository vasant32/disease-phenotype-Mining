<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurement of oxygen consumption from intact neurons enables evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> bioenergetics under conditions that are more physiologically realistic compared to isolated mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, mechanistic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function in cells is complicated by changing energy demands and lack of substrate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a technique for sequentially measuring respiration from intact and saponin-permeabilized cortical neurons on single microplates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique allows control of substrates to individual electron transport chain complexes following permeabilization, as well as side-by-side comparisons to intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the utility of the technique, we demonstrate that inhibition of respiration by the drug KB-R7943 in intact neurons is relieved by delivery of the complex II substrate succinate, but not by complex I substrates, via <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> saponin permeabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> succinate, a putative cell permeable complex II substrate, failed to rescue respiration in intact neurons and was a poor complex II substrate in permeabilized cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential measurements of intact and permeabilized cell respiration should be particularly useful for evaluating indirect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> toxicity due to drugs or cellular signaling events which cannot be readily studied using isolated mitochondria </plain></SENT>
