<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study evaluated the effects of adjuvant <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-125 ((125)I) brachytherapy on postoperative recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGYPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From July 2000 to June 2004, 68 <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients undergoing curative hepatectomy were randomly assigned into a (125)I adjuvant brachytherapy group (n = 34) and a group of best care (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the (125)I adjuvant brachytherapy group received (125)I seed implantation on the raw surface of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the best care control group received identical treatments except for the (125)I seed implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time to recurrence (TTR) and 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up ended in January 2010, and lasted for 7.7-106.4 months with a median of 47.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTR was significantly longer in the (125)I group (mean of 60.0 months vs. 36.7 months in the control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free rates of the (125)I group were 94.12%, 76.42%, and 73.65% vs. 88.24%, 50.00%, and 29.41% compared with the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates of the (125)I group were 94.12%, 73.53%, and 55.88% vs. 88.24%, 52.94%, and 29.41% compared with the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The (125)I brachytherapy decreased the risk of recurrence (HR = 0.310) and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR = 0.364) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most frequent adverse events in the (125)I group included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, decreased white blood cell and/or platelet counts, and were generally mild and manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONSSIGNIFICANCE: Adjuvant (125)I brachytherapy significantly prolonged TTR and increased the OS rate after curative resection of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
