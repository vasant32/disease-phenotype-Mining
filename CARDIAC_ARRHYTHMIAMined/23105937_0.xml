<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate is known to be related to diverse phenotypes, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, lifespan, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported two genomewide significant genetic loci responsible for the variation in pulse rate as a part of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, the genomewide association study (GWAS) that was conducted with 352,228 single nucleoride polymorphisms typed in 8,842 subjects in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GJA1 was implied as a functionally causal gene for pulse rate from the KARE study, but lacked evidence of replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To re-evaluate the association of a locus near GJA1 with pulse rate, we looked up this signal in another GWAS conducted in a Health Examinee-shared cohort of 3,703 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Not only we were able to confirm two pulse rate loci (1q32.2a near CD46 and 6q22.13c near LOCL644502) identified in the KARE GWAS, we also replicated a locus (6q22.31c) near GJA1 by the lookup in the Health Examinee GWAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering that the GJA1-encoded protein is a major component of cardiac gap junctions, a functional study might be necessary to validate its genuine molecular biological role in the synchronized contraction of the heart </plain></SENT>
