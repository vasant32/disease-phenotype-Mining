<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought to determine the clinical and survival outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) associated with left ventricular (LV) lead location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lateral left ventricle has been considered the optimal LV lead location for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular lead cinegrams taken in 30° right and left anterior oblique views were evaluated in 457 recipients of CRT with a pacemaker or a defibrillator from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2008 in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead placement was prioritized at implantation into posterolateral (PL), anterolateral (AL), middle cardiac, and anterointerventricular coronary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using echocardiographic LV 16-segment analysis, we grouped the leads as anterior, AL, PL, and posterior locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and echocardiography were assessed before and after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and survival outcomes after CRT were compared among the four LV lead locations.  Patient baseline demographic characteristics were similar among these four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement in NYHA class was significantly greater in the AL (P= 0.04) and PL (P= 0.03) locations than in the anterior location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a tendency for greater improvement in LV ejection fraction among the AL (P= 0.11) and PL (P= 0.08) locations than the anterior location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival estimate at 4 years varied for location: AL, 72%; anterior, 48%; PL, 62%; and posterior, 72% (P= 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients are profiting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lead positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, LV lead placed in the AL and PL positions is more preferential for achieving optimal CRT benefit than leads placed in the anterior position </plain></SENT>
