<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of reference data for many species is limiting the clinical value of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study 26 Andean condors (Vultur gryphus) coming from rehabilitation and captive breeding programs were examined to determine electrocardiographic references prior to being released </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard bipolar (I, II, and III) and augmented unipolar limb (aVR, aVL, and aVF) leads were recorded with birds under physical restraint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five beats were analyzed on Lead II at 50 mm/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> and 1 cm = 1 mV to determine QRS complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cardiac rhythm, heart rate, P, PR, R, S, QRS, T, QT, and ST amplitude and/or duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P and T wave configuration was determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads, and Mean Electrical Axis (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) in the frontal plane was determined using leads I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac rhythm corresponded to regular sinus rhythm in 42% of the birds, with a relevant rate of sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 58%, and rS as the most common pattern (42%) for QRS complex in lead II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found an influence of age and heart rate but not of sex on several ECG waves and intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relevant ECG findings for studied Andean condors include a high rate of T(a) , R', and U wave detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Waves T(a) and R' were considered non-pathological, while the significance of U waves remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a useful reference to improve clinical interpretation of full electrocardiographic examination in Andean condors </plain></SENT>
