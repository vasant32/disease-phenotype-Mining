<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to search for LMNA mutations in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of Polish subjects (N = 103) with non-valvular <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with a high (48.5%) prevalence of conduction system disturbances was screened for LMNA variants by direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a single non-synonymous variant (Thr528Met) in a 72-year-old patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular function and episodes of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of his two mutation-carrying daughters had episodes of type I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011706'>second-degree atrioventricular block</z:hpo> on a 24-hour Holter ECG and peak exercise <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo> observed in the other daughter was complicated by thyroid insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Thr528Met weak pathogenic effect was supported by transient transfections of C2C12 mouse myoblasts and computationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another interesting variant was Ile26Ile (c.78C&gt;T), found in a New York Heart Association class III patient with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (30%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ile26Ile was absent in 246 healthy individuals and was computationally predicted to interfere with splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: LMNA mutations are not a frequent cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> even when conduction disease is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unlike the majority of LMNA mutations clearly associated with a severe clinical phenotype and a poor prognosis, Thr528Met results in a more subtle pathogenic effect, while Ile26Ile should be considered as a variant of unknown significance </plain></SENT>
