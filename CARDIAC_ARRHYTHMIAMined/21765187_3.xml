<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HRV was assessed using 24-h Holter monitoring in 305 subjects from the Renal Research Institute-CKD Study, a four-center prospective cohort of CKD (Stages 3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to assess predictors of HRV (both time and frequency domain) and Cox regression used to predict outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>, composite of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 47 CVD, 67 ESRD and 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> events occurred over a median follow-up of 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower HRV was significantly associated with older age, female gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, higher heart rate, C-reactive protein and <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi>, lower serum albumin and Stage 5 CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lower HRV (mostly frequency domain) was significantly associated with higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and the composite end point of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly, lower HRV (frequency domain) was associated with higher risk of progression to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>, although this effect was relatively weaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study draws attention to the importance of HRV as a relatively under recognized predictor of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with nondialysis CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether interventions that improve HRV will improve these outcomes in this high-risk population deserves further study </plain></SENT>
