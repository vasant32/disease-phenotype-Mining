<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>Pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) is common to a range of cardiopulmonary conditions and is associated with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known of the isolated atrial effects of PH and right atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (RA) in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To avoid the confounding effects of PH-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, we performed detailed electrophysiological (EP) and electroanatomic (EA) mapping of the RA in patients with idiopathic PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight PH patients (mean pulmonary arterial [PA] pressure 39.0 ± 15.8 mmHg) and 16 age-matched controls (mean PA pressure 11.5 ± 4.1 mmHg, P &lt; 0.0001) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corrected sinus node recovery times (cSNRT), atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs), conduction delay at the crista terminalis (CT), and inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EA mapping (pacing cycle length 600 and 300 milliseconds) was performed to determine RA global and regional voltage, conduction velocities, atrial activation times, fractionated electrograms and double potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with PH demonstrated a prolongation in cSNRT without significant change in atrial ERP and an increase in AF inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PH was associated with lower tissue voltage (1.8 ± 0.4 mV in PH vs 2.2 ± 0.4 mV in controls, P = 0.02), increased low voltage areas (13.7 ± 8.2% in PH vs 6.2 ± 3.7% in controls, P &lt; 0.01) and the presence of electrically silent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocities were slower (global 67.3 ± 5.6 cm/s vs 92.8 ± 4.0 cm/s, P &lt; 0.001) and fractionated electrograms and double potentials were more prevalent (14.7 ± 4.4% vs 6.3 ± 4.1, P &lt; 0.01) in PH compared with controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Idiopathic PH is associated with RA remodeling characterized by: generalized conduction slowing with marked regional abnormalities; reduced tissue voltage; and regions of electrical silence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes provide important insights into the isolated effects of PH fundamental to a range of clinical conditions associated with AF </plain></SENT>
