<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated pharmacologic atrial defibrillation via the CS in dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> AF was induced by rapid atrial pacing for 4-16 weeks in 6 mongrel dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 7F occlusion balloon catheter was introduced into the proximal CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Boluses of low doses of the class Ic antiarrhythmic drug, pilsicainide (2, 4, 6, and 8 mg as needed) or class III antiarrhythmic drug, nifekalant (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg) were infused directly within 3-4 seconds at 10 minute intervals into the temporarily balloon occluded CS near its orifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4 of the 5 dogs (balloon catheter could not be placed in the CS in 1 dog), the cumulative dose of 11.5 ± 7.4 mg of pilsicainide was effective in restoring sinus rhythm; the venous concentration of pilsicainide was 1.23 ± 0.79 µg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cumulative dose of 7.5 mg nifekalant restored sinus rhythm in only 1 of the 6 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results in dogs with sustained AF indicate that delivery of a class Ic or III antiarrhythmic drug near the CS ostium via the temporarily occluded CS is feasible and effective for pharmacologic atrial defibrillation; however, the effect may be related to the elevation of the serum concentration of the drug to the therapeutic range rather than to the delivery method itself </plain></SENT>
