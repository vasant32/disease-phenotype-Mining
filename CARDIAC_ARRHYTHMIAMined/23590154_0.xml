<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of brief daily reoxygenation during adaptation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> continuous <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (CCH) on protective cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Wistar rats were kept at CCH (10% oxygen) for 5, 15 or 30 days; a subgroup of animals was exposed to room air daily for a single 60-min period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While 5 days of CCH did not affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> induced by 20-min coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 3-h reperfusion, 15 days reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size from 62% of the area at risk in normoxic controls to 52%, and this protective effect was more pronounced after 30 days (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> exhibited reciprocal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CCH increased myocardial abundance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) without affecting malondialdehyde concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Daily reoxygenation abolished both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size-limiting effect of CCH and MnSOD up-regulation, and increased malondialdehyde (by 53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from CCH rats exhibited better survival and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release caused by simulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion than cells from normoxic and daily reoxygenated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cytoprotective effects of CCH were attenuated by the large-conductance <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated K+ (BKCa) channel blocker paxilline, while the opener NS1619 reduced cell injury in the normoxic group but not in the CCH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Daily reoxygenation restored the NS1619-induced protection, whereas paxilline had no effect, resembling the pattern observed in the normoxic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that CCH is cardioprotective and brief daily reoxygenation blunts its salutary effects, possibly by a mechanism involving <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and attenuation of the activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> BKCa channels </plain></SENT>
