<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) reduces mortality in patients at risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> via high energy shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Florida Shock <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Scale (FSAS) was developed to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patient shock-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial psychometric evaluation revealed good reliability and validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometrics of the FSAS in a large US sample of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants were recruited via e-mail and the survey was completed online </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, 443 ICD patients (359 male and 421 White) completed the 10-item FSAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Means for FSAS were comparable to previously published data (M = 15.18, SD = 6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interitem reliability was good (Cronbach's α= 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The FSAS was negatively correlated with single-item measures of emotional well-being (r =-0.378, P &lt; 0.01), sense of security (r =-0.365, P &lt; 0.01), perceived general health (r =-0.185, P &lt; 0.01), and quality of life (r =-0.216, P &lt; .01), demonstrating discriminant validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Convergent validity was supported through significant correlations with number of shocks (r = 0.464, P &lt; 0.01) and reported disruptiveness of shock (r = 0.484, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a single (second-order) factor model (χ(2) [34] = 75.34, P &lt; 0.05, comparative fit index = 0.98, root mean-square error of approximation = 0.05) had the best fit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Shock <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> as a construct can be measured in a reliable and valid method by the FSAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These nationally representative data suggest that a single score for shock <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> is an easy to use and appropriate method of assessment </plain></SENT>
