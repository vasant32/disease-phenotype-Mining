<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A variety of chemical and biological nonlinear excitable media, including heart tissue, exhibit vortices (spiral waves) that can anchor to nonexcitable obstacles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such anchored vortices can be terminated by the application of high-frequency wave trains, as shown previously in isotropic excitable media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the basic dependencies of the conduction velocities of planar waves and waves around curved obstacles as a function of anisotropy through numerical simulations of excitable media that mimic the fiber orientation in a real heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the unpinning of anchored spiral waves by high-frequency wave trains in an anisotropic excitable medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike the findings regarding the termination of spiral waves in isotropic excitable systems, we found a nonmonotonic relationship between the maximum unpinning period and the obstacle radius depending on the fiber orientation, where the formation of unwanted secondary pinned vortices or chaotic waves is seen over a wide range of parameters </plain></SENT>
