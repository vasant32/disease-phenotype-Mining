<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When AF did not terminate during ablation procedure, electrical cardioversion was performed at different defibrillation threshold (DFT) according to AF characteristics and atrial electrophysiologic substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate the impact of atrial DFT after catheter ablation for persistent AF on clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 128 patients with persistent AF (age 63±9 years, 106 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After completion of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation, the left atrial substrate ablation was performed until AF terminated or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified complex fractionated electrograms were eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If AF did not terminate during ablation, an internal cardioversion protocol was started at 5J and was increased incrementally in 5 J steps until successful cardioversion was accomplished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural AF termination was achieved in 50 patients (Group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was terminated by cardioversion with DFT≤10 J in 47 patients (Group B) and with DFT&gt;10 J in 31 patients (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 14±7 follow-up months after 1.3±0.5 sessions, 47 (94%) Group A patients, 42 (89%) Group B patients, and 14 (45%) Group C patients remained in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of Group B and Group C, DFT (hazard ratio 5.54, P&lt;0.001) and AF duration (hazard ratio 3.74, P=0.011) were independent predictors of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When AF does not terminate after the completion of predetermined stepwise ablation, further extensive ablation to terminate AF might be unnecessary if the AF can be successfully terminated by electrical cardioversion at low DFT </plain></SENT>
