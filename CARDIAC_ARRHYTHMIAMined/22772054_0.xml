<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this survey was to report the outcome of the technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey was conducted among 20 centres from seven European countries including 2748 patients (2128 with paroxysmal and 620 with persistent AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In paroxysmal AF an overall success rate of 82% [median 80%, interquartile range (IQR) 74-90%], a first procedure success rate of 72% [median 74% (IQR 59-83%)], and a success of antiarrhythmic medication of 59% [median 60% (IQR 39-72%)] was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In persistent AF, success rates were significantly lower with 70% [median 74% (IQR 60-92%)]; P = 0.05) as well as the first procedure success rate of 58% [median 55% (IQR 47-81%)]; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate was similar among higher and lower volume centres and were not dependent on the duration of experience with duty-cycled RFA (r = -0.08, P = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications were observed in 108 (3.9%) patients, including 31 (1.1%) with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which had the same incidence in paroxysmal and persistent AF (1.1 vs. 1.1%) and was unrelated to the case load (r = 0.24, P = 0.15), bridging anticoagulation to low molecular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, routine administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> over the long sheath, whether a transoesophageal echocardiogram was performed in every patient or not and average procedure times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Duty-cycled RFA has a self-reported success and complication rate similar to conventional RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After technical modifications a prospective registry with controlled data monitoring should be conducted to assess outcome </plain></SENT>
