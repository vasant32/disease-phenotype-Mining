<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine whether AC location differs by gender in a large cohort of patients with AC undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in two Israeli electrophysiology (EP) laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients who underwent RFA of single ACs in Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between 1992 and 2009 (n = 574) as well as the first consecutive 230 patients who underwent RFA in Sheba Medical Center between 1992 and 2001 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 804 patients in the two centers included 511 males (63.6 %) and 293 (36.4 %) females, mean age 34 + 16 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AC was located in the left free wall, posteroseptal, right free wall, right anteroseptal, and in other areas in 57.8, 22.8, 9.3, 7 and 3.1 % of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomical AC distribution was similar in the two EP laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A right free wall location was more frequent in females (13 %) than in males (7.2 %; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A right anteroseptal location was more frequent in males (8.4 %) than in females (4.4 %) (p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left free wall and posteroseptal locations were similarly encountered in males (58.1 and 23.1 %, respectively) and in females (57.3 and 22.2 %, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our Israeli population, females more commonly have right free wall ACs and males more commonly have right anteroseptal ACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings support the possible role of a genetic component in the pathogenesis of AC formation </plain></SENT>
