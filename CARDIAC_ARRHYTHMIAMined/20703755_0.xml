<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to corruption of ECG signals with multiple frequency noise and presence of multiple arrhythmic events in a cardiac rhythm, computerized interpretation of <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> rhythms is a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper focuses a Fuzzy C- Mean (FCM) clustered Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Multi Layered Feed Forward Network (MLFFN) for the discrimination of eight types of ECG beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters such as fourth order Auto Regressive (AR) coefficients along with Spectral Entropy (SE) are extracted from each ECG beat and feature reduction has been carried out using FCM clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cluster centers form the input of neural network classifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extensive analysis of Massachusetts Institute of Technology- Beth Israel Hospital (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database shows that FCM clustered PNNs is superior in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> classification than FCM clustered MLFFN with an overall accuracy of 99.05%, 97.14%, respectively </plain></SENT>
