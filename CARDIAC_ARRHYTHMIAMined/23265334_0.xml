<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the impact of rhythm- versus rate-control treatment strategies and of underlying rhythm on quality of life and functional capacity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although intention-to-treat and efficacy analyses have demonstrated similar cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> randomized to rhythm or rate control, effects on quality of life remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The AF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive Heart Failure</z:hpo>) trial randomized 1,376 patients to rhythm- or rate-control strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this pre-specified substudy, Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 questionnaires were administered at baseline and 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six-min walk tests were conducted at baseline, 3 weeks, 4 months, and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quality of life improved across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains to a similar extent with rhythm and rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a higher proportion of time spent in sinus rhythm was associated with a modestly greater improvement in quality of life scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six-min walk distance (p = 0.2328) and New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.1712) improved to a similar degree with rhythm and rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of time spent in sinus rhythm was associated with a greater improvement in New York Heart Association functional class (p &lt; 0.0001) but not in 6-min walk distance (p = 0.1308) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in quality of life and functional capacity were similar in patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> randomized to rhythm- versus rate-control strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, sinus rhythm was associated with beneficial effects on New York Heart Association functional class and modest gains in quality of life </plain></SENT>
