<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic study (EPS) is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of the patient's age on the causes and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 98 patients, mean age 35 ± 18 years, with WPW were admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Note that 29 were aged between 9 and 19 years (mean 15 ± 3) (children and teenagers/group I), 45 between 20 and 49 years (mean 34 ± 8) (adults/group II), and 24 between 50 and 70 years (mean 60 ± 8) (elderly/group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EPS consisted of atrial pacing and programmed atrial stimulation in control state and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Potentially malignant form (rapid conduction in accessory pathway &gt;240 beats/min in control state or &gt;300 beats/min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> [AF] induction) was more frequent in group I (34%) than in groups II (7%) (P &lt; 0.002) and III (0%) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT) and AF were induced as frequently in groups I (59, 34%), II (47, 15.5%), and III (54, 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AVRT was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient with malignant form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EPS was as frequently negative in groups I (27.5%), II (44%), and III (37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Natural follow-up (mean 8 ± 6 years) indicated a favorable prognosis, only related to AVRT induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Induced AF was without significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW syndrome</z:e> depended on age: electrophysiological malignant form was frequent in children/teenagers, rare in adults, and absent in elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AVRT, the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, was as frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ranges of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>AF's induction alone had no significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Final prognosis was favorable </plain></SENT>
