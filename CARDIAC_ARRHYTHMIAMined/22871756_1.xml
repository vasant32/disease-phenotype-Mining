<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A previous study suggested a potential increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> with new use of long-acting β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46659,5957">ipratropium bromide</z:chebi> in patients with COPD, although conclusions were limited by the small cohort size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reassessed this association in a larger cohort formed from the health-care databases of the province of Quebec, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified a cohort of patients with COPD aged ≥ 67 years who began treatment between 1990 and 1999 and followed them until December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nested case-control approach matched each subject who developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during follow-up with 20 control subjects from the cohort on age, sex, and calendar time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate ratio (RR) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> associated with new use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi> was estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for COPD disease severity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and other comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort included 76,661 patients with COPD, of whom 5,307 developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (10.3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> per 1,000 per year), 621 of which were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> was elevated with the new use of short-acting (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57) and long-acting (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15) β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate was slightly elevated, although not statistically significantly, with new use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46659,5957">ipratropium bromide</z:chebi> (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.95-1.57) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthines</z:chebi> (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.93-1.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These effects waned with longer-term use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New use of short- and long-acting β-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may slightly increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in patients with COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46659,5957">ipratropium bromide</z:chebi> also increases this risk, despite the use of a larger study population </plain></SENT>
