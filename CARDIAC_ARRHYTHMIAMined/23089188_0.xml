<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To find out whether it is possible to anaesthetize patients safely without <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> and sedation, using burst pacing prolonged until the patient becomes unconscious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and four patients undergoing implantation or reimplantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients randomized into Group B underwent prolonged burst pacing without <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> and sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in Group T underwent a T-wave shock under <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> and sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples for measurement of serum neuron-specific enolase were taken before surgery and 6, 24, and 48 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 104 patients, 51 were randomly assigned to Group B and 53 to Group T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients from Group B were switched to Group T (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> not induced by burst pacing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of both groups were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean total time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> was significantly longer in Group B (23.0 ± 4.4 s, median 22.7) vs. Group T (10.3 ± 3.0 s, median 10.0), P &lt; 0.0001 (Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of both induction methods was similar (92.1% in Group B and 100% in Group T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean neuron-specific enolase levels after 6, 24, and 48 h were similar in Groups B and T (13.1 ± 6.3 and 11.6 ± 5.8 mg/L, 14.5 ± 7.5 and 13.4 ± 6.0 mg/L, and 14.9 ± 5.9 and 12.2 ± 6.0 mg/L, respectively) as were these levels compared with baseline neuron-specificenolase levels (14.0 ± 5.9 and 13.4 ± 4.0 mg/L, respectively), P = NS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite a longer time of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, prolonged burst pacing appears to be a safe and effective method for induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> during cardioverter-defibrillator testing, which enables omission of <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> and sedation or general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
