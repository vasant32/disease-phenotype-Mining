<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Low DCa may predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, whereas high DCa increases the long-term risk of soft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tissue calcifications</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients treated in four dialysis centres underwent two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> sessions, respectively, with 1.5 and 1.25 mmol/L total DCa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcium mass balance (CMB) was calculated from ionized calcium (iCa) in the dialysate and blood at the start and end of each run, using a kinetic formula to define the mean concentrations in the blood and dialysate and then estimating CMBs over the entire treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean blood iCa levels increased using 1.5 DCa, whereas they remained unchanged using 1.25 DCa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusive CMB positively correlated with the dialysate/blood iCa gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With 1.5 DCa, diffusive CMBs were strongly positive at the blood side and negative at the dialysate side, indicating transfer from dialysate to blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With 1.25 DCa, despite a negative dialysate/blood iCa gradient, diffusive CMB was slightly positive in blood and negative in dialysate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The global balances based on both the convective and diffusive components showed a positive net transfer of Ca from dialysate to blood with 1.5 DCa and an approximately neutral Ca flux with 1.25 DCa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While CMB is nearly neutral when using 1.25 DCa, the use of 1.5 DCa results in a gain of Ca during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risks associated with Ca load should be considered in the choice of DCa prescription for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> but need also be weighed against the risk of worse haemodynamic dialysis tolerance </plain></SENT>
