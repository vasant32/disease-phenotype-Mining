<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though the variability in drug response between individuals has been extensively studied, this information has not been widely used in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rapid advances in the field of pharmacogenomics have provided us with crucial insights on inter-individual genetic variability and its impact on drug metabolism and action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technologies for faster and cheaper genetic testing and even personal genome sequencing would enable clinicians to optimize prescription based on the genetic makeup of the individual, which would open up new avenues in the area of personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have systematically looked at literature evidence on pharmacogenomics markers for anti-arrhythmic agents from the OpenPGx consortium collection and reason the applicability of genetics in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also discuss potential issues that need to be resolved before personalized pharmacogenomics becomes a reality in regular clinical practice </plain></SENT>
