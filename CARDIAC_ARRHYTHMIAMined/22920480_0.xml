<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that up to 16 million people in the US will suffer from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> by 2050 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF is an independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor and associated with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For six decades, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> has been the only truly effective therapy to protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the proven worth of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, its limitations have seen reluctance amongst physicians and patients to utilise this efficacious agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This has meant that substantial numbers of patients are either unprotected against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or suboptimally protected with antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contemporary well-validated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor schemes (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc) now permit rapid but comprehensive evaluation of a patient's risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, allowing better identification of low-risk patients who do not require antithrombotic therapy, and whilst for those with â‰¥1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors require formal oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aspirin has been proven to be inferior to anticoagulation, and is not free of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also have simple scores to easily evaluate a patient's risk of haemorrhage (e.g. HAS-BLED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The emergence of new oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> should further improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in AF, and they successfully negotiate many of the hurdles to oral anticoagulation generated by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>'s limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monitoring, reversal, and perioperative management are areas which require further investigation to enhance our ability to safely and effectively utilise the new agents </plain></SENT>
