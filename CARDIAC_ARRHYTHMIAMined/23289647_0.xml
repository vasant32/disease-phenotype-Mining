<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated the health benefits of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="25681">omega-3 fatty acids</z:chebi> (n-3), whereas recent RCTs were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now address the issue, focusing on the temporal changes having occurred: most patients in recent RCTs are no longer n-3 deficient and the vast majority are now treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent RCTs testing n-3 against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> suggest that n-3 reduce the risk only in patients not taking a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other recent RCTs in secondary prevention were negative although, in a post-hoc analysis separating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users and non-users, non-significant protection of n-3 was observed among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> non-users whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> users had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent RCTs testing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> - after the implementation of the New Clinical Trial Regulation in 2007 - are negative (or flawed) suggesting that the lack of effect of n-3 cannot be attributed to a parallel protection by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> favor the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36009">omega-6 fatty acids</z:chebi> (n-6), which in turn inhibits n-3 and, contrary to n-3, they increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, n-3 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> are counteractive at several levels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> appear to inhibit n-3 </plain></SENT>
