<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In paediatric patients with a pacemaker (PM) or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) device, interrogation during in-clinic visits is usually required to obtain information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or system failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An automated telemonitoring system tracking patient- and system-related parameters provides this information on a daily basis and might assist patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective analysis evaluates telemetric data obtained from 48 devices implanted in 45 patients (median age, 12.4 years; range, 5 weeks to 37.6 years) using an automated system [Home Monitoring (HM)] over the last 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regular transmissions were received on 72% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The event messages and monitoring data of 34 (71%) devices induced system revisions, electrophysiological studies including ablation, programming changes, medication changes, and alterations in sporting activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately 47% of event messages and 50% of emergency messages arrived within 4 weeks of implantation or latest outpatient visit; 113 (17%) emergency messages reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes in lead parameters or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, which required medical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients, delivered shocks were unreported and only detected by HM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An automated telemonitoring system reporting patient- and system-related parameters, generated within the patient's home surrounding, can improve the safety and quality of PM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, especially in children, by allowing early detection of system failure and changes in arrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
