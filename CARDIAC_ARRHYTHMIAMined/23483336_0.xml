<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physicians have considerable latitude over equipment choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average Medicare reimbursement is $10,338 for uncomplicated AF ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost of special equipment chosen by physicians to perform AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained the list price cost of special capital equipment and of disposable equipment (intracardiac ultrasound probes, transseptal needles/sheaths, and ablation/recording catheters) commonly used for radiofrequency (RF) AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the equipment cost of using robotic magnetic navigation and cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then we evaluated costs for several physician equipment choice scenarios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using open irrigated-tip catheters, the lowest estimated cost-per-case for manual RF ablation of AF was $6,637, and the highest estimated cost of manual RF ablation was $12,603 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assuming 200 AF ablations/year and a 6-year magnet life, the cost-per-case of using magnetic navigation ablation ranged from $12,261-$15,464 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cost-per-case using cryoballoons alone ranged from $12,847-$15,320, and if focal cryoablation or RF touch-up is needed, cryoablation cost increased to $15,942-$22,284 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Physicians have many choices in AF ablation equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Equipment costs in our arbitrary scenarios range from $6,637 to $22,284 per case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More important than the specific cost of each scenario is the concept that these are physician-driven costs, and as such, physicians will need to determine if more expensive technologies increase procedural efficacy and/or patient safety enough to justify the greater procedural equipment costs </plain></SENT>
