<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> shoulder pain and disability in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred fifty-four patients (mean age, 66 ± 12 years; 156 men) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) was used for assessment of shoulder pain and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients, 131 (52 %) have shoulder pain and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total mean SPADI score in patients with shoulder pain and disability was 33 ± 18 and was significantly higher than in patients without shoulder pain and disability (11 ± 2; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with three-lead <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> have significantly higher SPADI scores than patients with single-lead <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Number of leads correlated with pain score (p = 0.001, r = 0.253), disability score (p = 0.006, r = 0.174) and total SPADI score (p = 0.001, r = 0.213) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, significant associates of shoulder pain and disability were evaluated, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, procedure time, implantation time interval, limitation of shoulder activity and number of leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Number of leads was the only predictor of shoulder pain and disability (OR 0.518, 95 % CI, 0.372-0.721; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation frequently have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> shoulder pain and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with three leads suffer more shoulder pain and disability </plain></SENT>
