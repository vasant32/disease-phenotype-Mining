<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) affects more than 5 million people in the United States and is one of the most common reasons for recurrent hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the majority of admissions related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> are secondary to progressively worsening <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath>, many clinicians are quick to initiate aggressive <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> once early signs of impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> develop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These signs are based in large measure on patient-reported symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, recent trials have shown that traditional ambulatory monitoring of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> using patient symptoms or body weight do not reduce episodes of decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> requiring hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This has led to great interest in developing monitoring systems that can detect impending episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> even prior to the development of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the these systems utilize existing implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices to monitor electrophysiologic parameters including the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, heart rate variability and even transthoracic impedances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other more recent developments have focused on more invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems that can measure pressures in the right ventricle, pulmonary arteries and the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data on the utility of such systems is limited but encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While none of these systems are currently FDA approved, they have been applied in a number of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This paper highlights the currently available monitoring systems for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and reviews the evidence supporting its use </plain></SENT>
