<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Later, we could observe frequent polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A massive production of anti-Yersinia IgM, IgG and IgA as a sign of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> could be found, although we were not able to detect the microbe itself with culturing methods </plain></SENT>
