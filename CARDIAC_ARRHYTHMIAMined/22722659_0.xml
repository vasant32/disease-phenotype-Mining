<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> is directly linked to mutations in proteins (eg, type 2 ryanodine receptor [RyR2](R4496C)) responsible for intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of Ca(2+) release dysfunction underlying catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> has only been investigated in isolated cells but not in the in situ undisrupted myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated in situ myocyte Ca(2+) dynamics in intact Langendorff-perfused hearts (ex vivo) from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice using laser scanning confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that myocytes from both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and RyR2(R4496C+/-) hearts displayed uniform, synchronized Ca(2+) transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) transients from beat to beat were comparable in amplitude with identical activation and decay kinetics in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and RyR2(R4496C+/-) hearts, suggesting that excitation-contraction coupling between the sarcolemmal Ca(2+) channels and mutated RyR2(R4496C+/-) channels remains intact under baseline resting conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On adrenergic stimulation, RyR2(R4496C+/-) hearts exhibited a high degree of Ca(2+) release variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The varied pattern of Ca(2+) release was absent in single isolated myocytes, independent of cell cycle length, synchronized among neighboring myocytes, and correlated with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of action potential variability, which was synchronized among neighboring myocytes, was also revealed under adrenergic stress in intact hearts but not in isolated myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our studies using an in situ confocal imaging approach suggest that mutated RyR2s are functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at rest but display a high degree of Ca(2+) release variability on intense adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) release variability is a Ca(2+) release abnormality, resulting from electric defects rather than the failure of the Ca(2+) release response to action potentials in mutated ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data provide important insights into Ca(2+) release and electric dysfunction in an established model of catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
