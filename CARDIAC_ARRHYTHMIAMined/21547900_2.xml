<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Relative to age-matched controls, the FXS group had faster baseline heart rate and lower amplitude respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the typically developing controls, there was a decrease in RSA with age within the FXS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, within the FXS group heart rate did not slow with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FXS group also responded with an atypical increase in RSA to the social challenge, while the control group reduced RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subset of the FXS group, the autonomic profile did not change following 2 months and 1 year of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed indices of atypical autonomic regulation, consistent with the Polyvagal Theory, may contribute to the deficits in social behavior and social communication observed in FXS </plain></SENT>
