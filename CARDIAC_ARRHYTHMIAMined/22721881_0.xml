<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The mechanism(s) which underline findings of severe adverse drug reactions (ADR) noted in more than a thousand published articles on CHIs, are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With 109 CHIs currently in clinical use, we investigated the proarrhythmic effects of three specific CHIs, Shuanghuanglian (SHL), Qingkailing (QKL) and Yinzhihuang (YZH), using in vivo and in vitro ion channel models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo and in vitro guinea pig electrocardiogram, intracellular action potential and patch clamp recording techniques were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both SHL and QKL (both in one, five and ten times clinically relevant doses (CRD) for in vivo and clinically relevant concentrations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) for in vitro) prolonged P-R intervals in a dose or concentration-dependent manner and SHL also prolonged QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>YZH (ten and 20 times CRD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) prolonged P-R intervals without changing QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracellular action potential recordings from guinea pig papillary muscle indicated SHL and QKL abolished the firing of action potentials at ten and 30 times <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SHL significantly suppressed L-type Ca(2+) current from left ventricular myocytes of guinea pig, hNav1.5 current and hERG current with 50% inhibiting concentrations (IC(50)) of 6.0, 3.0 and 10.7 times <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, QKL significantly suppressed L-type Ca(2+) and hNav1.5 currents with IC(50)s of 10.7 and 13.8 times <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>YZH significantly suppressed L-type Ca(2+), hNav1.5 and hERG currents with IC(50)s of 12.1, 32.9 and 141.7 times <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The three CHIs studied caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmia</z:e> mainly by inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current and L-type Ca(2+) current </plain></SENT>
