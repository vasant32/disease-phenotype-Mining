<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies suggest that dysfunction of delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Kr)) is the main cause for the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of vitamin E in the rabbit model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The QT interval and action potential duration were considerably prolonged with frequent occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in diabetic rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of vitamin E corrected the abnormal QT prolongation and abolished the arrhythmic incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I(Kr) was found markedly reduced resulting in slowing of cardiac repolarization thereby QT prolongation in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of I(Kr) is primarily ascribed to oxidative damages to the cardiac membrane and proteins, as indicated by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species leading to severe <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and protein oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, I(Kr) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is most likely due to the dysfunction of HERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel, the major subunit underlying native I(Kr), in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, for <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-generating system produced similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of HERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vitamin E restored the depressed I(Kr) and HERG by its <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> actions which likely underlie its beneficial effects on diabetic QT prolongation and the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> is sufficient for reversing the I(Kr)/I(HERG) dysfunction and the consequent electrical disorders in diabetic hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study also conceptually simplifies the complex nature of diabetic electrical disorders to primarily <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and should stimulate interest in <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> as a therapeutic strategy for diabetic QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
