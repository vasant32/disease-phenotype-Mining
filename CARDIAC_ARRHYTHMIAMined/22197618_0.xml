<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The choice of prosthesis for aortic valve replacement in young and middle-aged patients remains challenging owing to the accelerated degeneration of bioprostheses in these age groups and the risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> with mechanical valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, the living pulmonary autograft (Ross operation) would be advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term results of the various Ross techniques are needed for defining the value of this surgical concept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of a total of 576 subcoronary Ross patients operated on between June 1994 and June 2011, we report on 203 consecutive subcoronary patients (mean age, 47.2±13.6 years, 155 male, 2,491 patient-years) with a follow-up of at least 10 years (mean, 12.3±2.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early and late mortality were 0.98% (n=2) and 11.4% (n=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Valve-related mortality was 2.5% (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival did not differ from that of the general German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from autograft or allograft reoperation was 92.2% at 10 years and 87.1% at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (0.20%/patient-year) and 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (0.44%/patient-year) occurred in 5 and 10 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither a systematic increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> nor an increase in root dimensions with time could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the vast majority of patients, valvular hemodynamics at latest echocardiographic follow-up were excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results of the original subcoronary Ross operation reveal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> survival, excellent hemodynamics, low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and small risk for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results favor the pulmonary autograft concept in young and middle-aged patients in experienced centers and may serve to better define its role in surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260873" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic valve disease</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
