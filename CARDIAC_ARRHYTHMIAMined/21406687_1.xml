<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a 4-generation family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> progressive cardiac conduction disease, including atrioventricular conduction block and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to chromosome 1p22-q21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of the LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear-envelope protein lamin A/C, revealed a novel gene rearrangement involving a 24-bp inversion flanked by a 3.8-kb deletion upstream and a 7.8-kb deletion downstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of short inverted sequence homologies at the breakpoint junctions suggested a mutational event involving serial replication slippage in trans during DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified for the first time a complex LMNA gene rearrangement involving a double deletion in a 4-generation Dutch family with progressive conduction system disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings underscore the fact that if conventional polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequencing approaches for LMNA analysis are negative in suggestive pedigrees, mutation detection techniques capable of detecting gross genomic lesions involving deletions and insertions should be considered </plain></SENT>
