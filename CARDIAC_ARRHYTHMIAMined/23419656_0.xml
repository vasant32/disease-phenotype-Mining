<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although remote FU offers comparable monitoring options to in-office FU, reprogramming of device settings is not available, thereby imposing a potentially important restriction to the applicability of remote FU.  The aim of this study was to assess in a large cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> PM recipients, the incidence of PM reprogramming during long-term FU and its predictors, to judge the possibilities for remote FU.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2010 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in-office FU of 1517 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> PM recipients included in the FOLLOWPACE study were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 24.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 258 recorded FU visits &gt;3 months after implantation were visits-with-reprogramming (VWRs), occurring in 1158 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients were free of reprogramming at 9 months, and 29% at 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, the following patient characteristics were predictive for frequent PM reprogramming, defined as &gt;3 VWRs during 3 year FU: age, a history of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, PM complication &lt;3 months after implantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, PM indication, and lead fixation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This model had a receiver operating characteristic area of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.61-0.71).CONCLUSION: This study observed a low proportion of VWR (∼25%) during a mean FU of 5.3 years; however, those patients at high risk for PM reprogramming cannot easily be predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients (&gt;80%) do not need frequent reprogramming, suggesting a potential benefit of using remote FU to reduce the number of unnecessary in-office visits </plain></SENT>
