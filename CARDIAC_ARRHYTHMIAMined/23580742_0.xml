<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Management of TS is a challenge and prognosis is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to explore the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern and mechanism of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> blocker, mexiletine, to improve clinical manifestations in TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -A 2-year-old Chinese girl with a typical TS1 phenotype underwent candidate gene screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative cloning sequence and analyses for mosaicism were performed on family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effects of mexiletine were evaluated using ECG and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiologic effect of mexiletine was evaluated in a TS model using rabbit ventricular wedges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proband with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023012" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delayed language</z:e> skills was identified harboring a G406R mutation in CACNA1C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her baseline-ECG showed markedly prolonged QTc, 2:1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB) and macro T wave alternans (TWA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>G406R was absent in her mother but expressed in her father's oral mucosa, sperm and white blood cells, indicating a mosaic carrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Though asymptomatic he exhibited mild QTc prolongation (470-490 ms) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mexiletine shortened QTc from 584 to 515 ms, blunted QT-RR relationship, and abolished 2:1 AVB and TWA in the girl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In in vitro studies, mexiletine inhibited late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> with IC50 of 17.6±1.9 μM and attenuated brady-dependent QT prolongation and reduced QT-RR slope in the TS model using BayK 8644 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Mexiletine shortened QTc, attenuated QT-RR slope, abolished 2:1 <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> and TWA in a TS1 patient and TS model via inhibition of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
