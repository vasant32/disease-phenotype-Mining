<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human slow wave ranges from 2.5 to 3.75 cycles per min (cpm), tachygastrias range from 3.75 cpm to 10.0 cpm and bradygastrias from .5 to 2.5 cpm, the gastric dysrhythmias of men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this issue of Neurogastroenterology &amp; Motility, O'Grady, et al. describe the gastric dysrhythmias of pigs in electrocardiology terms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Printed circuit boards (PCB) with multi-electrode arrays (160-192 electrodes) were attached to the stomach serosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastric dysrhythmias occurred in eight of the 16 anesthetized pigs and were analysed by manually and by computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patterns of dysrhythmias were reminiscent of cardiac dysrhythmias: conduction blocks, ectopic foci, re-entrant wave fronts, premature and aberrant slow waves and regular and irregular tachygastrias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest gastric dysrhythmias recorded in pigs may be relevant to human gastric dysrhythmias and electricity-based therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The categories of porcine gastric dysrhythmias may help to understand the spectrum of gastric dysrhythmias of men and women recorded over the past 25 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interstitial cells of Cajal are the pacemaker cells of the stomach and <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cells</z:mp> or faulty circuitry appear to be key pathways to gastric dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gastric electrophysiology (EP) labs, human and animal, are needed to test hypotheses and advance understanding of human gastric dysrhythmias and upper GI symptoms </plain></SENT>
