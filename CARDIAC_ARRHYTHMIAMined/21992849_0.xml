<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the effects of human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, randomized study was conducted with 40 patients who had preoperative elevated B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (â‰¥ 30 pg/mL) and underwent a scheduled pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared between patients who received low-dose human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and those who received a placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during the first 4 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly lower in the human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> group than in the placebo group (10% vs 60%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> group also showed significantly lower white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of low-dose human atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> surgery had a prophylactic effect against postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after pulmonary resection in patients with preoperative elevation of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A larger sample size is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this intervention </plain></SENT>
