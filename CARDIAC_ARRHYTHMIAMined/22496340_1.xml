<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial results of small trials have been promising: shorter procedure times and low adverse event rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large single-centre registry, we evaluated the adverse events associated with multi-electrode ablation catheter procedures with PVAC alone, or combined with MASC and MAAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 634 consecutive patients with AF had 663 procedures with multi-electrode ablation catheters, 502 patients with the PVAC alone, 128 patients with PVAC/MASC/MAAC, 29 redo procedures with the PVAC or PVAC/MASC/MAAC, and 4 patients had a complicated transseptal puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major and minor adverse events during 6 month follow-up were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 15 cases (2.3%), major adverse events were seen within the first month after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These included complicated transseptal puncture (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (2), femoral pseudoaneurysm (1), and arteriovenous fistulae (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor adverse events were seen in 10.7% at 6 months, mostly due to femoral haematoma (3.9%), and non-significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> stenosis (5.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the occurrence of major adverse events between PVAC alone, or PVAC/MASC/MAAC ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablation with phased RF and multi-electrode catheters is accompanied by a major adverse event rate of 2.3% within 1 month and a minor event rate of 10.7% at 6 months </plain></SENT>
