<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 54 healthy subjects, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) were assessed at resting conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As an EEG indicator of cortical excitability, the contingent negative variation (CNV) was induced using a constant foreperiod reaction time task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At bivariate level, only RSA showed a moderate positive correlation with the CNV recorded at frontal electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when common variance of BRS and RSA was controlled for in multiple regression analysis, an inverse association between BRS and the frontal CNV also arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inverse association between BRS and the CNV is discussed as reflecting bottom-up modulation of cortical excitability by baroreceptor afferents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation between RSA and the CNV may relate to the interplay between prefrontal processing and cardiac vagal tone </plain></SENT>
