<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Type III procollagen-N-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PIIINP) may be related to atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and play a role in predicting the recurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether PIIINP as a <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> marker predicts the recurrence of AF after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Serum PIIINP, interleukin-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, renin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> were measured at baseline and 24 months in 88 patients (62%) with sinus rhythm (SR) maintenance and 54 patients (38%) with AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the root mean square voltage in the last 20 ms (RMS20) via P-wave signal-averaged electrocardiogram (P-SAECG) was measured and the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> biomarkers and RMS20 was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline PIIINP with AF recurrence was significantly higher than for those with SR maintenance (0.664 vs. 0.581 U/mL, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences in other biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression identified PIIINP (odds ratio 2.61, P = 0.008) as an independent predictor of AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RMS20 as measured by P-SAECG with SR maintenance and PIIINP levels &lt;0.72 U/mL (at baseline) was significantly higher after 24 months than at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the RMS20 with AF recurrence and PIIINP levels &gt;0.72 U/mL (at baseline) was significantly lower after 24 months than baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated baseline PIIINP concentration is an independent predictor for AF recurrence after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a relationship between PIIINP and RMS20 and the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of AF </plain></SENT>
