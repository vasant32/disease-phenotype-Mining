<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients with RVD and mitral valve prosthesis and a 1:2 matched control group (n = 56) without RVD underwent reablation for recurrent AT after catheter ablation of long-standing persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macro- or localized reentrant ATs were identified in 47 (87 %) of 54 ATs from RVD group and in 65 (78.3 %) of 83 ATs from control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were more average ATs per patient in the RVD group than in the control (1.9 ± 0.6 vs.1.5 ± 0.6, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients having ≥2 ATs was significantly higher in the RVD group than in the control (78.6 vs.41.1 %, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the RVD group, ATs were successfully ablated in 44 (81.5 %) of 54 ATs and terminated in 18 (64.3 %) of 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control, ATs were successfully ablated in 72 (86.7 %) of 83 ATs and terminated in 45 (80.4 %) of 56 patients, P = 0.54 and 0.10, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 13 months, 16 patients (57.1 %) from the RVD group and 45 patients (80.4 %) from the control were free of further recurrence, P = 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Macro- or localized reentries were the predominant type of recurrent AT after long-standing persistent AF ablation in both the RVD and the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without RVD, patients with RVD had more average number of ATs and had higher probability of further recurrence despite the similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effectiveness of reablation </plain></SENT>
