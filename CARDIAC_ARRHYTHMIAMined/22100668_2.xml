<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndrome</z:hpo> (diLQTS) is an adverse drug effect that has an important impact on drug use, development, and regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that common variants in key genes controlling cardiac electric properties modify the risk of diLQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a case-control setting, we included 176 patients of European descent from North America and Europe with diLQTS, defined as documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> during treatment with a QT-prolonging drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control samples were obtained from 207 patients of European ancestry who displayed &lt;50 ms QT lengthening during initiation of therapy with a QT-prolonging drug and 837 control subjects from the population-based KORA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were successfully genotyped at 1424 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 candidate genes including 1386 SNPs tagging common haplotype blocks and 38 nonsynonymous ion channel gene SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For validation, we used a set of cases (n=57) and population-based control subjects of European descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SNP KCNE1 D85N (rs1805128), known to modulate an important <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current in the heart, predicted diLQTS with an odds ratio of 9.0 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-22.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variant allele was present in 8.6% of cases, 2.9% of drug-exposed control subjects, and 1.8% of population control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the validation cohort, the variant allele was present in 3.5% of cases and in 1.4% of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This high-density candidate SNP approach identified a key <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel susceptibility allele that may be associated with the rare adverse drug reaction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
