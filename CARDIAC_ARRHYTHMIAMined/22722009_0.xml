<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six groups (n=6/group) of male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Mycobacterium butyricum (Inflamed) or saline (Control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (300mg/kg/day, p.o. commenced on day one); others received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> upon developing the early sign of AA; after amelioration of the disease, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> administration continued for one group while discontinued for another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a 25mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> administered, electrocardiographs were recorded and pharmacokinetic delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> concentration, body weight, paw thickness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> index were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac contents of L-type calcium channel, Î²1-adrenoreceptors and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi>-2 receptor were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> rats that received M. butyricum, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi>, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and improved the signs and symptoms after their emergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also restores the down-regulating effect of AA on the cardiac target proteins, pharmacokinetics and response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">GlcN</z:chebi> has controlling effect on AA and restores the down-regulating effect of AA on cardiac proteins and response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, perhaps, through its anti-inflammatory properties </plain></SENT>
