<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to analyse the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the PN by performing three-dimensional (3-D) imaging and pace mapping.METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> referred for catheter ablation were enrolled in this study and underwent preoperative cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with sinus rhythm during tomography, 3-D images of the right and left pericardiophrenic bundles (PBs), consisting of the ipsilateral PN and accompanying vessels, were reconstructed from the CT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the electrophysiological study, PN pace mapping was performed from both atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course of the PBs generated by CT imaging and the PN pace map generated by the 3-D mapping system were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By electrical pacing, the PNs were captured in 40 individuals (100%) from the superior vena cava and the right atrium, and in 17 patients (43%) from the left atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clear 3-D images of PBs were reconstructed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in which CT-reconstruction was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distance between the locations of the right PB generated by CT imaging and those of the right PN-capture sites in the right-sided heart on the mapping system was 8.7 Â± 5.8 mm.CONCLUSIONS: The 3-D routes of the bilateral PNs passing near the heart were verified by pace mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preoperatively reconstructed 3-D course of the PB succeeded in locating the PN, which may facilitate the comprehension of PN <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> to avoid its injury during interventional cardiovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
