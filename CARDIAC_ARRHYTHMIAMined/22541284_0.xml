<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past 10 years, many centers worldwide have reported high success rates and few complications after a single ablation procedure in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies indicate a short-term and long-term superiority of catheter ablation as compared with conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence, quality of life, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, catheter ablation is evolving to a front-line therapy in many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with persistent long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> catheter ablation strategy is more complex and time-consuming, frequently requiring repeat procedures to achieve success rates as high as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the near future, however, with growing experience and evolving technology, catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> may be extended also to patients with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
