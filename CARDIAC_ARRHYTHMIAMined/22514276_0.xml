<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is up-regulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and has been shown to cause I(Na) gating changes that mimic those induced by a point mutation in humans that is associated with combined long QT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify the site(s) on Na(V)1.5 that mediate(s) the CaMKII-induced alterations in I(Na) gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed both CaMKII binding and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the intracellularly accessible regions of Na(V)1.5 using a series of GST fusion constructs, immobilized <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> arrays, and soluble <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stable interaction between δ(C)-CaMKII and the intracellular loop between domains 1 and 2 of Na(V)1.5 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This region was also phosphorylated by δ(C)-CaMKII, specifically at the Ser-516 and Thr-594 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and phosphomutant hNa(V)1.5 were co-expressed with GFP-δ(C)-CaMKII in HEK293 cells, and I(Na) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As observed in myocytes, CaMKII shifted WT I(Na) availability to a more negative membrane potential and enhanced accumulation of I(Na) into an intermediate inactivated state, but these effects were abolished by mutating either of these sites to non-phosphorylatable Ala residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation of these sites to phosphomimetic Glu residues negatively shifted I(Na) availability without the need for CaMKII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Na(V)1.5 at multiple sites (including Thr-594 and Ser-516) appears to be required to evoke loss-of-function changes in gating that could contribute to acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>-like effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
