<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Through review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SCDs in Danes aged 18-35 years between 1 January 2000 until 31st December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then used the unique Danish civil registration number, which enabled us to follow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danes in national registries, in the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through the National Patient Registry we identified those with a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>)-8: 410, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-10: I21 and I22] and incidence rates for SCD were estimated for survivors of MI and for individuals who had not yet suffered an MI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the relative risk of SCD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality by using extended Cox regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1,862,431 Danes aged between 18 and 35 years were followed in 9,388,453 person-years between 2000 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 7434 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of which 387 (5.2%) were SCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 1234 patients, of those 10 died of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior MI increased the incidence rate of SCD from 4.1 to 305.0 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI): 164.1-567.0] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was correlated with SCD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 55.5 (95% CI: 29.5-104.4), P&lt; 0.0001 and HR 8.3 (95% CI: 6.0-11.3), P&lt; 0.0001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report that prior MI at a young age significantly increases SCD incidence from 4.1 to 305.0 per 100,000 person-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is furthermore correlated with SCD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality with HR of 55.5 and 8.3, respectively </plain></SENT>
