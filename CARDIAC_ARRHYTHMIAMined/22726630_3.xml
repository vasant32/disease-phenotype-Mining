<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis that response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) is modulated by 3 common loci associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified 3 loci, on chromosomes 4q25 (near PITX2), 16q22 (in ZFHX3), and 1q21 (in KCNN3), that associate with either typical or lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that variable mechanisms contribute to AF susceptibility, and suggest that response to therapy may be genotype dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 478 and 198 Caucasian patients in the discovery cohort and validation cohort, respectively, who were prospectively enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response was defined prospectively as successful rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months with â‰¥75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated AF recurrence by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients were also given a 24- to 48-h Holter monitor or 30-day event recorder when AF recurrence was not captured by 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, 399 (83%) patients were successfully rhythm controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple clinical variables (including age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, lone AF) failed to significantly predict response to AADs; however, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10033464 at 4q25 was an independent predictor of successful rhythm control in patients with typical AF carrying the ancestral allele (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp>) versus carriers of variant allele (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.83 to 12, p = 0.0013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the validation cohort, 143 (72%) patients met the criteria for successful rhythm control, and rs10033464 was again an independent predictor of successful rhythm control, OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.06, p = 0.04 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This SNP (rs10033464) was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in the discovery (39% AF recurrence) and validation (38% AF recurrence) cohorts; OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.7 to 6, p &lt; 0.001 and OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.98 to 9.4, p &lt; 0.001, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a common SNP on chromosome 4q25 associated with AF modulates response to AAD therapy and points to a potential role for stratification of therapeutic approaches by genotype </plain></SENT>
