<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Following pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), spontaneous dissociated firing (DiFi) from the isolated veins may be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the significance and prognostic implications of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the relationship between DiFi and ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 156 paroxysmal AF patients who underwent first time PVI and were found to have spontaneous DiFi from the pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their outcomes were compared to a population of 156 propensity-matched controls from our prospectively maintained AF ablation data registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DiFi was most frequently observed from the right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and occurred in 89 patients (57.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 24 months of follow-up, patients with DiFi had better success rates compared to those with silent veins after isolation (88.5% vs 75%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall distribution of types of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was similar between DiFi patients and their matched controls (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During repeat ablations, DiFi patients were less likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> conduction recovery (60% vs 93.3%, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, none of the veins with DiFi during index procedures was found to have conduction recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing ablation, DiFi from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> after their isolation was associated with improved ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is possible that DiFi is an indicator of successful durable isolation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that confirmation of exit block may be warranted to improve AF ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
