<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found it useful for clinical practice to study the long-term development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in patients diagnosed with idiopathic AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one consecutive idiopathic AF patients (56 ± 10 years, 66% male) were compared with 45 healthy control patients in permanent sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> and antiarrhythmic drugs, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, coronary artery or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, thyroid, pulmonary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, and structural abnormalities on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were equal in AF cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 66 ± 11 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> occurred significantly more often in idiopathic AF patients compared with controls (49 vs. 20%, P= 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic AF were significantly younger at the time of their first CV event compared with controls (59 ± 9 vs. 64 ± 5 years, P= 0.027), and had more severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that age, a history of AF, and echocardiographic left ventricular wall width were significant predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients originally diagnosed with idiopathic AF develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> more often, at younger age, and with a more severe disease profile compared with healthy sinus rhythm control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The detection and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in an early stage could improve the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At present it seems prudent to regularly check idiopathic AF patients for the insidious development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
