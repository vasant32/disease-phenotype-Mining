<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 2002 through 2008 we examined the annual proportion of patients ≥ 80 years old undergoing PCI in western Denmark, their indications for PCI, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 2002 through 2009 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elderly patients treated with PCI were identified in a population of 3.0 million based on the Western Denmark Heart Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis was used to compare mortality rates according to clinical indications controlling for potential confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total 3,792 elderly patients (≥ 80 years old) were treated with PCI and the annual proportion increased from 224 (5.4%) in 2002 to 588 (10.2%) in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical indication was stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> (SAP) in 30.2%, ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) in 35.0%, UAP/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1536222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-STEMI</z:e> in 29.7%, and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>" in 5.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 9.2% and 18.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with SAP the adjusted 1-year mortality risk was significantly higher for patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> (hazard ratio 3.86, 95% confidence interval 3.08 to 4.85), UAP/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1536222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-STEMI</z:e> (hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.53 to 2.50), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (hazard ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval 1.92 to 3.92) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the proportion of patients ≥ 80 years old treated with PCI increased significantly over an 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with SAP had the lowest mortality rates and rates of clinically driven target vessel revascularization decreased over time </plain></SENT>
