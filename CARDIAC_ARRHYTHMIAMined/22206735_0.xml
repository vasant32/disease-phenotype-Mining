<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> exposure predicts frontal T-wave axis deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>US adults 40 years of age or older from NHANES III were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>-corrected urinary <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> concentrations expressed as micrograms per gram were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frontal T-wave axis deviations were measured from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression analyses adjusting for age, race, smoking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, left ventricular mass, QRS duration and heart rate were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio of borderline and abnormal frontal T wave axis deviations due to <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> exposure and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.25 (1.10-1.54) and 1.64 (1.27-2.12), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study documents a positive graded relationship between environmental <z:chebi fb="113" ids="22977">cadmium</z:chebi> exposure and the risk for frontal T-wave axis deviation </plain></SENT>
