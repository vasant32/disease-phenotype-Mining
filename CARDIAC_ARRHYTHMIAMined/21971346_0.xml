<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective treatment is therefore essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to evaluate long-term outcome of ablative therapy of AT in ToF patients and to study characteristics of AT recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>Tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> patients (N = 38, age 43 ± 12 years) referred for ablation of post-operative AT, appearing 26 ± 10 years after complete repair, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electro-anatomical/entrainment mapping was performed prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation was defined as (i) achievement of bi-directional conduction block for isthmus-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (IDAF), (ii) termination during ablation for intra-atrial reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (IART) and focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (FAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two AT were ablated, including 37 IDAF [cycle length (CL) 294 ± 70 ms], 11 IART (CL 295 ± 46 ms), and 4 FAT (CL 371 ± 93 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation was successful in 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one of 52 AT involved the cavo-tricuspid isthmus and/or the area between scar tissue related to prior atriotomy incisions and the inferior caval vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple AT developed in 11 patients, with different mechanisms in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 45 ± 24 months, 32 patients were in sinus rhythm; 5 used anti-arrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablative therapy of AT in ToF patients is an effective curative treatment modality with a high procedural success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sinus rhythm during long-term follow-up was obtained in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one of 52 AT originated from sites related to surgical incisions created at complete repair, suggesting that extending the atriotomy incision towards the inferior caval vein during cardiac surgery combined with surgical ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus will be effective in preventing development of AT </plain></SENT>
