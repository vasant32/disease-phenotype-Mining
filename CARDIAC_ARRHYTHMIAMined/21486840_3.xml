<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The sympathetic adrenergic system plays a central role in stress signalling and stress is often associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the sympathetic adrenergic system is intimately involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> handling and contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we hypothesize that endogenously produced ROS contribute to the inotropic mechanism of β-adrenergic stimulation in mouse cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transients, cell shortening and ROS production were measured in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes using confocal microscopy and fluorescent indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) modification of proteins was detected with Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISO), a β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic agonist</z:chebi>, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production in cardiomyocytes in a concentration- and cAMP–protein kinase A-dependent but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hearts perfused with ISO showed a twofold increase in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> protein adducts relative to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ISO increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient amplitude, contraction and L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> current densities (measured with whole-cell patch-clamp) in cardiomyocytes and these increases were diminished by application of the general <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) or the mitochondria-targeted <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> SS31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production plays an integral role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inotropic response of cardiomyocytes to β-adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, chronically sustained adrenergic stress is associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and prolonged increases in ROS may contribute to these defects </plain></SENT>
