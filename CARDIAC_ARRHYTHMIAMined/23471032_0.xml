<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals afflicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> of glycosylation often have reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> sialylation and present with multi-system symptoms including <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel (Nav) activity can be influenced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acids</z:chebi> likely contributing to an external surface potential causing channels to gate at less depolarized voltages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, a possible pathophysiological role for reduced sialylation is investigated by questioning the impact of gene deletion of the uniformly expressed beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24163">galactoside</z:chebi> alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3Gal4) on cardiac Nav activity, cellular refractory period and ventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that ventricular Nav from ST3Gal4 deficient mice (ST3Gal4(-/-)) gated at more depolarized potentials, inactivated more slowly and recovered from fast inactivation more rapidly than WT controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current-clamp recordings indicated a 20% increase in time to action potential peak and a 30ms decrease in ST3Gal4(-/-) myocyte refractory period, concurrent with increased Nav recovery rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nav expression, distribution and maximal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current levels were unaffected by ST3Gal4 expression, indicating that reduced sialylation does not impact Nav surface expression and distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, enzymatic desialylation suggested that ST3Gal4(-/-) ventricular Nav are less sialylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the shortened myocyte refractory period, epicardial conduction experiments using optical mapping techniques demonstrated a 27% reduction in minimum ventricular refractory period and increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in ST3Gal4(-/-) ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, deletion of a single sialyltransferase significantly impacts ventricular myocyte electrical signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These studies offer insight into diseases of glycosylation that are often associated with pathological changes in excitability and highlight the importance of glycosylation in cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
