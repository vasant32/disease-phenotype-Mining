<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Na(V)1.5 expression are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forkhead box O (Foxo) proteins are transcriptional factors that bind the consensus DNA sequences in their target gene promoters and regulate the expression of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis revealed conserved DNA sequences, 5'-CAAAACA-3' (insulin responsive element, IRE), in rat, mouse and human SCN5a promoters with the latter two containing two overlapping Foxo protein binding IREs, 5'-CAAAACAAAACA-3' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding led us to hypothesize that Foxo1 regulates Na(V)1.5 expression by directly binding the SCN5a promoter and affecting its transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we determined whether Foxo1 regulates Na(V)1.5 expression at the transcriptional level and also defined the role of Foxo1 in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>)-mediated Na(V)1.5 suppression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-1 cardiomyocytes using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), constitutively nuclear Foxo1 expression, and RNAi Foxo1 knockdown as well as whole cell voltage-clamp recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ChIP with anti-Foxo1 antibody and follow-up semi-quantitative PCR with primers flanking Foxo1 binding sites in the proximal SCN5a promoter region clearly demonstrated enrichment of DNA, confirming Foxo1 recruitment to this consensus sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Foxo1 mutant (T24A/S319A-GFP, Foxo1-AA-GFP) was retained in nuclei, leading to a decrease of Na(V)1.5 expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current, while silencing of Foxo1 expression by RNAi resulted in the augmentation of Na(V)1.5 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> significantly reduced Na(V)1.5 expression by promoting Foxo1 nuclear localization and this reduction was prevented by RNAi silencing Foxo1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that Foxo1 negatively regulates Na(V)1.5 expression in cardiomyocytes and reactive oxygen species suppress Na(V)1.5 expression through Foxo1 </plain></SENT>
