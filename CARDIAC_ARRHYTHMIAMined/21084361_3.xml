<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the mechanical forces required to perforate a porcine heart with an ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 7 Fr, 3.5 mm irrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter with a force sensor (FS) within its tip was used to create right atrial (RA) free wall lesions in pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intact heart was removed and the FS-equipped catheter was used to mechanically perforate (without RF delivery) the free walls of both atria and ventricles: directly and through an introducer sheath to prevent catheter shaft buckling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> was also performed through epicardially visible RA lesions and adjacent unablated tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four RA free wall lesions were created in four pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-four mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> were performed: 44 RA, 30 left atrial (LA), 37 right ventricular (RV), and 33 left ventricular (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The RA and RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> force (PF) was lower than through the LA and LV (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> time was shorter when the catheter was gripped through an introducer sheath (0.8±0.5 vs. 3.2±3 s, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> force through transmural RA lesions was lower than through unablated RA tissue (172.4±79.1 vs. 300.6±116.8 g, P&lt;0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The force threshold for mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in the porcine heart is lower for right- compared with left-sided chambers, and also lower through recently created RA RF lesions compared with unablated RA tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> is achieved more rapidly with the ablation catheter in a sheath despite the same PF because the sheath prevents catheter buckling </plain></SENT>
