<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It included 20 patients (mean age 37.5+-2.3 years) with disturbed cardiac rhythm and sinus node dysfunction treated with allapinin (37.5 - 50 mg/d per os) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This therapy had well apparent antiarrhythmic effect manifest as improvement of supraventricular and ventricular ectopic activities in the absence of negative influence on the function of sinus and atrioventricular nodes </plain></SENT>
