<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) is an inherited genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> characterized by fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium and a predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> gene titin (TTN) as a candidate ARVC gene because of its proximity to an ARVC locus at position 2q32 and the connection of the titin protein to the transitional junction at intercalated disks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 312 titin exons known to be expressed in human cardiac titin and the complete 3' untranslated region were sequenced in 38 ARVC families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight unique TTN variants were detected in 7 families, including a prominent Thr2896Ile mutation that showed complete segregation with the ARVC phenotype in 1 large family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Thr2896IIe mutation maps within a highly conserved immunoglobulin-like fold (Ig10 domain) located in the spring region of titin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Native gel electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance, intrinsic fluorescence, and proteolysis assays of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant Ig10 domains revealed that the Thr2896IIe exchange reduces the structural stability and increases the propensity for degradation of the Ig10 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of TTN variant carriers was characterized by a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (5 of 7 families), progressive myocardial dysfunction causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or heart transplantation (8 of 14 cases), frequent conduction disease (11 of 14), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that titin mutations can cause ARVC, a finding that further expands the origin of the disease beyond desmosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Structural impairment of the titin spring is a likely cause of ARVC and constitutes a novel mechanism underlying myocardial remodeling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
