<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He underwent coronary ostial augmentation and main pulmonary artery translocation to the left pulmonary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) period, he developed thrombotic occlusion of the RCA resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and ventricular dysfunction, requiring extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation rather than CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After confirming this complication by cardiac catheterization, the right coronary artery territory was revascularized with a pedicled right internal thoracic artery graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The entire procedure was performed on a beating heart using a stabilizer during ECLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This strategy may be useful in situations with unstable haemodynamics and a low risk of blood loss </plain></SENT>
