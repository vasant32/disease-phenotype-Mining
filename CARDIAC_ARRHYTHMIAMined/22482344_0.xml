<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> toxicity would be reduced in patient where <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> (BDZ) was co-ingested with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients who were diagnosed to be poisoned by ingestion of both a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-BDZ), and patients intoxicated solely by a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> were assessed, provided that they had one or more clinical signs of toxicity (anticholinergic, cardiovascular or <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> findings) and no underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> poisoned patients who had ingested any drugs other than <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients transferred from elsewhere and those admitted after the first 24 hours were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> toxicity and outcome of the patients poisoned only with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> (N = 60) were compared with those of the patients who had co-ingested <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCAs</z:chebi> and BDZs (N = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The frequency distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, "QRS more than 100 ms, R/S aVR equal or more than 0.7, RaVR equal or more than 3 mm", <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and generalized tonic colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was less in patients who had co-ingested BDZ with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluating the relationship between ingested <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> dosage and electrocardiographic findings (duration of QRS, QT and PR intervals, the amplitude of R wave in lead aVR and right axis deviation) in both study groups, demonstrated that there was a strong relationship between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> dosage and QRS duration in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was significantly different from the same correlation in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-BDZ group (r, 0.50 in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> group versus r, 0.04 in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> and BDZ group, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo>, non-cardiac pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: cardiovascular toxicity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> may be less in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-BDZ poisoned patients compared with patients intoxicated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>-alone </plain></SENT>
