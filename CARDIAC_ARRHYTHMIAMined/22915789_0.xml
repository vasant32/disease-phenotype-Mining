<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturers and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database on 13 April 2012 using the simple search terms 'Riata ST Optim™ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> analysis' and 'Durata <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> analysis' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lead implant time was estimated by subtracting 3 months from the reported lead age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MAUDE search returned 15 reports for Riata ST Optim™ and 37 reports for Durata leads, which were submitted by SJM based on its analyses of returned leads for clinical events that occurred between December 2007 and January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Riata ST Optim™ leads had been implanted 29.1 ± 11.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 15 leads had can <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> were caused by friction with another device, most likely another lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> resulted in high-voltage failures and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One failure was caused by an internal insulation defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Durata leads had been implanted 22.2 ± 10.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve Durata leads had can <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e>, and six leads had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> caused by friction with another device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these 18 can and other device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e>, 13 (72%) had electrical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low impedances identified three internal insulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Riata ST Optim™ and Durata <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads have failed due to insulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Optim™ did not prevent these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasions</z:e>, which developed ≤ 4 years after implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Studies are needed to determine the incidence of these failures and their clinical implications </plain></SENT>
