<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This compound is the fragment of fourth loop of nerve growth factor (NGF) and manifests antagonistic activity in respect to TrkA receptor, that specified for NGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is shown that this compound is able to significantly increase the threshold of electrical <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> of the heart and its effectiveness is not inferior to the reference antiarrhythmics I and III class on Vaughan Williams classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the latter, antifibrillatory action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> GK-1 was delayed and realized within 40-60 minutes after its administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is discussed possible mechanisms underlying antifibrillatory action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> GK-1, that, to some extent, may be associated with its ability to change the reactivity of beta-adrenergic structures of the heart </plain></SENT>
