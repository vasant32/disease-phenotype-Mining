<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic relevance of CyPA expression in endomyocardial biopsies of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 227 unselected patients (age 53.9 Â± 15 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> undergoing endomyocardial biopsy for diagnostic reasons were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were analysed using established histopathological and immunohistological criteria together with CyPA staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Virus genome was studied by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CyPA was significantly enhanced in patients with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 127) as compared with patients with non-inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (n = 100, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 16.3 months, 60 patients (26.4%) reached the primary endpoint, a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, heart transplantation, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-related rehospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical (ejection fraction, New York Heart Association functional class), laboratory (brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>), and immunohistological parameters (CyPA, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer, CD68, CD3, major hisocompatibility complex II, and virus genome) tested, only CyPA was identified as an independent predictor for the composite endpoint [hazard ratio (HR) 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.2; P = 0.019] as well as for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and heart transplantation alone (HR 4.7; 95% CI 1.1-19.8; P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analysis revealed CyPA as a predictor in patients with non-inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> for the composite endpoint (HR 3.0; 95% CI 1.3-6.6; P = 0.007) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or heart transplantation alone (HR 6.4; 95% CI 1.4-28.1; P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CyPA is an independent predictor of clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> undergoing endomyocardial biopsy </plain></SENT>
