<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 32 anaesthetized animals, the relevance of ventricular remodelling for TdP susceptibility was studied by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> [0.025 mg/kg/5 min intravenously (iv)] during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in the presence (CAVB, n= 18) or absence [<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> atrio-ventricular block (AVB), n= 32] of ventricular remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sub-protocols, the possible pro-arrhythmic effects of timing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> administration: prior to (n= 11), or after creation of AVB (n= 9) and relevance of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="8984">SLS</z:chebi> pacing (n= 17) was investigated during IVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> was also given after AVB when the activation of the ventricles was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>: pacing (1000 ms) from the high septum (n= 7) or abnormal but fixed from the left ventricular apex (n= 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsade de pointes</z:hpo> inducibility was defined as reproducible (â‰¥ 3 times) occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (AAVB), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> did not induce TdP spontaneously (0 of 32), whereas TdP was seen in 10 out of 18 serially tested dogs in CAVB (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other factors: timing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> (0 of 11 vs. 0 of 9), <z:chebi fb="5" ids="8984">SLS</z:chebi> pacing (0 of 17 vs. 1 of 17), or ventricular activation (0 of 7 vs. 0 of 5) did not increase TdP susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beat-to-beat variability of repolarization increased after ventricular remodelling and was highest prior to TdP induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In AAVB dogs, TdP is not spontaneously seen, whereas it is present in CAVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This implies that ventricular remodelling is a prerequisite for TdP induction in this model </plain></SENT>
