<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite this, there is a significant body of evidence from experimental and clinical studies, demonstrating that the vagus nerve has an anti-arrhythmic action, protecting against induced and spontaneously occurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 100Â years ago Einbrodt first demonstrated that direct cervical VNS significantly increased the threshold for experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large body of evidence has subsequently been collected supporting the existence of an anti-arrhythmic effect of the vagus on the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of prognostic indicators of heart rate variability and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity-measures of parasympathetic tone and reflex activation respectively-and the more recent interest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> VNS therapy are a direct consequence of the earlier experimental studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, mechanisms underlying the anti-arrhythmic actions of the vagus nerve have not been fully characterised and are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This review summarises historical and recently published data to highlight the importance of this powerful endogenous protective phenomenon </plain></SENT>
