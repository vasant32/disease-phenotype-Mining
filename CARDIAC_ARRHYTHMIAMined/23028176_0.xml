<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postal service evaluation questionnaires were sent to the lead physicians for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in UK hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospitals were identified by their inclusion in the 2008 Scottish <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Care Audit and the 2006 Royal College of Physicians Sentinel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 259 questionnaires were sent with a 33% response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Current practice regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> BP management varied considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of respondents lowered systolic BP within the first 72 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the majority (65%) delayed intervening for at least seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most would not intervene until systolic BP exceeded 180 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those who intervene, the most commonly quoted target systolic BP was 160 Â± 5 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> investigation was similarly varied; 12-lead electrocardiogram recording was frequent, with further investigation being more individualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respondents, 87% expressed interest in participating in future trials of complex interventions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Current practice of UK <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> physicians regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BP intervention is diverse, reflecting conflicting evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is interest in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> community for further research aiming to answer these important clinical questions </plain></SENT>
