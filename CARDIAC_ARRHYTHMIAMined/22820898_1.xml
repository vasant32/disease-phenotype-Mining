<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence of cardiovascular (CV) safety from randomized trials is based on studies of no longer than 6-month duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the CV safety of 1-year treatment with Selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> compared with placebo in patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The DECARD (DEpression in patients with Coronary ARtery Disease) trial assessed the prophylactic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> after ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty patients were randomized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> 10-mg daily or matching placebo for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial measures of CV safety including clinical and biochemical parameters, 24-hour electrocardiogram monitor, resting electrocardiogram, and echocardiographic assessment were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">Escitalopram</z:chebi> and placebo groups were comparable at baseline with regard to age, gender, sociodemography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score, risk factor profile, severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dropout rates defined as withdrawal for any reason or lost to follow-up during the 12-month study period was 27.2% in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> group and 23.4% in the placebo group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between intervention groups in any of CV safety measures including the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and episodes of ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, length of QTc, and systolic and diastolic echocardiographic measures at the 12-month follow-up between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 12 months, 16 and 13 major adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, recurrent ACS, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> revascularization) were recorded in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> and placebo group, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-year <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> treatment was safe and well tolerated in patients with recent ACS </plain></SENT>
