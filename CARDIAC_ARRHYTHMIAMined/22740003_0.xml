<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Women with germ line BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have a marked increased risk of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> compared with the general population, whereas risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) significantly lowers the incidence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to review the clinical and pathological characteristics of a French Canadian population undergoing RRSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical morbidity was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 1999 to December 2009, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women who underwent RRSO at our institution were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics, the Fischer exact test, and the Student t test were used for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, RRSO was performed on 119 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at surgery was 49 years (35-72 years), and 63 patients (53%) were premenopausal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two women (52%) had a history of in situ or invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were present in 34 patients (29%) and 42 patients (35%), respectively, whereas 43 patients (36%) were considered to have an increased risk of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, despite a personal genetic test, which was either negative (n = 23) or unknown because the patient declined genetic testing (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients with a uterus in place had a complementary hysterectomy (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six complications occurred (3 <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and 1 cystotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In one patient (0.8%), a high-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278686" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II ovarian cancer</z:e> was discovered at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fallopian tube atypias were identified on final pathology in 8 cases (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 22 months, 4 women (3.4%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and one woman (0.8%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is highly effective in preventing ovarian, fallopian tube, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> in a high-risk French Canadian population; and the surgical morbidity is low </plain></SENT>
