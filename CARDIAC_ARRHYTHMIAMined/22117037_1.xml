<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> indication are eligible for the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon inclusion, patients will undergo non-invasive risk stratification, including beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR), T-wave alternans, T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> variables, ambient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> from Holter, heart rate variability, and heart rate turbulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive or invasive programmed electrical stimulation will assess inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, with the latter including recordings of monophasic action potentials and assessment of restitution properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Established candidate genes are screened for variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, while one of the secondary endpoints is <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean follow-up of 3.3 years is anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive testing will be repeated annually during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has been calculated that 700 patients are required to identify risk predictors of the primary endpoint, with a possible increase to 1000 patients based on interim risk analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The EUTrigTreat clinical study aims to overcome current shortcomings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> risk stratification and to answer several related research questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial patient recruitment is expected to be completed in July 2012, and follow-up is expected to end in September 2014 </plain></SENT>
