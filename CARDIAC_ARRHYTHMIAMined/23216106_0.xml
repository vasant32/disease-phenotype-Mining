<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It results in a 5-fold increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF shares several risk factors and pathophysiological features with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence AF is often complicated by a variety of other cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) is highly prevalent among AF patients and associates with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of PVD within <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk scoring systems such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score improves risk stratification of AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, PVD has not been previously well documented nor looked for in observational studies or clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aim of this present review article is to provide an overview of the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (with particular focus on PVD) and AF as well as its complications </plain></SENT>
