<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biphasic pacing is a novel mode of pacing that was suggested to increase cardiac conduction velocity as compared with cathodal monophasic pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapid atrial pacing to convert <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multiple biphasic (anodal/cathodal), reverse biphasic (cathodal/anodal), and monophasic (cathodal) atrial pacing therapies were performed among 12 patients undergoing left atrial catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy end point was successful conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, and safety end point no induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were paced at three cycle lengths (100, 200, and 333 msec) for 60 seconds at three locations (right and left atrial appendages and coronary sinus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 66 biphasic (anodal/cathodal) pacing procedures one procedure in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF, which involved pacing at the left atrial appendage with a cycle length of 200 msec, led to conversion of AF to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 66 monophasic pacing procedures or the 66 reverse biphasic (cathodal/anodal) pacing procedures was associated with AF termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the biphasic pacing procedures was associated with induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid atrial pacing using a variety of waveforms at the cycle length and output used in the current study was found to be safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a single success in converting a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AF to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
