<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> on incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) and potential link to changes of myocardial connexins (Cx) 43 expression and distribution in MI rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine rats were randomly divided into three groups: Sham (n = 20), MI (n = 20) and MI + Val (20 mg/kg/day per gavage, n = 19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After eight weeks, the incidence of PES-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) was compared among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of Cx43, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the LV border zone (BZ) and non-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone (NIZ) were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Connexins 43 protein and collagen distribution were examined by immunohistochemistry in BZ and NIZ sections from MI hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> effectively improved the cardiac function, reduced the prolonged QTc (163.7 ± 3.7 msec. versus 177.8 ± 4.5 msec., P &lt; 0.05) after MI and the incidence of VT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> evoked by PES (21.1% versus 55%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor expression was significantly increased in BZ and NIZ sections after MI, which was down-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expressions of Cx43 in BZ were significantly reduced after MI and up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">valsartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased collagen deposition and reduced Cx43 expression in BZ after MI could be partly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9927">Valsartan</z:chebi> reduced the incidence of PES-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, this effect was possibly through modulating the myocardial AT1R and Cx43 expression </plain></SENT>
