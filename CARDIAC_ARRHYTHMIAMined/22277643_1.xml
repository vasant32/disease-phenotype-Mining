<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize the diagnostic challenges and clinical manifestations of a novel SCN5A mutation associated with BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From a novel SCN5A mutation (c.664C&gt;T; p.Arg222X) identified in a proband with the characteristic electrocardiographic pattern and the history of sudden collapse, 122 family members were studied including 40 carriers of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiographic diagnosis of BrS requires type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern in &gt;1 right precordial lead (V1-V3), but recently an isolated lead with coved-type ECG was proposed to be enough for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this family, these proposed criteria (PC) were more sensitive in detecting mutation carriers than the conventional criteria without repercussion on the specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriers had, on average, longer P-wave duration, PR, and QRS intervals and higher transmural dispersion of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of late potentials was higher in carriers, and individual signal average ECG (SAECG) parameters (QRSf, LAS, and RMS40) also were related to SCN5A gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three non-carriers were found to be affected by BrS, two with a spontaneous type 1 ECG with alternative placement of the precordial electrodes, and one only after the pharmacological provocative test, suggesting that other genes may play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PC for BrS diagnosis should be implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some parameters from the spontaneous ECG and the SAECG are more effective tools than the characteristic repolarization pattern to discriminate between carriers of SCN5A mutations </plain></SENT>
