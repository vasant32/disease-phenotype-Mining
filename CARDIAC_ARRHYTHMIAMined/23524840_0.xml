<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of pre- and postconditioning on ventricular arrhythmogenesis against controls with and without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats (n = 40, 269 Â± 3 g) subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (30 minutes)-reperfusion (24 hours) were assigned to the following groups: (1) preconditioning (2 cycles), (2) postconditioning (6 cycles), or (3) no intervention and were compared with (4) nonreperfused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and (5) sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> size was measured, and arrhythmogenesis was evaluated with continuous telemetric electrocardiographic recording, heart rate variability indices, and monophasic action potentials (MAPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a 24-hour observation period, no differences in mortality were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and ameliorated sympathetic activation during the late reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size by a further 35% (P = .0017), but only a marginal decrease (by 18%, P = .075) was noted after postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preconditioning decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and early reperfusion, whereas postconditioning almost abolished them during the entire reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted in MAPs or in the magnitude of sympathetic activation between the 2 interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to postconditioning, preconditioning affords more powerful cytoprotection, but both interventions exert antiarrhythmic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the latter, these are mainly evident during the ischemic phase and continue during early reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postconditioning markedly decreases reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during a prolonged observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic effects of pre- and postconditioning are likely different but remain elusive </plain></SENT>
