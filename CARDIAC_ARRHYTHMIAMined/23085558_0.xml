<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Desert dust, which is included in course particles, is considered to have potential toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect modification of desert dust on associations between anthropogenic air pollution and mortality has been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the independent effects of Asian dust are less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the effects of Asian dust on mortality independent of particulate matter (PM) in western Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained daily mean concentrations of Asian dust using Light Detection and Ranging measurements and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations (approximately PM(8)) during March 2005 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated city-specific associations of Asian dust and SPM with daily mortality using a time-series analysis targeting 1 379 052 people aged 65 or above living in 47 cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The city-specific results were then combined with a Bayesian-hierarchical model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Asian dust did not modify the effects of SPM on mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, Asian dust was adversely associated with mortality independent of SPM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The excess risk following a 10 Î¼/m(3) increase in mean of the current to the previous 2 days Asian dust concentration was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1 to 1.1) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 0.8% (95% CI 0.1 to 1.6) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, 2.1% (95% CI 0.3 to 3.9) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and 0.5% (95% CI 0.2 to 0.8) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of Asian dust were stronger in northern areas close to the Eurasian continent (source of Asian dust) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asian dust had adverse effects on circulatory and respiratory mortality independent of PM </plain></SENT>
