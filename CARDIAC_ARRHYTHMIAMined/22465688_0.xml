<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of iloperidone on cardiac ventricular repolarization at three different levels; in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(1) In vitro level: whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed on HERG-transfected HEK293 cells exposed to iloperidone 0.01-1 μmol/L (n = 35 cells, total) to assess drug effect on HERG current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) Ex vivo level: Langendorff retroperfusion experiments were performed on isolated hearts from male Hartley guinea pigs (n = 7) exposed to iloperidone 100 nmol/L with/without chromanol 293B 10 μmol/L to assess drug-induced prolongation of monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) In vivo level: ECG recordings using wireless cardiac telemetry were performed in guinea pigs (n = 5) implanted with radio transmitters and treated with a single oral gavage dose of iloperidone 3 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(1) Patch-clamp experiments revealed an estimated IC50 for iloperidone on HERG current of 161 ± 20 nmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) While pacing the hearts at stimulation cycle lengths of 200 or 250 ms, or during natural sinus rhythm (no external pacing), iloperidone 100 nmol/L prolonged MAPD(90) by respectively 9.2 ± 0.9, 11.2 ± 1.6 and 21.4 ± 2.3 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adding chromanol 293B, MAPD(90) was further prolonged by 7.3 ± 3.3, 11.5 ± 2.3 and 29.2 ± 6.7 ms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) Iloperidone 3mg/kg p.o. caused a maximal 42.7 ± 10.2 ms prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc(F)), 40 min after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Iloperidone prolongs the QT interval, the cardiac action potentials and is a potent HERG blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients are at increased risk of cardiac proarrhythmia during iloperidone treatment, as this drug possesses significant cardiac repolarization-delaying properties at clinically relevant concentration </plain></SENT>
