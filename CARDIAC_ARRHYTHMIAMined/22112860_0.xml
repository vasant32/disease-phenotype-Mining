<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Successful introduction of trans-catheter aortic valve implantation for selected patients with critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> has raised the question of how to identify appropriate high-risk candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the risk profile of patients undergoing single aortic valve replacement (sAVR), multiple logistic regression analysis was applied for open sAVR (n = 7,883) registered in the Japan Cardiovascular Surgery Database to predict surgical mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three subgroup analyses stratified by age, &lt;70 years (young), 70-79 years (middle), and â‰¥80 years (elderly), were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative patient characteristics indicated increased prevalence of several variables in the elderly subgroup including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV, 3-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (3VCAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following factors, however, were decreased in the elderly subgroup: dialysis, poor heart function, reoperation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 3.0% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sAVR patients and 5.2% in the elderly subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients produced 16 variables as operative risks (P&lt;0.05) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, dialysis, NYHA class III/IV, and reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis in the elderly subgroup produced 9 variables with more pronounced relative risk (RR), which included dialysis (RR = 5.4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> (RR = 3.3), preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RR = 3.0), 3VCAD (RR = 3.6), and emergency surgery (RR = 23.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: sAVR has produced good surgical results in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedure- and age-specific analyses have identified a risk profile that is unique to sAVR patients in the elderly population in Japan </plain></SENT>
