<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed retrospectively digital recordings of 121 patients (98 men; age 64+/-11 years) referred for radiofrequency ablation of persistent CTI-dependent AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median of mean AFL CL was 240 ms (interquartile range (IQR) of 222-258 ms, overall range of 178-399 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distribution of CL was not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (Shapiro Wilk test, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both counterclockwise and clockwise (14.9 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) AFLs were comparable in their CL; 240 (IQR 222-258) ms vs. 234 (217-253) ms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AFL CL&lt;200 ms and AFL CL&lt;190 ms was noticed in 5 (4.1 %) and 3 cases (2.5 %), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, age (increase by 6+/-3 ms per decade of age, p=0.036), treatment with specific antiarrhythmic drugs (increase by 11+/-6 ms, p=0.052) and the history of cardiac surgery (increase by 26+/-9 ms, p=0.004) were independently associated with AFL CL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, the distribution of AFL CL is not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AFL with short CL is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Short CL&lt;200 ms does not rule out the CTI-dependent AFL, especially in young and otherwise healthy patients </plain></SENT>
