<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: With improving surgical care yielding better outcomes, patients who have undergone a cardiac operation are surviving longer, and surgeons will inevitably face an increasing number of reoperative procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few data reporting risk and outcome for patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation in this clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1994 through May 2009, we performed surgery for AF in 245 patients (134 female) who have had at least1 prior cardiac operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 45 years (range 1 to 75 years) and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was paroxysmal in 161 patients (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most common cardiac diagnoses included Ebstein anomaly (n=43), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (n=36), and acquired valvular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (n=35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median prior sternotomies was 1 (range 1 to 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ablative lesions most commonly included isolated right-sided maze (n=123; cryothermy in 84, cut and sew in 39), biatrial maze (n=52; cryothermy in 26, cut and sew in 26), and right atrial isthmus ablation (n=41; isolated in 30, concomitant in 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 14 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>New permanent pacemaker was required in 39 patients (18%); indication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rhythm at late follow-up (median: 4.1 years, maximum: 17.2 years) was 89% in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and 78% in acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is common with a variety of pathologies requiring redo cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lesion set and energy source are dependent on primary procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Concomitant AF ablation during redo cardiac reoperations can be performed with reasonable safety and success </plain></SENT>
