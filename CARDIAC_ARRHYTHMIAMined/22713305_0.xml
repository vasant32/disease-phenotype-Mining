<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Early readmission in patients hospitalized for medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> is common, expensive, and associated with a worse late survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to compare late survival in patients' readmission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> with readmission for other causes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 3654 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a single institution between April 2004 and June 2010, 3492 (96%) were discharged from the hospital before 30 days and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival curves by readmission reason were compared using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analyses adjusted for patient demographics, known preoperative cardiac risk factors, and surgical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The readmission rate at 30 days was 13% (465/3492): 23% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, 12% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, 40% for surgery related causes, 14% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and 11% for noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for readmission include age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and cardiopulmonary bypass time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight percent (268/3492) of discharged patients died within the 6-year study: 14% in the readmission group versus 7% in the nonreadmission group (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who had been readmitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> had worse late survivals compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had been readmitted for causes related to their surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Readmission within 30 days after cardiac surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> predicts late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeted postoperative management may be warranted in patients with surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
