<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: High recurrence rates after complex radiofrequency ablation procedures, such as for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, remain a major clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local electrophysiological changes that occur following cardiac ablation therapy are incompletely described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether alterations in conduction velocity, action potential duration (APD), and effective refractory period resolve dynamically following cardiac ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Lesions were delivered to the right ventricle of mice using a subxiphoid approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sham-operated control group (SHAM) received the same procedure without energy delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearts were isolated at 0, 1, 7, 30, and 60 days following the procedure and electrophysiological parameters were obtained using high-resolution optical mapping with a voltage-sensitive dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity was significantly decreased at the lesion border in the 0, 7, and 30 day groups compared to SHAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APD(70) at the lesion border was significantly increased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points compared to SHAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effective refractory period was significantly increased at the lesion border at 0, 1, 7, and 30 days but not at 60 days post-ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that post-ablation electrophysiological changes take place immediately following energy delivery and resolve within 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ablation causes significant electrophysiological changes both within the lesion and beyond the border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Late recovery of electrical conduction in individual lesions is consistent with clinical data demonstrating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence is associated with failure to maintain bi-directional conduction block </plain></SENT>
