<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between an abnormal QRS|T angle and mortality in a nationally representative sample of subjects without clinically evident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 7,052 participants ≥40 years old in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with 12-lead electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with self-reported or electrocardiographic evidence of a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, QRS duration of ≥120 ms, or history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Borderline and abnormal spatial QRS|T angles were defined according to gender-specific 75th and 95th percentiles of frequency distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause (1,093 women and 1,191 men) and cardiovascular (462 women and 455 men) mortality during the 14-year period was assessed through linkage with the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analyses, an abnormal spatial QRS|T angle was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality in women (HR 1.82, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 3.14) and men (HR 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 3.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the multivariate adjusted HR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality associated with an abnormal QRS|T angle was 1.30 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.78) for women and 1.87 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 2.7) for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A borderline QRS|T angle was not associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause or cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an abnormal QRS|T angle, as measured on a 12-lead electrocardiogram, was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in this population-based sample without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
