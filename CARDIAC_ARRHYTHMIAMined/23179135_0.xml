<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> is more frequent due to an increased lifespan and improved health situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term outcomes in these women are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed 267 consecutive pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> who were seen at the German Heart Centre Berlin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study included analysis of long-term follow-up data after pregnancy and standard maternal cardiac, obstetric and neonatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The long-term data (n = 103) were acquired with a self-assessment questionnaire from each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main primary outcomes of the study included functional class, health, work capability and physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients at delivery was 27 years (range 17-43 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 11 years (range 1-49 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four percent exhibited complex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary long-term outcomes included good health in 61 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 68 % worked, and 76 % engaged in physical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three percent of the women who answered the questionnaire demonstrated a decrease in functional class during pregnancy, but more than two-thirds of these patients subsequently improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Secondary short-term outcomes included a 4 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriage</z:e> rate and a 4 % induced abortion rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The maternal cardiac data revealed that 30 % of the patients lost at least one functional class during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were observed in 12 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent neonatal complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo>, which was present in 12 % of the neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of the patients tolerated pregnancy without cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most patients displayed good long-term health, work capability and physical activity outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further prospective controlled studies are necessary to confirm these results and safely advise pregnant women </plain></SENT>
