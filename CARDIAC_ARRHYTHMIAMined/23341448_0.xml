<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Na,K-ATPase is specifically inhibited by cardiotonic steroids (CTSs) like digoxin and is of significant therapeutic value in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, new interest has arisen in developing Na,K-ATPase inhibitors as anticancer agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compare the potency and rate of inhibition as well as the reactivation of enzyme activity following inhibition by various cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> and their aglycones at different pH values using shark Na,K-ATPase stabilized in the E2MgPi or in the E2BeFx conformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of the number and nature of various sugar residues as well as changes in the positions of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> groups on the β-side of the steroid core of cardiotonic steroids were investigated by comparing various cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycoside</z:chebi> compounds like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>, digoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28544">digitoxin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28503">gitoxin</z:chebi> with their aglycones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results confirm our previous hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> binds primarily to the E2-P ground state through an extracellular access channel and that binding of extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> ions to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> binding sites relieved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e> inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This reactivation depended on the presence or absence of the sugar moiety on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTS</z:e>, and a single sugar is enough to impede reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, increasing the number of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> groups of the steroid was sterically unfavorable and was found to decrease the inhibitory potency and to confer high pH sensitivity, depending on their position on the steroid β-face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed with reference to the recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase in the unbound and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi>-bound states </plain></SENT>
