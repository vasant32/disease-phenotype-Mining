<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (CIONM) via vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is a new option for recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) protection during thyroid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of VNS for CIONM and to assess its effects on the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) through analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, nonrandomized controlled study 5 patients received VNS for CIONM and 5 were operated on with conventional intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HRV was analyzed in accord with patient-specific reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VNS resulted in significantly altered ANS balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative parasympathetic activity increased during VNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Yet, no relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or hemodynamic alterations were observed during VNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HRV analysis revealed a distinct impact of VNS for CIONM on ANS balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VNS caused parasympathetic predominance that was not countered by increased sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
