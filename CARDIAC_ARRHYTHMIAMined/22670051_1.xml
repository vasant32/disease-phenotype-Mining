<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relevance to human AF is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial enrolled 2580 patients receiving a dual-chamber pacemaker, who were older than the age of 65 and had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, but no history of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial noninvasive electrophysiological testing was performed over 2 years in a subgroup of 485 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the clinical characteristics between patients with and those without device-detected atrial tachyarrhythmias during the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias had longer paced (153±29 versus 145±28 ms; P=0.046) and sensed (128±46 versus 118±25 ms; P=0.06) P-wave durations and were more likely to have AF induced during electrophysiological testing (23.5% versus 13.6%; P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They had similar corrected sinus node recovery times at 90 bpm (388±554 versus 376 ± 466 ms; P=0.86), atrial effective refractory periods at 90 bpm (250±32 versus 248±36 ms; P=0.70), and rate-adaptive shortening of the atrial effective refractory periods (14±13 versus 12±14 ms; P=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the change in electrophysiological properties over 2 years between patients with and those without atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004071'>Prolonged P-wave</z:mp> duration, but not differences in atrial effective refractory periods, was associated with the development of atrial tachyarrhythmias in pacemaker patients </plain></SENT>
