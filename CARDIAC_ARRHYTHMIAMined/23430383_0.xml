<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few studies concerning systolic and diastolic functions of the left ventricle in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion is a sign for the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recent study found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients had an abnormally high P wave duration and P wave dispersion, markers for supraventricular arrhythmogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate P wave dispersion and its relation with diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed electrocardiography and Doppler echocardiography on patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum and minimum P wave duration were obtained from electrocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion defined as the difference between maximum and minimum P wave duration was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: No statistically significant differences were found between the patients and controls in minimum, maximum P wave duration and P wave dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the diastolic parameters in patients group, increased late flow velocity, decreased early flow velocity and prolonged isovolumic relaxation time reflected diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During 12 months of follow-up, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were documented in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> with diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JIA</z:e> with diastolic dysfunction has <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> atrial conduction parameters and therefore seemingly do not have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
