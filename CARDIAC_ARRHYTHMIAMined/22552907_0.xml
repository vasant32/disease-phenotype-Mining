<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this controlled human exposure study, we assessed the impact of exposure to concentrated ambient particulate matter (CAP) and ozone (O3) on T-wave alternans in resting volunteers without preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen participants without preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were randomized to filtered air (FA), CAP (150 μg/m3), O3 (120 ppb), or combined CAP + O3 exposures for 2 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded at rest and T-wave alternans (TWA) was computed by modified moving average analysis with QRS alignment for the artifact-free intervals of 20 beats along the V2 and V5 leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure-induced changes in the highest TWA magnitude (TWAMax) were estimated for the first and last 5 min of each exposure (TWAMax_Early and TWAMax_Late respectively). ΔTWAMax (Late-Early) were compared among exposure groups using analysis of variance.Results: Mean ± SD values for ΔTWAMax were -2.1 ± 0.4, -2.7 ± 1.1, -1.9 ± 1.5, and -1.2 ± 1.5 in FA, CAP, O3, and CAP + O3 exposure groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between pollutant exposures and FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study of 17 volunteers who had no preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, we did not observe significant changes in T-wave alternans after 2-hr exposures to CAP, O3, or combined CAP + O3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding, however, does not preclude the possibility of pollution-related effects on TWA at elevated heart rates, such as during exercise, or the possibility of delayed responses </plain></SENT>
