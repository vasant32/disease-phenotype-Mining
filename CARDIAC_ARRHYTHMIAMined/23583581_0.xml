<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with hereditary short and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndromes</z:hpo>, representing the very extremes of the QT interval, both seem to have a high prevalence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 281,277 individuals, corresponding to one third of the population in the greater region of Copenhagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These individuals had a digital ECG recorded in a general practitioner's core facility from 2001-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data on drug use, comorbidity, and outcomes were collected from Danish registers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.7 years, 10,766 individuals developed AF, hereof 1,467 (14%) lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Having a QTc interval below 1st percentile (≤372ms) was associated with a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.84, P=0.002) for AF, compared with the reference group (411-419ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the reference group and upwards, the risk of AF increased with QTc interval duration in a dose-response manner reaching an HR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.24-1.66, P&lt;0.001) for those having a QTc interval ≥99th percentile (≥464ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with respect to longer QTc intervals was stronger for the outcome lone AF as evidenced by an HR of 2.32 (95% CI 1.52-3.54, P&lt;0.001) for having a QTc interval ≥99th percentile (≥458ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large ECG study, we found a J-shaped association between QTc interval duration and risk of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This association was strongest with respect to the development of lone AF </plain></SENT>
