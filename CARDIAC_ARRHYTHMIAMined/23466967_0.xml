<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AF is increasing, which underscores the importance of understanding the therapeutic options available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in the primary care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article examines evidence for the use of novel oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (OAC) therapy, including the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the activated factor X inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy is the gold standard for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, its use is associated with significant challenges related to drug-drug and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food-drug interactions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> use also requires frequent blood monitoring to maintain anticoagulation within a narrow therapeutic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the novel OACs are as good as, or better than, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with AF, and they have a comparable or reduced risk of associated major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the novel OACs have fewer drug-drug and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">food-drug interactions</z:e> and do not require continuous blood monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Integration of the novel OACs into clinical practice offers patients with AF new treatment options, and as therapeutic use of the novel OACs increases, real-world experience will add to our understanding of the value of these agents </plain></SENT>
