<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is experimental evidence that increasing stretch increases the dominance of the pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) during AF in isolated hearts and ectopic activity in the isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, but the ionic mechanisms underlying such effects are not clear and the ability of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> to favorably host functional reentry during stretch cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a combination of endocardial-epicardial optical mapping with phase and spectral analysis to study stretch-related AF (SRAF) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> isolated sheep hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have found rapid AF sources in the posterior left atrium (<z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> region and their activation frequency and level of organization correlated with intra-atrial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the surfaces' optical mapping data in the phase domain reveals that activation of the <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> consisted of alternating patterns of breakthroughs, reentries and relatively simple waves swiping across the mapped field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patterns on the endocardial and epicardial <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> surface at any given moment of time of the SRAF could be either identical or not identical, and the activity in the thickness of the <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> wall is hypothesized to conform to either ectopic discharge or scroll waves, but a definite evidence for the presence of such mechanisms is currently lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the understanding of the manner by which the mechano-electric feedback effects in the <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi>, including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>, become important in the initiation and maintenance of AF requires further detailed investigation </plain></SENT>
