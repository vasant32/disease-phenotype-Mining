<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> reduces intercellular coupling by inhibiting gap junctions (connexins) and may thereby increase the risk of reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> on conduction velocity (CV) in atrial tissue from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and chronically infarcted rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Contractile force was measured and CV was determined from the conduction time between electrodes placed on the tissue preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of AT1a and AT1b receptors was examined by real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> did not affect CV in tissue from auricle or atrial free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transient 6.5 Â± 3.6% increase in resting tension was observed in atrial free wall preparations, indicating that receptors are present and functional in the free wall preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between free wall and auricle was probably not caused by differences in receptor expression since equal amounts of AT1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To test if <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) sensitizes the atrium to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>, free atrial wall from rats subjected to 4-5 weeks ventricular MI was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although CV was significantly reduced by MI, no effect on CV of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> does not acutely regulate CV in tissue preparations from the free wall of the left atria or the left auricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although ventricular MI reduces CV, this does not sensitize the atria to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
