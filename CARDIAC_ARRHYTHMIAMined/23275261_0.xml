<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinicians commonly rely on automated diagnostic interpretations for initial, point-of-care identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study goal was to investigate how one widely used computerized ECG analysis system performs in labeling prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: ECGs acquired in 2009-2010 from patients ≥18 years old within the University of Michigan Health System, analyzed by the Marquette 12SL ECG Analysis Program (GE Healthcare), and exhibiting sinus rhythms with heart rate &lt;100 beats per minute and QRS duration &lt;120 ms constituted our database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 97 046 study ECGs (48.2% from males), a prolonged 12SL-calculated QTc value (ie, ≥470 ms in females &gt;60 years old, and ≥460 ms in other sex/age groups) was displayed in 16 235 (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, for only 7709 (47.5%) of these ECGs with prolonged QTc did the automated interpretation include an accompanying "Prolonged QT" diagnostic statement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such prolonged QT under-reporting was manifest across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient environments and reflected algorithmic suppression of the diagnosis, attributable to ECG waveform-based criteria, in 8526 (52.5%) ECGs with prolonged QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the latter ECGs with prolonged QT diagnosis suppression, the computer declared 3588 (42.1%) "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath>" despite QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In evaluating an adult patient whose 12SL-interpreted ECG lacks a prolonged QT diagnostic statement (assuming sinus rhythm &lt;100 beats per minute and QRS duration &lt;120 ms), physicians should examine the actual QTc value displayed on the report before concluding that this parameter is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the clinical impact of prolonged QT diagnosis suppression by ECG waveform-based criteria is warranted </plain></SENT>
