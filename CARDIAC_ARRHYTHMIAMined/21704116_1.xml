<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is growing evidence that centrally modulated autonomic regulation can influence performance on complex cognitive tasks but the specificity of these influences and the effects of age-related decline in these systems have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recorded pre-task levels of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA; an index of phasic vagal cardiac control) and rate pressure produce (RPP; an index of cardiac workload) to determine their relationship to performance on a cumulative maze learning task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maze performance has been shown to reflect executive error monitoring capacity and non-executive visuo-motor processing speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Error monitoring was predicted by RSA in both older and younger adults but by RPP only in the older group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-executive processes were unrelated to either measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that vagal regulation is more closely associated with executive than nonexecutive aspects of maze performance and that, in later life, pre-task levels of cardiac workload also influence executive control </plain></SENT>
