<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has a potential carditoxicity with a relatively narrow margin of safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: This paper was designed to explore the mechanisms of Fuzi's toxicity and find out potential tissue-specific biomarkers of toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A myocardial lipidomics based on ultraperformance <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF MS) was developed to compare three cardiac <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> extraction methods and investigate the changes of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in mice heart of three different dosage groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we concurrently inspected the biochemical parameters in plasma, observed the histology of the heart and recorded the electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cardiotoxicity of Fuzi was dose-dependent, and the high-dose group obviously manifested the heart damage in histology and a certain degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant changes of 14 lipid metabolites which primarily involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acid</z:chebi> oxidation and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acid</z:chebi> peroxidation were identified and considered as the potential biomarkers of Fuzi toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lipidomics approach is helpful to search potential tissue-specific biomarkers and understand the underlying mechanisms of Fuzi toxicity on the heart </plain></SENT>
