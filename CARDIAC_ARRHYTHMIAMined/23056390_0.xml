<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TH imbalances alter cardiac performance and ultimately cause cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> typically leads to heightened left ventricular (LV) contractility and improved hemodynamic parameters, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> is associated with deleterious cardiac consequences including increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity, myocardial remodeling, and occasionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the long-term consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> on LV remodeling and function, we examined LV isolated myocyte function, chamber function, and whole tissue remodeling in a hamster model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-month-old F1b hamsters were randomized to control or 10 months TH treatment (0.1% grade I desiccated TH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV chamber remodeling and function was assessed by echocardiography at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 10 months, terminal cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and LV hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hyperthyroid hamsters exhibited significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> and deleterious cardiac remodeling characterized by myocyte lengthening, chamber <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, decreased relative wall thickness, increased wall stress, and increased LV interstitial fibrotic deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, hyperthyroid hamsters demonstrated significant LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the aforementioned remodeling and global cardiac decline, individual isolated cardiac myocytes from chronically hyperthyroid hamsters had enhanced function when compared with myocytes from untreated age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it appears that long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> may impair global LV function, at least in part by increasing interstitial ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or enhanced intrinsic cardiomyocyte function </plain></SENT>
