<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the coronary sinus (CS) and cardiac venous drainage is important because of its relevance in electrophysiologic procedures and cardiac surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several procedures make use of the CS, such as left ventricular pacing, mapping and ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, retrograde cardioplegia, targeted drug delivery, and stem cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result, it is more important for physicians interpreting the results of computed tomographic (CT) examinations dedicated to the heart or including the heart to be able to identify <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variants and congenital anomalies and to understand their clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of the CS range from anatomic morphologic variations to hemodynamically significant anomalies such as an unroofed CS, <z:mp ids='MP_0010440'>anomalous pulmonary venous connection</z:mp> to the CS, and coronary artery-CS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can be important to identify some anatomic variations, even though they are clinically occult, to ensure appropriate preprocedural planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both CT and magnetic resonance imaging provide excellent noninvasive depiction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and anomalies of the CS </plain></SENT>
