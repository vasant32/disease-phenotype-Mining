<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic reduction of KCNQ channel activity as a result of mutations causes various human diseases such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, discovery of small molecules that activate KCNQ channels is an important strategy for clinical intervention of membrane excitability related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a series of pyrazolo[1,5-a]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidin</z:chebi>-7(4H)-ones (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53262">PPOs</z:chebi>) have been found to be novel activators (openers) of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels through high-throughput screening by using atomic absorption <z:chebi fb="9" ids="33322">rubidium</z:chebi> efflux assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on structure-activity relationship (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SAR</z:e>), the substituted <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53262">PPOs</z:chebi> have been optimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-(2,6-dichloro-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)-3-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-2-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50127">trifluoromethyl</z:chebi>) pyrazolo[1,5-a]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidin</z:chebi>-7(4H)-one (17) was identified as a novel, potent, and selective KCNQ2/3 potassium channel opener by patch-clamp recording assay </plain></SENT>
