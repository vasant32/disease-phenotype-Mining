<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that most patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) can be safely managed in the emergency department (ED) without the need for hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The priorities for ED management of recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF/AFL include rapid assessment of potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> and identification and treatment of the underlying or precipitating cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A careful evaluation of the patient's history should be performed to determine the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients should be stratified using a predictive index for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (eg, CHADS(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For stable patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF/AFL, a strategy of either rate control or rhythm control could be selected based on multiple factors including the duration of AF and the severity of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If a strategy of rhythm control has been selected, either electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion may be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before proceeding to cardioversion in the absence of systemic anticoagulation, physicians must be confident that the duration of AF/AFL is clearly &lt;48 hours and that the patient is not at a particularly high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the duration of AF/AFL is &gt;48 hours or uncertain, rate control should be optimized first and the patients should receive therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after planned cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adequate follow-up of patients with recent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF/AFL is recommended to identify structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and evaluate the need for long-term antithrombotic or antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
