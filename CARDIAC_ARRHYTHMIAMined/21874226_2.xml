<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have established genetic defects as a risk factor for AF in a minority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is of substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the molecular determinants for AF in a majority of cases remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the entire coding sequence and splice junctions of GATA4, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor essential for cardiogenesis, were sequenced in 160 unrelated patients with lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The available relatives of the patient carrying an identified mutation were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional characteristics of the mutant GATA4 were analyzed using a luciferase reporter assay system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, two novel heterozygous GATA4 mutations of p.G16C and p.H28D, were identified in 2 unrelated families with AF, respectively, which co-segregated with AF in each family with complete penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis demonstrated that the mutations of GATA4 were associated with a significantly decreased transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings expand the mutation spectrum of GATA4 linked to AF and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of AF </plain></SENT>
