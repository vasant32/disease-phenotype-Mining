<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The preventive effect of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="8075">POA</z:chebi> has been confirmed by metaanalyses in adults, but less is known in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A metaanalysis of published trials was conducted to examine the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="8075">POA</z:chebi> prevention among pediatric patients undergoing CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant trials were identified from electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was determined qualitatively according to I (2) and chi-squared statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 121 potentially relevant studies, five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, resulting in a pooled total of 348 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with placebo, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> supplementation decreased the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after CPB in pediatric patients by 66 % (RR, 0.34; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.65; P = 0.001), with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between trials (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> P = 0.68; I (2) = 0 %) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the findings encourage the use of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> as an alternative to postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after CPB in pediatric patients, higher-quality randomized clinical trials are necessary before the findings can be generalized </plain></SENT>
