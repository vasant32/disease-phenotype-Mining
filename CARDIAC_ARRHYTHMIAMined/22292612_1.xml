<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intermittent ECG recordings may be helpful in detecting asymptomatic paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to compare short intermittent heart rhythm recordings with or without symptoms with continuous ECG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Twenty-two patients with diagnosed symptomatic paroxysmal AF participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients used a handheld transtelephonic ECG device for a 30-day period performing two registrations of 10 seconds per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally patients were asked to make registrations if <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> symptoms occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients also performed a 24-hour ambulatory continuous ECG recording during a single twenty-four hours period of the 30 day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AF was defined as an irregular ventricular rhythm without visible p-waves for at least 10 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1425 intermittent ECG recordings were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AF episodes were diagnosed in 18 (82%) patients compared with 7 (32%) patients using continuous ECG, (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with AF detected by continuous monitoring were also detected by intermittent recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the episodes, 16% were judged as symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term ECG registrations over extended time periods seem to be a more sensitive tool, compared with short continuous ECG recordings, for detection of AF episodes </plain></SENT>
