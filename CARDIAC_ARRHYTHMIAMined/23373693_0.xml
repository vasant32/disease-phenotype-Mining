<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the importance of contact force monitoring during mapping and ablation procedures is widely recognized, only indirect measurements have been validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real-time force values were measured using the force-sensing catheter and electroanatomical mapping system from 27 chambers (13 LVs, 6 RVs, and 8 epicardial space) in 17 patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular mapping was performed by the transaortic approach in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in 5 patients also by a transseptal approach with the aid of a deflectable sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> points were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of positive contact force during diastole: good and poor contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of good contact and its impact on electrophysiological parameters such as signal amplitude, local impedance, and frequency of late potentials was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The best cut-off value to discriminate the 2 groups was calculated by a generalized linear mixed-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5,926 points, 1,566 (26%) points were taken with poor contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In healthy tissue, categorical increase of contact force caused the increase of unipolar and bipolar signal potential amplitude followed by plateau </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of late potentials in the poor contact group was significantly lower when compared to the good contact group (11.9 vs 23.2%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The best cut-off force value to predict good contact during left ventricular endocardial and epicardial mappings was 9 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined transaortic and transseptal approach allows better endocardial contact during left ventricular mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ventricular mapping with sufficient contact force produces better substrate characterization within pathological areas </plain></SENT>
