<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since NOS1AP, a regulator of neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, was discovered in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as a novel target that modulates cardiac repolarization, several loci have been linked to the QT interval in studies (QTGEN and QTSCD) of European descendents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no GWAS of the QT interval in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a GWAS with regard to the QT interval in Korea Association Resource (KARE [n = 6,805]) cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replication studies in independent populations of Korean (n = 4,686) and Japanese (n = 2,687) groups validated the association between a SNP, rs13017846, which maps to near SLC8A1 (<z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/calcium exchanger 1 precursor, overall p = 8.0 × 10(-14)), and the QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs13017846 varies widely between ethnicities-0.053 in Europeans (HapMap CEU [Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe from the Centre d'Étude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Polymorphisme Humain collection] samples) versus 0.080 in Africans (HapMap YRI [Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria] samples)-whereas a MAF of 0.500 has been reported in Asians (HapMap <z:chebi fb="3" ids="5692">HCB</z:chebi> [Han Chinese in Beijing, China] and JPT [Japanese in Tokyo, Japan] samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This might explain why this locus has not been identified in Europeans in previous studies </plain></SENT>
