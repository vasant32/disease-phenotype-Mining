<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CIEDs are indicated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and therefore improve quality of life and life expectancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CIED can treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> that would be fatal without immediate care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, CIEDs raise several patient education, medico-legal, and ethical questions that will be addressed in this article </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information is a patient's right, and necessary for informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When implanting a CIED, the patient must be educated about the need for the device, the function of the device, any restrictions that apply postimplant, and postimplant follow-up methods and schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This transfer of information to the patient makes the patient responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occupational physician can determine whether a patient wearing a CIED is able to work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under current French law, patients are not prohibited from working while wearing a CIED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, access to certain job categories remains limited, such as jobs involving mechanical stress to the chest, exposure to electromagnetic fields, or jobs requiring permanent vigilance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pacemakers and defibrillators are medical treatments and are subject to the same ethical and clinical considerations as any other treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, stopping a pacemaker or a defibrillator raises different ethical issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator shocks can be considered to be equivalent to resuscitation efforts and can be interpreted as being unreasonable in an end-of-life patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pacing is painless and it is unlikely to unnecessarily prolong the life of a patient with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">terminal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a CIED should live as normally as possible, but must also be informed about the constraints related to the device and must inform each caregiver about the presence of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The forensic and ethical implications must be assessed in relation to current legislation </plain></SENT>
