<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Older patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cardiac conditions are more vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular conditions, prevalent in older people, are also the frequent cause of potentially harmful fall injuries among this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The need to identify the fall risk-related factors that cluster with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> is relevant as it will potentially reduce patients' risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and fall injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: The paper describes the process taken to design, develop and implement a practice-change initiative that specifically focuses on cardiac-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> and injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCESS: A review of best practice guidelines, related studies and patients' profiles from chart audits were utilized to obtain evidence-based information to develop this Assessment and Intervention <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo> Guide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the development of this guide, the charts of six patients were reviewed to assess specific data including age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, type of injury, cognitive function and underlying medical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The developed Assessment and Intervention <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo> Guide was utilized with seven patients in the Cardiology Unit who were admitted with diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> to assess their risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The project demonstrated an evidence-informed process that was used to design and implement this assessment tool and a change in nursing practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also provided information about the prevalence of cardiac-related risk fall factors that were utilized in the development of this Assessment and Intervention <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>Falls</z:hpo> Guide for elderly people </plain></SENT>
