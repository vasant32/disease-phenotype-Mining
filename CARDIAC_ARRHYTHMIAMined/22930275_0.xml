<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several clinical symptoms suggested that, in addition to motor neurons, the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems could be implicated in the cardiac function alterations observed in patienst with SMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These alterations were also found in a severe SMA mouse model, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and a reduction of sympathetic innervation, both associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigate the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> and the effects of a running-based exercise on the altered cardiorespiratory function in type 2 SMA-like mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed that the SMA induced: (1) a dramatic alteration of intrinsic cardiac conduction associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>; (2) a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> associated with extensive ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>; and (3) a delay in cardiac muscle maturation associated with contractile protein expression defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data indicate that the sympathetic system is not only functioning, but also likely contributes to alleviate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in SMA-like mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, physical exercise provides many benefits, including the reduction of cardiac protein expression defect, the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, the increase in cardiac electrical conduction velocity, and the drastic reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> resulting in the partial restoration of the cardiac function in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, modulating the cardiorespiratory function in SMA could represent a new target for improving supportive care and for developing new pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that would most certainly include physical exercise </plain></SENT>
