<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The markers of ventricular repolarization corrected QT interval (QTc), QT dispersion (QTD) and Tpeak-to-Tend interval (Tpeak-end) have shown an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their mechanistic relationship with SCD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study aim was to evaluate the relationship between QTc, QTD, and Tpeak-end, and the extent and distribution of left ventricular (LV) scar in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> at high SCD risk.METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 64 consecutive implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) recipients (66 ± 11 years, 80% male, median left ventricular ejection fraction 30%) who had undergone late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging prior to device implantation over 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scar was quantified using the CMR images and characterized in terms of percent LV scar and number of LV segments with subendocardial/transmural scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repolarization parameters were measured on an electrocardiogram performed prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders there was a strong association between the number of limited subendocardial (1-25% transmurality) scar segments and QTc (P = 0.003), QTD (P = 0.002), and Tpeak-end (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between the repolarization parameters and percent LV scar or the amount of transmural scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 19 ± 10 months 19 (30%) patients received appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, but none of the repolarization parameters were associated with its occurrence.CONCLUSION: In this pilot study there was a strong association between limited subendocardial LV scar and prolonged QTc, QTD, and Tpeak-end </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between any of these repolarization markers and the delivery of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
