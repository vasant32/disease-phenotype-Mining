<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-five European centres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the EHRA-EP Research network completed the questions of the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was an equal distribution of centres with high, medium, and low volume of activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common aetiologies were: post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> (55%), followed by idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (18%), and idiopathic VT (11%) and others (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in more than 50% of patients in 24 centres (62.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Invasive electrophysiological study was performed in more than 70% of patients in 16 centres (35.6%), between 51 and 70% in 9 (20%), below 50% in 20 (44.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 39 centres (86.7%), implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation was considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the setting of secondary prevention, early radiofrequency ablation of the VT was performed in more than 50% of the patients in only five centres (11.4%) </plain></SENT>
