<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with open thoracotomy for propensity score-matched patients with early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four relevant studies with propensity score-matched patients were identified from six electronic databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included perioperative mortality and morbidity, individual postoperative complications and duration of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause perioperative mortality was similar between VATS and open thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients who underwent VATS were found to have significantly fewer overall complications, and significantly lower rates of prolonged air leak, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients who underwent VATS had a significantly shorter length of hospitalization compared with those who underwent open thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In view of a paucity of high-level clinical evidence in the form of large, well-designed randomized controlled trials, propensity score matching may provide the highest level of evidence to compare VATS with open thoracotomy for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present meta-analysis demonstrated superior perioperative outcomes for patients who underwent VATS, including overall complication rates and duration of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
