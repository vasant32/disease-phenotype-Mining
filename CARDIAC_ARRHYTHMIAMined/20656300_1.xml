<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data are sparse on postoperative pacing in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of use and identify predictors for the use of temporary epicardial pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Perioperative data were prospectively collected on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution (n = 162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 117 (72%) patients had temporary epicardial pacing wires placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 23 (20%) of 117 patients had hemodynamic improvement with the use of temporary epicardial pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for pacing were slow junctional rhythm (11/23 [48%]), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (7/23 [31%]), pace termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (3/23 [13%]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (1/23 [4%]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> (1/23 [4%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By using univariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004133'>heterotaxy</z:mp>, the Fontan procedure, use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, pacing in the operating room, and use of vasoactive medications were predictors for hemodynamic improvement with the use of temporary epicardial pacing wires (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the Fontan procedure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were independent predictors (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with any of these 3 risk factors, only 2% were paced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinically significant pacing had longer chest tube drainage (P &lt; .01) and intensive care unit length of stay (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no complications associated with temporary epicardial pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Fontan procedure, use of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, and intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were associated with hemodynamic improvement with postoperative pacing and might represent indications for empiric intraoperative placement of temporary epicardial pacing wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients without these risk factors were less likely to require pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Temporary epicardial pacing wires were safe and useful in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after pediatric cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
