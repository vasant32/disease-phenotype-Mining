<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Postural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome (POTS) is characterized by excessive orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and significant functional disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously found that patients with POTS have increases in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>) that are twice as high as healthy subjects despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressures (BPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assess systemic and renal hemodynamic and functional responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> infusion in patients with POTS compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Following a 3-day <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-controlled diet, we infused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> (3 ng/kg per minute) for 1 hour in patients with POTS (n=15) and healthy controls (n=13) in the supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> study subjects were women with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ages were similar for patients with POTS and controls (mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 30±2 versus 26±1 years; P=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured the changes from baseline mean arterial pressure, renal plasma flow, plasma renin activity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi>, urine <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, and baroreflex sensitivity in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> infusion, patients with POTS had a blunted increase compared with controls in mean arterial pressure (10±1 versus 14±1 mm Hg, P=0.01) and diastolic BP (9±1 versus 13±1 mm Hg, P=0.01) but not systolic BP (13±2 versus 15±2 mm Hg, P=0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal plasma flow decreased similarly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> infusion in patients with POTS versus controls (-166±20 versus -181±17 mL/min per 1.73 kg/m(2), P=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postinfusion, the decrease in plasma renin activity (-0.9±0.2 versus -0.6±0.2 ng/mL per hour, P=0.43) and the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> (17±1 versus 15±2 pg/mL, P=0.34) were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease in urine <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion was similar in patients with POTS and controls (-49±12 versus -60±16 mEq/g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, P=0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity at baseline was significantly lower in patients with POTS compared with controls (10.1±1.2 versus 16.8±1.5 ms/mm Hg, P=0.003), and it was further reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with POTS have blunted vasopressor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> and impaired baroreflex function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This impaired vasoconstrictive response might be exaggerated with upright posture and may contribute to the subsequent orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> that is the hallmark of this disorder </plain></SENT>
