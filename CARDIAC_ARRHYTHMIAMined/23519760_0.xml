<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for drug attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incidents of adverse cardiac drug reactions are more common in patients with pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> to model differences in cardiac drug toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Action potential duration (APD) and drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>), familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM), and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease phenotypes were verified in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>, HCM, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> iPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single cell PCR confirmed expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in HEK293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic drugs as measured by APD and quantification of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have recapitulated drug-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e>, HCM, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> patients at the single cell level for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that healthy and diseased individuals exhibit different susceptibilities to cardiotoxic drugs and that use of disease-specific hiPSC-CMs may predict adverse drug responses more accurately than standard hERG test or healthy control hiPSC-CM/hESC-CM screening assays </plain></SENT>
