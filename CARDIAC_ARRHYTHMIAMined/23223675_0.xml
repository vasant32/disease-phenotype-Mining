<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e>) patients increases with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the influence of cardiovascular comorbidity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> patients on their short- or long-term prognosis remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the possible risk factors related to the short-term and long-term survivals in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> patients with cardiovascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One thousand one hundred and sixty-two consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> who had undergone a surgical resection between 1984 and 2010 were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 360 (31%) patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were analysed to identify the risk factors for postoperative complications and prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with cardiovascular comorbidity included 301 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 28 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 35 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, 23 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three patients exhibited more than one type of comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> rates were 3.6% in the cardiovascular comorbidity patients and 3.3% among patients without cardiovascular comorbidity (P = 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between preoperative cardiovascular comorbidity and postoperative pulmonary complications (P = 0.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rates were 1.0% for the cardiovascular comorbidity patients and 0.8% for the other patients (P = 0.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference in the postoperative outcomes was observed between the patients with and without cardiovascular comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates were 62.5% in comparison with 65.4% among patients without cardiovascular comorbidity (P = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were not found to be at increased risk of mortality and morbidity following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, cardiovascular comorbidity did not influence the long-term outcomes of patients after a pulmonary resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
