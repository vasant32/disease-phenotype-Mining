<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated muscle perfusion as a means of augmenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> discrimination by using implanted near-infrared spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hemodynamic stability by monitoring muscle perfusion from within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> pocket, in fresh tissue and inside the scar capsule on preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> generators, during induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sensor was implanted on or under the pectoral muscle, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> defibrillation threshold testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A microvascular oxygenation trend indicator (O2 Index) was computed during 74 induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> and 34 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm episodes in 34 patients and also during 28 atrial and 90 ventricular overdrive pacing episodes as simulations of supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, the change in oxygenation, based on the O2 Index, was statistically significant (P &lt;.003) from baseline within 3 seconds following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An optimized O2 Index, used for detecting the hemodynamic trend, exhibited a decreasing trend during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (P &lt;.0001) and was different from that during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was 100%, and the specificity for the rejection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm was 82% in the presence of scar tissue on the optical sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For a 35-mm Hg drop in the mean arterial pressure as the threshold for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e>, the specificity for the rejection of hemodynamically stable atrial and ventricular pacing episodes was 93% and 71%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An implantable near-infrared spectroscopic sensor may be useful for hemodynamic monitoring during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> to prevent inappropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
