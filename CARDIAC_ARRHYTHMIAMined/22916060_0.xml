<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (IVF) with <z:mp ids='MP_0010514'>fragmented QRS complex</z:mp> (f-QRS) and J wave in resting electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed data from 21 case subjects in our hospital who were resuscitated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> due to IVF and assessed the prevalence of f-QRS and J wave in resting electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the case subjects were classified among three groups based on the electrocardiographic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>: group I, both f-QRS and J wave were observed (n = 6), group II, only J wave was observed (n = 9), group III, neither f-QRS nor J wave was observed (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population characteristics, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), and circumstance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were evaluated among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of index events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, survived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes recorded in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) or pacemakers) was 13.4 ± 5.6 per-year in group I, 10.8 ± 3.9 per-year in group II, and 9.8 ± 4.2 per-year in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in incidences among the three groups, the most frequent index events were observed in group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for incidence was 3.2 (95%CI, 1.1-7.9; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The history and circumstance of the index events were different among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group I, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the index events occurred during sleep in early morning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group II, four subjects suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during strenuous physical activities or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> state, two during sleep in early morning, three in usual activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group III, one subject suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> during sleep in early morning, one in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> state, four in usual activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the IVF patients with the combined appearance of f-QRS and J wave in the resting ECG suffer an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, this subgroup of IVF patients has a unique clinical feature </plain></SENT>
