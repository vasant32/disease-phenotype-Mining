<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> later developed at 3 years and 8 months after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was hospitalized with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, general <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, and appetite loss one year prior to this presentation and died due to a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed the presence of 1,300 ml <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> and infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (LPL) cells throughout his entire body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LPL cells were found to have invaded the excitation conducting system in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an evaluation of a resected lung tissue specimen of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, subpleural infiltrated lymphoid cells were observed to show immunohistochemical positivity for IgM and bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although these lymphoid cells were initially considered to be non-neoplastic lymphocytes, they were later determined to be LPL cells, which thus induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and proliferation of the lymph vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>Chylothorax</z:hpo> complications in patients with WM are rare events and only six such cases have so far been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present case is considered to be an instructive one in which autopsy suggested the invasion of LPL cells to be involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
