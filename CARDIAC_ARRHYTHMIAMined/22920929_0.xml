<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported cases of WP (except in top-ranking athletes) family members have WP at rest that promptly converts to regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> with exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also have mild apical noncompaction that has been quite stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> of the structural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> disorders, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> was obtained from 4 affected family members in 2 generations for sequence analysis of the cardiac transcription factor gene NKX2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel frame-shift mutation (c.959delC) was identified that would result in premature truncation of the protein at residue 293, with loss of the C-terminal 31 amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness of WP to exercise, the long-term stability of the WP rhythm, and the mild asymptomatic structural features expand the phenotypic presentation of diseases related to mutations in NKX2.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of WP is reviewed in these subjects and in highly conditioned athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the investigators report familial stable WP and ventricular noncompaction caused by a mutation in NKX2.5 </plain></SENT>
