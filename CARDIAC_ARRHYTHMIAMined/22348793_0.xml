<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> in young patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is not supported by robust scientific evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, a pragmatic approach is needed to guide such therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims at standardising the diagnostic pathway for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients younger than 55 years of age with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>; elaborating a therapeutic algorithm; discussing every case in regular interdisciplinary counselling meeting; and setting up a follow-up schedule to assess clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a cohort study on the effect of a standardised treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoints include occurrence of recurrent ischaemic events, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and device-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints include drug- or procedure-related side effects, persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo>, and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 103 patients have been enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 51 patients underwent percutaneous atrial septal repair; of these, one had minor post-procedural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 25% of this group of patients showed a latent I grade shunt, one patient a latent II degree shunt, and none had a persistent shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 52 patients were addressed to medical therapy; one of them experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrences while on medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model of implementation of available evidence to clinical practice via a group-based, multi-disciplinary counselling provides a shared and coherent decision pathway and yielded a very low rate of recurrent events and therapy-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This approach could be replicated in specific protocols for other complex or neglected clinical problems </plain></SENT>
