<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi>-exchanger (NHE-1) is a key mediator for these detrimental cardiac conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NHE-1 inhibition appears to be a promising pharmacological tool for prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> application of the FO ω3-PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> (DHA) inhibit the NHE-1 in isolated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of a diet enriched with ω3-PUFAs on the NHE-1 activity in healthy rabbits and in a rabbit model of HF induced by volume- and pressure-overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: Rabbits were allocated to four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first two groups consisted of healthy rabbits, which were fed either a diet containing 1.25% (w/w) FO (ω3-PUFAs), or 1.25% high-oleic sunflower oil (ω9-MUFAs) as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second two groups were also allocated to either a diet containing ω3-PUFAs or ω9-MUFAs, but underwent volume- and pressure-overload to induce HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ventricular myocytes were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and used for intracellular pH (pH(i)) and patch-clamp measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NHE-1 activity was measured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46756">HEPES</z:chebi>-buffered conditions as recovery rate from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> prepulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results: In healthy rabbits, NHE-1 activity in ω9-MUFAs and ω3-PUFAs myocytes was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Volume- and pressure-overload in rabbits increased the NHE-1 activity in ω9-MUFAs myocytes, but not in ω3-PUFAs myocytes, resulting in a significantly lower NHE-1 activity in myocytes of ω3-PUFA fed HF rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The susceptibility to induced delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), a cellular mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, was lower in myocytes of HF animals fed ω3-PUFAs compared to myocytes of HF animals fed ω9-MUFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our rabbit HF model, the degree of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was similar in the ω3-PUFAs group compared to the ω9-MUFAs group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Dietary ω3-PUFAs from FO suppress upregulation of the NHE-1 activity and lower the incidence of DADs in our rabbit model of volume- and pressure-overload </plain></SENT>
