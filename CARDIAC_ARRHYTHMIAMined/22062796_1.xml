<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study explores the efficacy of endocardial CRT in more compromised hearts and the mechanisms of such beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Measurements were performed in 22 dogs, 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>, 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> combined with infarction (embolization; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and concentric remodeling), and 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (rapid pacing, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>+HF, and eccentric remodeling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A head-to-head comparison was performed of the effects of endocardial and epicardial LV pacing at 8 sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV activation times were measured using ≈100 endocardial and epicardial electrodes and noncontact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pump function was assessed from right ventricular and LV pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endocardial CRT resulted in better electric resynchronization than epicardial CRT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models, although the benefit was larger in concentrically remodeled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> than in eccentrically remodeled <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>+HF hearts (19% versus 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e>+HF animals, endocardial conduction was ≈50% faster than epicardial conduction; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> models, transmural impulse conduction was ≈25% faster when pacing from the endocardium than from the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic effects were congruent with electric effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endocardial CRT improves electric synchrony of activation and LV pump function compared with conventional epicardial CRT in compromised canine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This benefit can be explained by a shorter path length along the endocardium and by faster circumferential and transmural impulse conduction during endocardial LV pacing </plain></SENT>
