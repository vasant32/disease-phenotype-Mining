<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCD usually presents early in life either with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic crisis or as progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> that responds to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> supplementation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We extensively reviewed the literature and found that 15 of 42 adult published cases (35.7%) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were present in five patients (12%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient presented in her early twenties with a syncopal episode caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A positive <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> in the patient's child suggested a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> uptake deficiency, which was confirmed by reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> transporter activity and by molecular testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After starting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> supplementation, no further syncopal episodes have occurred and the QT interval returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
