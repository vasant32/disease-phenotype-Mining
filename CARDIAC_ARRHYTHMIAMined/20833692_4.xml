<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on the prognostic impact of comorbiditiy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy and defibrillation (CRT-D) are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of comorbidity on survival in CRT-D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 463 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients who received a CRT-D between 1999 and 2008 in Rotterdam and Basel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) is often used as an adjusting variable in prognostic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to determine the independent effect of comorbidity on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 30.5 months, 85 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates at 1 and 7 years were 6.3 and 32.3% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At least three comorbid conditions were observed in 81% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who died had a higher CCI score compared with those who survived (3.9 ± 1.5 vs. 2.9 ± 1.5; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An age-adjusted CCI score ≥ 5 was a predictor of mortality (hazard ratio 3.69, 95% CI 2.06-6.60; P &lt; 0.001) independent from indication for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, and from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interventions during the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Comorbidity is often present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients, and a high comorbidity burden was a significant predictor of mortality in CRT-D recipients </plain></SENT>
