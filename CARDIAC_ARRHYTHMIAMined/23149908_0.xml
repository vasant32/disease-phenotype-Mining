<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate is 72 % higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> than in the general population according to meta-analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality analysis has shown as many as 60 % of acromegalic patients die due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> may occur in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> may play an important role in this fatal complication; however, the precise mechanism is not fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion (dQT) is an electrophysiological factor known to be associated with a tendency for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate dQT as an early predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> commonly occurs in acromegalic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional case-control study enrolled 20 patients (10 female and 10 male) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> and 20 healthy controls (11 female and 9 male) after exclusion criteria were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each participant underwent 12-lead electrocardiography, including ≥3 QRS complexes, at a speed of 25 mm/s after a 15-min rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In each participant, the QT interval (beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) was corrected (QTc) for heart rate using Bazett's formula [Formula: see text] QTc dispersion (dQTc) (QTc max - QTc min) was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in median dQTc between the acromegalic patients (0.79 s) and the controls (0.45 s) (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Active acromegalic patients (n = 14) were estimated to have a median dQTc of 0.82 s, after excluding from the analysis six patients that were under full biochemical control, and that had randomly obtained growth hormone levels &lt;0.4 ng/mL, GH &lt;1 ng/mL based on oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IGF-I for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was noted in median dQTc between the active acromegalic patients and the controls (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dQT in active acromegalic patients was longer than that in the control group, which indicates that patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> might have an elevated risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We think that a non-invasive, simple and inexpensive marker-measurement of dQT-as part of cardiac monitoring could be valuable for screening complications in acromegalic patients </plain></SENT>
