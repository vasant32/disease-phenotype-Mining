<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Current pharmacological treatments to limit recurrent AF in patients with previous AF have limited efficacy and high rates of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of trials that tested the efficacy of n-3 PUFA provided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 586 outpatient participants with confirmed symptomatic paroxysmal AF that required cardioversion (n = 428), at least 2 episodes of AF in the 6 months before randomization (n = 55), or both (103) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to n-3 PUFA (1 g/day) or placebo for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was symptomatic recurrence of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between patients allocated to placebo and those who received n-3 PUFA for the main outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 56 of 297 participants (18.9%) in the placebo group and 69 of 289 participants (24.0%) in the n-3 PUFA group had a recurrent symptomatic AF (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.90 to 1.83, p = 0.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between treatment with placebo and n-3 PUFA for any of the other pre-specified endpoints, including the composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> development, or severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that occurred in 20 (6.7%) and 16 (5.5%) of patients randomized to placebo or n-3 PUFA, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 1.66, p = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological supplementation with 1 g of n-3 PUFA for 1 year did not reduce recurrent AF </plain></SENT>
