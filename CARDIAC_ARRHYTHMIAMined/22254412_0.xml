<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, cardiac models are useful for gaining insights into experimental studies, and in the foreseeable future they will be used by clinicians to improve therapy for the patients suffering from complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such models are highly intricate, both in their geometric structure and in the equations that represent myocyte electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these models to be useful in a clinical setting, cost-effective solutions for solving the models in real time must be developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this work, we hypothesized that low-cost GPGPU-based hardware systems can be used to accelerate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> simulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We ported a two dimensional monodomain cardiac model and executed it on various GPGPU platforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrical activity was simulated during point stimulation and rotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our GPGPU implementations provided significant speedups over the CPU implementation: 18X for point stimulation and 12X for rotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that the number of threads that could be launched concurrently was a critical factor in optimizing the GPGPU implementations </plain></SENT>
