<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Dual-Slope algorithm calculates the slopes on both sides of a peak in the ECG signal; And based on these slopes, three criterions are developed for simultaneously checking 1)Steepness 2)Shape and 3)Height of the signal, to locate the QRS complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The algorithm, evaluated against <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>/BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database, achieves a very high detection rate of 99.45%, a sensitivity of 99.82% and a positive prediction of 99.63% </plain></SENT>
