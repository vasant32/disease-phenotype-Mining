<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample was 100 children (55 boys, 45 girls), aged 7 to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A portion (n=65) was at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> due to having a parent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mood disorder</z:e>, and 35 were a low-risk comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using an impossible puzzle task, we assessed children's responses following failure across several domains: emotions (expressed anger, sadness, and negative self-statements), performance (being off-task, the time to solve subsequent puzzles, and the number solved), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> (heart rate, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that making negative self-blaming statements during the solvable puzzles and taking more time to solve the puzzles were associated with higher levels of self-reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0232604" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">rumination</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings advance the understanding of potential correlates of children's tendency to ruminate and may have implications for children's performance on cognitive tasks </plain></SENT>
