<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We intend to describe the incidence, management, and prognosis of postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> after AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> who underwent AF ablation in three high-volume tertiary care hospitals between January 2007 and April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 3,128 patients who underwent AF ablation during the study period, 25 (0.8 %) patients had postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and were included in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 58.5 ± 11.5 years with 18 (72 %) being males and 14 (56 %) having paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ulnar nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve manifesting as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meralgia paresthetica</z:e>, and femoral nerve were involved in 5 (20 %), 13 (54 %), and 7 (26 %) of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e> were associated with periprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (19, 76 %), and a quarter (19/72, 26 %) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment included warm and cold compresses followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and narcotic pain medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to the above regimen, in some patients (11, 44 %), oral gabapentin was used and it was associated with a shorter time to symptom resolution (9.4 vs. 14.1 days, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptom free within 90 days of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> after AF ablation is rare and is frequently associated with a periprocedural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients typically become symptom free within 90 days of the procedure, and gabapentin may have a role in earlier symptom resolution </plain></SENT>
