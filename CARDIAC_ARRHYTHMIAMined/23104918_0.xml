<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The human coronary tree is commonly assumed to have two roots: the left and right coronary arteries (LCA and RCA, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a third coronary artery (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) has been observed in humans and animals, usually arising from the right anterior aortic sinus near the RCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, we identified <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> prevalence and characteristics in rabbit and human hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Third coronary artery presence was analysed in hearts from 11 New Zealand white rabbits and 7 human cadavers, using excised tissue that was fixed, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-treated, and agar-embedded for imaging-based reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rabbit hearts and six of seven human hearts, originating either from an independent ostium (7 of 11 rabbits, 2 of 7 humans) or an ostium shared with the RCA (4 of 11 rabbits, 4 of 7 humans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> cross-sectional area in rabbits was 15.3 ± 6.0% of RCA area (mean ± SD, based on n = 9 rabbit hearts in which reliable measurements could be taken for both vessels), and 26.7 ± 10.1% in humans (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-but-one case where a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> was observed, it originated ventral to the RCA, progressing towards the right ventricular outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one rabbit, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> originated dorsal to the RCA and progressed towards the Crista terminalis in the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A fourth vessel, forming a separate aortic Vas vasorum was occasionally seen, originating from the right anterior aortic sinus either from an ostium common with (1 of 11 rabbits, 0 of 7 humans) or independent of (1 of 11 rabbits, 1 of 7 humans) the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pilot optical mapping experiments showed that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> occlusion had variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effects on rabbit cardiac electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Third coronary artery presence is common in rabbit and human hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Functional effects of disrupted <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> blood supply are ill-investigated, and the rabbit may be a suitable species for such research </plain></SENT>
