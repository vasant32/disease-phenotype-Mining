<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 14 underwent PMI and AVNA (AVNA group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients underwent PMI only, and continued to take anti-arrhythmic drugs (drug group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared cardiac function (cardio-thoracic ratio on chest X-ray, left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and left ventricular-ejection fraction by echocardiography), exercise tolerance (6-min walking distance), symptoms, and the number of antiarrhythmic drugs just before and 6 months after PMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, except for the number of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months after PMI, cardiac function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms did not differ significantly between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the drug group (p &lt; 0.01), the number of antiarrhythmic drugs was significantly smaller in the AVNA group 6 months after PMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent AVNA concurrently with PMI with RV lead placement at the mid-septum site for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> syndrome were able to reduce the intake of drugs and improve their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-related symptoms while maintaining cardiac function and exercise tolerance </plain></SENT>
