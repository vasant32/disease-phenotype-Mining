<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous access was obtained via right internal jugular for ablation and left subclavian for duodecapolar catheter placement into the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a posttransplant patient presenting with both regular and irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, both cavotricuspid isthmus flutter in the donor and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in the recipient was mapped using a two catheter approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful ablation of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and anastomotic block was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of successful ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus flutter and posttransplant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> using magnetic navigation via superior approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using only two catheters, this approach is logical and feasible in complex substrates with interrupted inferior venous access </plain></SENT>
