<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In 2001, Thailand implemented the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), a public insurance system that aimed to achieve universal access to healthcare, including essential medicines, and to influence primary care centres and hospitals to use resources efficiently, via capitated payment for outpatient services and other payment policies for inpatient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the UCS on utilisation of medicines in Thailand for three non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Interrupted time-series design, with a non-equivalent comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Thailand, 1998-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA: Quarterly purchases of medicines from hospital and retail pharmacies collected by IMS Health between 1998 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: UCS implementation, April-October 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Total pharmaceutical sales volume and percent market share by licensing status and National Essential Medicine List status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The UCS was associated with long-term increases in sales of medicines for conditions that are typically treated in outpatient primary care settings, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, high cholesterol and <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, but not for medicines for diseases that are typically treated in secondary or tertiary care settings, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of increases in sales were for essential medicines, there were also postpolicy increases in sales of non-essential medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediately following the reform, there was a significant shift in hospital sector market share by licensing status for most classes of medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Government-produced products often replaced branded generic or generic competitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that expanding health insurance coverage with a medicine benefit to the entire Thai population increased access to medicines in primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, our study also suggests that the UCS may have had potentially undesirable effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Evaluations of the long-term impacts of universal health coverage on medicine utilisation are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
