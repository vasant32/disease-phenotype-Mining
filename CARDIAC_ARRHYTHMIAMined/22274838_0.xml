<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects provided written informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced and cine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging were performed in 190 patients with IFG and 160 patients with DM without known previous MI to evaluate the presence and extent of late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement as well as global and regional left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MACEs were defined as cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the relationship between clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging variables and MACEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up information was obtained in 181 of the 190 patients with IFG (95%) and 151 of the 160 patients with DM (94%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MACEs were observed in 15 of the 181 patients with IFG (8.3%) and 24 of the 151 with DM (15.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was an independent predictor for MACE in both the IFG group (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.186; P = .003) and DM group (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.229; P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MACE-free survival was significantly higher in patients with IFG than in those with DM (P = .019, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the MACE-free survival curve for patients with IFG and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was similar to that for patients with DM and late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (P = .735) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of MI detected with late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is the strongest multivariable predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients with IFG </plain></SENT>
