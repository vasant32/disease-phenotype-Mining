<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disorder</z:e> characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG and occurrence of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> especially, but not only, under conditions of increased sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic untreated patients are at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve LQTS genes have been identified and most of them encode cardiac ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Very effective therapies are available and in carefully treated patients mortality is around 0.5-1% over 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial treatment should always involve β-blockers, with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7444">nadolol</z:chebi> being the two most effective ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With few exceptions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutation carriers should be treated because of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> during the first cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 20% of patients continue to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> despite the β-blockers and the most rationale next level of therapy is represented by Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation (LCSD), which is highly effective and can complement any other therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One important limitation of LCSD is that, without valid reasons, it is available only in a few selected centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whenever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> recurs despite LCSD, or whenever an aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> has occurred, it becomes logical to resort to the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter, however, is burdened by a high rate (31%) of adverse events including severe ones such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, inappropriate shocks, and by the need of frequent battery replacements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A scoring system, based on simple clinical variables, can identify the patients more and less likely to benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
