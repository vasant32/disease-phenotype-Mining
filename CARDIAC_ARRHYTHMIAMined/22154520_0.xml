<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous studies reported associations between insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) serum concentration and cardiac morbidity and mortality, but the association between IGF-I serum concentration and cardiac repolarization has not been investigated in a population-based study so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the impact of IGF-I concentrations on QTc, QT and RR intervals in two population based studies, The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and the Rotterdam Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 457 individuals from SHIP and 155 individuals from the Rotterdam Study older than 55 years and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IGF-I was determined by automated two-site chemiluminescence immunoassays and electrocardiograms were recorded by an ACTA electrocardiograph at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of IGF-I with QTc, QT and RR intervals was investigated by multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, body mass index, serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and calcium in both studies separately and in pooled analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant associations between log-transformed IGF-I and QTc interval in the single populations, whereas a significant inverse association was detectable in the pooled population (β, -15.6; 95%-confidence interval, -25.7, -5.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QTc interval was significantly higher in the first tertile of IGF-I compared to the third tertile (β, 5.4; 95%-confidence interval, 9.5-1.3) in the pooled analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The inverse association between IGF-I serum concentrations and QTc interval in our study is suggestive of a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and thus might provide additional evidence for increased cardiovascular mortality in subjects with low IGF-I secretion </plain></SENT>
