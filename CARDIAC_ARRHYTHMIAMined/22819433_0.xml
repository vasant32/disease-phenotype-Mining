<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The detection of undiagnosed atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AT/AF) among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors could be useful for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed newly detected AT/AF (NDAF) using continuous monitoring in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors but without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or evidence of AT/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NDAF (AT/AF &gt;5 minutes on any day) was determined in patients with implantable cardiac rhythm devices and ≥1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age ≥75 years, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> devices were capable of continuously monitoring the daily cumulative time in AT/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 1,368 eligible patients, NDAF was identified in 416 (30%) during a follow-up of 1.1 ± 0.7 years and was unrelated to the CHADS(2) score (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> [blood pressure consistently &gt;140/90 mm Hg or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> treated with medication], age ≥75 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of AT/AF &gt;6 hours on ≥1 day increased significantly with increased CHADS(2) scores and was present in 158 (54%) of 294 patients with NDAF and a CHADS(2) score of ≥2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NDAF was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, and 78% of patients with a CHADS(2) score of ≥2 with NDAF experienced AT/AF on &lt;10% of the follow-up days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval to NDAF detection in these higher risk patients was 72 days (interquartile range 13 to 177) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, continuous monitoring identified NDAF in 30% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with NDAF, AT/AF occurred sporadically, highlighting the difficulty in detecting paroxysmal AT/AF using traditional monitoring methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, AT/AF also persisted for &gt;6 hours on ≥1 days in most patients with NDAF and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether patients with CHADS(2) risk factors but without a history of AF might benefit from implantable monitors for the selection and administration of anticoagulation for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention merits additional investigation </plain></SENT>
