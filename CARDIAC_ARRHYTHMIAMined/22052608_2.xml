<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diesel exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to traffic-related fine particulate matter (PM)(2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although inroads have been made in understanding the mechanisms of PM-related health effects, DE's complex mixture of PM, gases, and volatile organics makes it difficult to determine how the constituents contribute to DE's effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that exposure to particle-filtered DE (fDE; gases alone) will elicit less cardiac effects than whole DE (wDE; particles plus gases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we hypothesized that spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats will be more sensitive to the electrocardiographic effects of DE exposure than Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY; background strain with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SH and WKY rats, implanted with telemeters to monitor electrocardiogram and heart rate (HR), were exposed once for 4 h to 150 μg/m(3) or 500 μg/m(3) of wDE (gases plus PM) or fDE (gases alone) DE, or filtered air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to fDE, but not wDE, caused immediate electrocardiographic alterations in cardiac repolarization (ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) and atrioventricular conduction block (PR prolongation) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in SH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to wDE, but not fDE, caused postexposure ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and increased sensitivity to the pulmonary C fiber <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> in SH rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only notable effect of DE exposure in WKY rats was a decrease in HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may predispose to the potential cardiac effects of DE and components of DE may have divergent effects with some eliciting immediate irritant effects (e.g., gases), whereas others (e.g., PM) trigger delayed effects potentially via separate mechanisms </plain></SENT>
