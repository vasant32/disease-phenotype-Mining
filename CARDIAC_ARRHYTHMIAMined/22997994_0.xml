<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now report the 12-month follow-up data in this prospective and randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 123 consecutive patients with persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation were randomly divided into an extensive AADs therapy group (group 1:62 patients using both class Ic and III AADs) or one AAD therapy group (group 2:61 patients using class Ic or III AADs alone) for the initial 2 months after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATa) was valuated at both 2 months and 12 months following ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first 2 months after ablation, less ATa were found in group 1 compared with group 2 (17/62 versus 29/61, P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no difference with regard to ATa at 12 months between the groups (21/62 versus 22/61, P = 0.799) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATa at 2 months and left atrial diameter (LAD) were the statistically significant predictors of ATa during 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While use of extensive AADs within the initial 2 months after persistent AF ablation decreases early ATa, it does not prevent late ATa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, LAD as well as early ATa is a strong predictor of ATa at 12 months </plain></SENT>
