<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Recently, the remote transmission of data detected by implantable loop recorders (ILRs) has become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate effectiveness and acceptance of remote monitoring in the clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> in patients with ILR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients implanted with ILR (Reveal DX/XT Medtronic, Inc.) and followed up by means of remote monitoring (CareLink(®)) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were requested to transmit the data stored in the ILR every week, via the CareLink system, or more frequently during the first period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient acceptance of ILR was evaluated by means of a questionnaire concerning physical and mental components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients (27 males, average age 64 ± 19 years) were enrolled and followed up for 20 ± 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (68%) had at least one ECG recording of a true relevant event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time from ILR implantation to the first true relevant ECG was 28 ± 49 days, which was 71 ± 17 days less than in the clinical practice of 3-monthly in-office follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients (81%) had at least one false arrhythmic event, mainly false <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> and false fast <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the absence of Carelink transmission, at least one episode of memory saturation of ILR would have occurred in 21 patients (45%) that would have limited the diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patient compliance was good even though one-fifth had some minor psychological concern regarding the ILR implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CareLink was well accepted and judged easy to use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring enhances the diagnostic effectiveness of Reveal, limiting the risk of memory saturation due to the high number of false detections and reducing the time to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both ILR and CareLink were well accepted and well tolerated by the patients, as they were considered useful </plain></SENT>
