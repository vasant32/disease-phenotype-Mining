<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 10 different twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded on different days for each patient to identify the presence of ER, which was defined as J-point elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV in inferior (II, III, aVf) or lateral leads (I, aVL, V4-6) in 49 individuals (46 males, 46±13 years) with a type 1 ECG of BrS and previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ER was observed persistently (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ECGs) in 15 patients (31%, P group), intermittently (at least one, but not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ECGs) in 16 patients (33%, I group), and not observed in 18 patients (37%, N group), yielding an overall ER incidence of 63% (31/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow up period (7.7 years), recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients (100%) with P group, and less in 12 patients (75%) with I group and in 8 patients (44%) with N group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Kaplan-Meier analysis, P group showed a worse prognosis than N group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(p=0.0001) Either persistent or intermittent ER in infero-lateral lead was an independent predictor of fatal arrhythmic events (Hazard Ratio, 4.88; 95% CI, 2.02 to 12.7, p=0.0004, 2.50; 95%CI, 1.03-6.43, p=0.043, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ER in infero-lateral leads was high, and especially persistent form of ER was associated with a worse outcome in BrS patients with documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
