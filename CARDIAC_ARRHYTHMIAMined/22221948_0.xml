<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to use retrospective cardiac magnetic resonance data to determine the relation between SPC flow and palliative stage and clinical status in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 116 patients, 78 were after Fontan operation (median age 19 years) and 38 were at an earlier palliative stage (median age 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SPC flow was quantified as aortic flow minus total caval flow or total pulmonary vein flow minus total branch pulmonary artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median SPC flow/body surface area (BSA) was higher in the pre-Fontan group (1.06 vs 0.43 L/min/m(2), p &lt;0.0001) and decreased nonlinearly with increasing age after the Fontan operation (r(2) = 0.17, p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the Fontan group, patients in the highest quartile of SPC flow had larger ventricular end-diastolic volume/BSA (p &lt;0.0001) and were older at the time of Fontan surgery (p = 0.04), but SPC flow/BSA was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> symptoms, atrial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve regurgitation</z:mp>, the ventricular ejection fraction, or peak oxygen consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (n = 116), higher SPC flow was independently associated with pre-Fontan status, unilateral branch <z:hpo ids='HP_0004415'>pulmonary artery stenosis</z:hpo>, a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004383'>hypoplastic left-heart</z:hpo> syndrome, and previous catheter occlusion of SPCs (model r(2) = 0.37, p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this cross-sectional study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single-ventricle</z:hpo> patients, BSA-adjusted SPC flow was highest in pre-Fontan patients and decreased after the Fontan operation with minimal clinical correlates aside from ventricular dilation </plain></SENT>
