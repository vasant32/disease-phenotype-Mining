<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) is a ubiquitin ligase/cochaperone critical for the maintenance of cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking CHIP (CHIP-/-) suffer decreased survival, enhanced myocardial injury and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls following challenge with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">cardiac ischaemia</z:e> reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence implicates a role for CHIP in chaperone-assisted selective autophagy, a process that is associated with exercise-induced cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether CHIP is involved in cardiac autophagy, we challenged CHIP-/- mice with voluntary exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CHIP-/- mice respond to exercise with an enhanced autophagic response that is associated with an exaggerated <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No impairment of function was identified in the CHIP-/- mice by serial echocardiography over the 5 weeks of running, indicating that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp> was physiologic not pathologic in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was further determined that CHIP plays a role in inhibiting Akt signalling and autophagy determined by autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes and in the intact heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, cardiac CHIP appears to play a role in regulating autophagy during the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, possibly by its role in supporting Akt signalling, induced by voluntary running in vivo </plain></SENT>
