<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prolonged ventricular repolarization duration confers increased risk for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to clarify the optimal method of QT/JT interval assessment in patients with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study patients (n = 71) were dual-chamber device recipients with baseline left or right <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> who preserved intrinsic ventricular activation during incremental atrial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified according to the presence or not of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The former group received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QT and JT intervals were recorded at baseline heart rate of 51 Â± 4 beats/min and during atrial pacing at 60, 80, and 100 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used linear mixed-effects models to assess the effect of heart rate on the derived QTc and JTc values with the use of six different heart rate correction formulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heart rate had a significant effect on the QTc and the JTc intervals regardless of the correction formula used (P &lt; 0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> formulae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The formula of Hodges demonstrated the least variability in QTc and JTc measurements across the different heart rates in both patients groups without (F = 15.05 and F = 13.53, respectively) and with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (F = 5.71 and F = 7.69, respectively), followed by the Nomogram and Framingham methods, whereas the uncorrected QT and JT intervals showed comparable heart rate-dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The application of Bazett's JTc and QTc led to the most pronounced interval variations in any case with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Hodges, Nomogram and Framingham correction methods provide best assessment of QT/JT intervals in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, whereas Bazett's formula exaggerates heart rate-dependency of ventricular repolarization intervals </plain></SENT>
