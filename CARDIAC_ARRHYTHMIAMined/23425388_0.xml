<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that myocardial calpain triggers caspase-3 activation and myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, whereas the inhibition of calpain activity down-regulates myocardial caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, our aim was to explore whether the Hsp90/Akt signaling pathway plays a role in the induction of myocardial calpain activity, caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the septic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male C57 mice were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS, 4 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, myocardial caspase-3 activity and the levels of Hsp90/p-Akt (phospho-Akt) proteins were detected, and apoptotic cells were assessed by performing the TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the septic mice, there was an increase in myocardial calpain and caspase-3 activity in addition to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells; however, there was a time-dependent decrease in myocardial Hsp90/p-Akt protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor-ле or PD150606) prevented the LPS-induced degradation of myocardial Hsp90/p-Akt protein and its expression in cardiomyocytes in addition to inhibiting myocardial caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of Hsp90 by pretreatment with 17-AAG induced p-Akt degradation, and the inhibition of Akt activity by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> resulted in caspase-3 activation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> C57 murine heart tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial calpain induces myocardial caspase-3 activation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in septic mice via the activation of the Hsp90/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
