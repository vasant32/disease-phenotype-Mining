<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a better strategy, strong, globally resetting electrical shocks remain the only reliable treatment for cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we establish the relationship between the response of the tissue to an electric field and the spatial distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in the scale-free coronary vascular structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that in response to a pulsed electric field, E, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> serve as nucleation sites for the generation of intramural electrical waves with a source density ρ(E) and a characteristic time, τ, for tissue depolarization that obeys the power law τ ∝ E(α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These intramural wave sources permit targeting of electrical turbulence near the cores of the vortices of electrical activity that drive complex fibrillatory dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show in vitro that simultaneous and direct access to multiple vortex cores results in rapid synchronization of cardiac tissue and therefore, efficient termination of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using this control strategy, we demonstrate low-energy termination of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results give new insights into the mechanisms and dynamics underlying the control of spatio-temporal chaos in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> excitable media and provide new research perspectives towards alternative, life-saving low-energy defibrillation techniques </plain></SENT>
