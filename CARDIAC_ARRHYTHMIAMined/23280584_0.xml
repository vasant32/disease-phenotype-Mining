<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 6 min electric field strength that the female workers were exposed to was 64.0 ± 25.2 V/m (mean ± SD), which exceeded 61 V/m, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection reference root mean square levels for occupational exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A statistical difference was observed between the exposed group and the control group in terms of the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> (χ(2)  = 11.48, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When several known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> were considered, including smoking, age, alcohol ingestion habit, and so on, the exposure duration was not an effective factor for ECG changes, sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> according to α = 0.05, while P = 0.052 for sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was very close to 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not find any statistical difference in heart rate, duration of the QRS wave (ventricular depolarization), or corrected QT intervals (between the start of the Q wave and end of the T wave) between the exposed and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occupational exposure to radiofrequency radiation was not found to be a cause of ECG changes after consideration of the confounding factors </plain></SENT>
