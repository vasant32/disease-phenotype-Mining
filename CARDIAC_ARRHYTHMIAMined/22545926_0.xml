<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> can appear with a variety of symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from vague to pronounced and handicapping symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) concerning symptom burden are important to assess and take into consideration in the care and treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main purpose was to develop and validate a disease-specific questionnaire evaluating symptom burden in patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review was conducted and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identified symptoms were evaluated by an expert panel consisting of cardiologists and nurses working daily with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SF-36 and Symptoms Checklist (SCL) were used in the validation of the new questionnaire <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>-Specific questionnaire in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>Tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> (ASTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homogeneity was evaluated with Spearman's correlations and Cronbach's alpha coefficient (α) was used to evaluate internal consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Construct validity was evaluated using item-total correlations and convergent and discriminant validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this, Spearman's correlations were calculated between the ASTA symptom scale, SCL and SF-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Concurrent validity was validated by Spearman's correlations between the ASTA symptom scale and SCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The correlations between the different items in the ASTA symptom scale showed generally sufficient homogeneity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cronbach's coefficient was found to be satisfactory (α = 0.80; lower bound 95% CI for α = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Construct validity was supported by item-total correlations where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> items in the symptom scale were sufficiently correlated (≥0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Convergent and discriminant validity was supported by the higher correlations to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-specific SCL compared to the generic SF-36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Concurrent validity was evaluated and there were sufficiently, but not extremely strong correlations found between the ASTA symptom scale and SCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The nine items of the ASTA symptom scale were found to have good psychometric properties in patients with different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients suffer from both frequent and disabling symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The validated ASTA questionnaire can be an important contribution to PROs regarding symptom burden in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
