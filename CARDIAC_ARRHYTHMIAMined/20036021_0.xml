<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CDSs are generally characterized by variable degrees of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> that may corrrelate with clinical disease activity (relapse, progression etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the clinical setting, enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> as measured with increased levels of inflammatory markers may predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> via direct or indirect mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, substantial levels of inflammatory markers including pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with CDSs may serve as potential contributors to arrhythmogenesis indicating the possible link between disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk in patients with CDSs </plain></SENT>
