<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if a combination of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and an iron-chelating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi>, which reduces the production of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18248">ferrum</z:chebi>-catalyzed reactions, can exert a protective action against reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two young male farm pigs were anesthetized and subjected to 45 mins of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 3 and a half hours of reperfusion, in the left circumflex coronary artery territory, via the inflation and deflation of an angioplasty balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly assigned to receive either an intravenous infusion of 100 mg/ kg <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and 60 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> (treatment group, TG) or an equal amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (control group, CG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The I/R ratio, the ratio of the infarcted (necrotic) zone (I) to the myocardial area at risk (R) after 3 and a half hours of reperfusion, was calculated using the tetrazolium staining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), number of episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, TIMI flow in the reperfused vessel, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were evaluated within the first hour post reperfusion in order to assess further injury severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the I/R between the TG (27.9 ± 2.2%) and the CG (32.9 ± 2.4%) (p=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups there was a significant reduction in LVEF (-11.6 ± 2.28% for TG and -12.0 ± 2.27% for CG, p&lt;0.01 for both groups) and a significant increase in LVEDP (+3.2 ± 0.9 mmHg for TG and +4.6 ± 0.9 mmHg for CG, p&lt;0.01 for both groups) compared to the baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was noted between groups (p=0.61 for LVEF and p=0.60 for LVEDP values, at one hour post reperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other parameters measured, no significant difference was observed between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous treatment with a combination of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and the iron-chelating agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> does not provide significant protection against myocardial reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
