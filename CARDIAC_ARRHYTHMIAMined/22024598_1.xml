<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear as to whether minimizing contrast use impacts adequacy of LV lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LV leads placed for CRT at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN from 16 March 2001 to 1 April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary goal was to assess risk of CIN and adequacy of lead placement depending on the amount of contrast administered during CRT placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> was defined as a ≥25% increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ≥48 h post-procedurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adequacy of lead placement was assessed in a blinded fashion by review of procedural fluoroscopic and post-procedural radiographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight hundred and twenty-two subjects were divided based on the amount of procedural contrast used into tertile 1 (&lt;55 mL, 257 patients), tertile 2 (55-94 mL, 261 patients), and tertile 3 (≥95 mL, 304 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> occurred in 5.4% of patients in tertile 1, 5.4% in tertile 2 and 11.8% in tertile 3 (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the tertiles, lead positioning was optimal in 95, 80 and 66%, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopic time was 34 ± 23, 42 ± 26, and 48 ± 30 min in tertiles 1, 2, and 3 (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Risk of CIN with CRT implantations was substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased volume of radiocontrast used for LV lead placement was associated with substantially increased risk of CIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minimal contrast use was associated with decreased procedural times without adverse impact on adequacy of lead placement </plain></SENT>
