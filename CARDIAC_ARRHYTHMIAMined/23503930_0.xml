<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine whether increasing heart rate via temporary atrial pacing is beneficial in augmenting cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 18 years who underwent cardiothoracic surgery and had no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients not paced postoperatively were atrial paced at a rate of 15 % above the intrinsic sinus rate (not to exceed 170 beats per minute, less for older patients) for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients paced for cardiac output postoperatively had their pacemakers paused for 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Markers of cardiac output were measured before and after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 60 patients who consented to participate, 30 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Failure to complete the study was due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (n = 13), lack of pacing wires (n = 7), junctional rhythm (n = 4), advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (n = 3), and other cause (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients were paced at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no change in arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference, mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, toe temperature, or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> with atrial pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Atrial pacing was associated with a decrease in head and flank near-infrared spectroscopy (p = 0.01 and &lt;0.01 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secondary analysis found an inverse relationship between mean arterial pressure response to pacing and bypass time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Temporary atrial pacing does not improve cardiac output after pediatric cardiac surgery and may be deleterious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future research may identify subsets of patients who benefit from this strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Practitioners considering this strategy should carefully evaluate each patient's response to atrial pacing before its implementation </plain></SENT>
