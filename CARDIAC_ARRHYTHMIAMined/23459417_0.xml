<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper we review two types of dynamic behaviors defined by the bifurcation theory that are found to be particularly useful in describing two forms of cardiac electrical instabilities that are of considerable importance in cardiac arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first is action potential duration (APD) alternans with an underlying dynamics consistent with the period doubling bifurcation theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This form of electrical instability could lead to spatially discordant APD alternans leading to wavebreak and reentrant form of tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factors that modulate the APD alternans are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second form of bifurcation of importance to cardiac arrhythmogenesis is the Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation that adequately describes the dynamics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of early afterdepolarization (EAD)-mediated triggered activity (Hopf) that may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The self-termination of the triggered activity is compatible with the homoclinic bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ionic and intracellular calcium dynamics underlying these dynamics are discussed using available experimental and simulation data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dynamic analysis provides novel insights into the mechanisms of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in the US </plain></SENT>
