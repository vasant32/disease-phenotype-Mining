<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: On the basis of the recently published human studies, this article not only focusses primarily on recent developments and current knowledge on the effect of marine omega-3 PUFAs on <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, but also provides a status for their effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Marine omega-3 PUFAs may protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and there is growing evidence for an effect of marine omega-3 PUFAs in the prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to establish which patients are more likely to benefit from omega-3 PUFAs, the timing of treatment, and the dosages </plain></SENT>
