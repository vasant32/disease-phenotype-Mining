<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular events are inconclusively associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> use in clinical trials and spontaneous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This analysis of cardiovascular events in relation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> use within a large health insurance database provides further data on the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cohort study was conducted within a population with commercial health insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> who initiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> were matched to separate cohorts of initiators of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi>, selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressants</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCAs</z:chebi>), along with untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and enrollees without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohorts were followed for cardiovascular events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100735'>hypertensive crisis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and coronary revascularization), which were identified through health insurance claims and confirmed upon review of underlying medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards and Poisson regression models were used for comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were approximately 64,000 person-years of follow-up among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cohorts (including 17,386 person-years among 21,457 duloxetine initiators), yielding 279 cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> initiators, those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had lower rates of combined events (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.81) and coronary revascularizations (IRR, 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IR of each of the cardiovascular outcomes did not differ across the other cohorts, even accounting for time since last <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> dispensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of cardiovascular events did not differ among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> initiators relative to other antidepressant comparators or those with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but was higher than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> itself (or associated morbidities) may affect the risk of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
