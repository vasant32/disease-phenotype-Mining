<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether human stellate ganglia remodel in association with cardiac pathology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether cardiac pathology is associated with remodeling of the stellate ganglia in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Left stellate ganglia were collected from patients undergoing sympathetic denervation for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and from cadavers, along with intact hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data on patients and cadaveric subjects were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We classified ganglia from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, scarred, and nonischemic cardiomyopathic hearts without scar as NL (n=3), SCAR (n=24), and NICM (n=7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within left stellate ganglia, neuronal size, density, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, synaptic density, and nerve sprouting were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nerve density and sprouting were also quantified in cadaveric hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean neuronal size in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, scarred, and nonischemic cardiomyopathic hearts without scar groups were 320 ± 4 μm(2), 372 ± 10 μm(2), and 435 ± 10 μm(2) (P=0.002), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in neuronal density and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were present between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Synaptic density in ganglia from SCAR and NICM groups were 57.8 ± 11.2 μm(2)/mm(2) (P=0.084) and 44.5 ± 7.9 μm(2)/mm(2) (P=0.039), respectively, compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, 17.8 ± 7 μm(2)/mm(2) (overall P=0.162) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in left stellate ganglia nerve sprouting or myocardial nerve density between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005603'>Neuronal hypertrophy</z:mp> within left stellate ganglia is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ganglionic and myocardial nerve sprouting and nerve density were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These changes may be related to increased cardiac sympathetic signaling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine the electrophysiological consequences of extracardiac neuronal remodeling in humans </plain></SENT>
