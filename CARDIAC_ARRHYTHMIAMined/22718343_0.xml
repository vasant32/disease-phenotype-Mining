<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The locus coeruleus (LC) is the main source of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> in the brain and is implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological and behavioral processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, genetic pathways controlling the development of noradrenergic neurons in the mammalian brain are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that Rbpj, a key nuclear effector in the Notch signaling pathway, plays an essential role in LC neuron development in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditional inactivation of Rbpj in the dorsal rhombomere (r) 1, where LC neurons are born, resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of Phox2a- and Phox2b-expressing early-differentiating LC neurons, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-Î²-hydroxylase- and tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing late-differentiating LC neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, other neuronal populations derived from the dorsal r1 were either reduced or unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a drastic upregulation of Ascl1, an essential factor for noradrenergic neurogenesis, was observed in dorsal r1 of conditional knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Through genomic sequence analysis and EMSA and ChIP assays, a conserved Rbpj-binding motif was identified within the Ascl1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A luciferase reporter assay revealed that Rbpj per se could induce Ascl1 transactivation but this effect was counteracted by its downstream-targeted gene Hes1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our in vitro gene transfection and in ovo electroporation assays showed that Rbpj upregulated Ascl1 expression when Hes1 expression was knocked down, although it also exerted a repressive effect on Ascl1 expression in the presence of Hes1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results provide the first evidence that Rbpj functions as a key modulator of LC neuron development by regulating Ascl1 expression directly, and indirectly through its target gene Hes1 </plain></SENT>
