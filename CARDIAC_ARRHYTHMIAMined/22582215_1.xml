<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of enhanced CSAR to sympathetic activation in the early stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the involvement of AT(1) receptors in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced by a single intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> experiments were carried out under anesthesia after 3 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSAR was evaluated by the responses of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to epicardial application of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> or bradykinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic activity and CSAR were enhanced in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> were increased, but the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in the left ventricle wall was not significantly increased in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pericardial injection of resiniferatoxin to desensitize cardiac afferents or PVN microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> attenuated the CSAR and decreased the RSNA and MAP in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The AT(1) receptor expression in the PVN increased in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi> in the PVN caused greater increases in the RSNA and MAP and enhancement in the CSAR in diabetic rats, which were abolished by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> decreased the RSNA and MAP and attenuated the CSAR in diabetic rats but not in control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the CSAR is enhanced in the early stage of diabetic rats, which contributes to the sympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AT(1) receptors in the PVN are involved in the enhanced CSAR in diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
