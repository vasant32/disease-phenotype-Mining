<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Observational analysis of a prospective cohort of hospitalized adults with CAP (1995-2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac events and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3921 patients with CAP, 315 (8%) had one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac events during hospitalization (199 new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 118 new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and/or 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with these events were age &gt;65 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, septic shock, multilobar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo>, and pneumococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A rule based on these variables had an area under ROC curve of 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These complications occurred in 2.8% of patients classified in the low-risk (≤3 points), 9.7% in the intermediate-risk (4-5 points) and 21.2% in the high-risk (≥6 points) groups (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall case fatality rate was higher in patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac events (19.4% vs. 6.4%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> cardiac events occur frequently during hospitalization for CAP and are associated with poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A simple rule based on demographic and clinical features may help identify patients at higher risk of these complications </plain></SENT>
