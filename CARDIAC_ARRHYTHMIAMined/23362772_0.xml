<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dynamic parameters such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variation (SVV) and cardiac index obtained by arterial pulse contour analysis may not be sufficient for fluid optimization because individualized optimal parameter values are difficult to determine in cardiac patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of abdominal surgery with severe pre-existing impairment of cardiac function (ejection fraction &lt; 30%) complicated by severe pulmonary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, because of unreliably high SVV values due to a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, we performed colloid bolus infusion targeting central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) above 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Case 2, cardiac index and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index remained unchanged despite the decrease of SVV after colloid bolus infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infusion of dobutamine was useful for maintaining the ScvO2 above 75% in a rather hypovolemic state (SVV of 10-15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our cases suggest that the use of central venous oxygen saturation together with arterial pulse contour analysis may aid decision-making for individualized fluid optimization and use of inotropics in severely compromised cardiac patients undergoing major abdominal surgery </plain></SENT>
