<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of subclavian venous occlusions (SCVOs) may be an increasing problem in the era of device upgrades, especially to cardiac resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venoplasty (VP) performed by the electrophysiologist as a way of managing SCVOs may be advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implants of the past 5 years at Montefiore Medical Center and searched for SCVOs that required intervention and compared cases where VP was performed with cases where it was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,853 ICD implants, 41 SCVOs (2.2%) requiring intervention were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its incidence increased seven-fold from 0.7% in 2005 to 5.2% in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of the 41 SCVOs were found during a device upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 41 SCVOs, 18 underwent VP and 23 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the VP group, there was a trend towards a shorter total procedure time, 2:31 hours versus 3:28 hours (P=0.37), and the total fluoroscopy time was 30 minutes versus 27 minutes (P=0.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VP was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the non-VP group (n=23), five (21.5%) had a failed implantation because of the inability to gain venous access and 10 (42.7%) had to be implanted on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of SCVOs requiring intervention is increasing in the era of device upgrades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VP performed by an electrophysiologist appears to be a safe and efficient approach to manage these SCVOs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VP seems to reduce the implant time and the need to implant on the other side as well as implant failure due to the inability to gain venous access </plain></SENT>
