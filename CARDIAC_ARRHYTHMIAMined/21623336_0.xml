<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The cut and sew Cox-Maze III procedure has proven to be extremely effective in curing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the relative complexity various procedures were developed to apply ablative lesions to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> using different energy sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we present data related to our experience with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">Argon</z:chebi> based cryoablation system in patients having first time concomitant CryoCox-Maze III procedure and other cardiac surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective study where <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing the Cox maze procedure are entered into our unique maze registry and are followed at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months and yearly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Health related quality of life (SF-12) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> frequency and severity of symptoms were obtained preoperatively and at follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rhythm was verified by EKG and 24 hour holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Heart Rhythm Society definition of failure (any monitored incident of an atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> &gt;30 seconds) was used to compute the rate of return to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ablative technique employed was <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> based crytothermia using only 1 to 2 atriotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of patients operated by multiple surgeons was 124 with 17% through a right minithoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality (&lt;2%) and perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (&lt;1%) were very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 12 months 87% of the patients were in sinus rhythm and off class I and III antriarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a clear difference in success rate depending on surgeon's total experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quality of life and severity of symptoms were improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The one year results of the CryoCox-Maze III procedure when performed concomitantly with another cardiac surgical procedure demonstrate reasonable safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, operator experience may be related to better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> may be associated with improved quality of life and symptoms relief </plain></SENT>
