<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Included were 78 consecutive patients (82% men; mean age, 61±10 years; mean left atrial diameter, 47±4 mm) with persistent AF who underwent ≥1 repeat ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial ablation procedure had consisted of pulmonary vein isolation with additional substrate modification (ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms [n=63] or linear lesions [n=15]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients presented for reablation either with persistent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) (group 1, n=36), persistent AF (group 2, n=37), or paroxysmal AF (group 3, n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was freedom from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> off antiarrhythmic drugs 6 and 9 months after the reablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Estimated proportions of patients reaching the primary end point were 59% for group 1, 28% for group 2, and 100% for group 3 at 6 months and 51%, 23%, and 100%, for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, at 9 months (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting for a repeat procedure after ablation of persistent AF, the occurrence of AT is associated with a significantly better outcome compared with recurrent persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that AT might be considered as a step toward sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
