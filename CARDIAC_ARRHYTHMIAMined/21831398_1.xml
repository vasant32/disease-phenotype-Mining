<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> is the most common therapeutic modality to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbations in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> have been reported during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to detect cardiac rhythm changes in patients with MS while receiving high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 52 consecutive MS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> relapse to perform cardiac monitoring 4h before, during and 18 h after infusion of 1000 mg intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>Sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> was the most common change in cardiac rhythms before, during, and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up to 41.9% of the patients, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> after pulse infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sinus arrest and sinus exit block were observed in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were observed in three patients and one patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, sinus arrest, and sinus exit block, were correlated with smoking and more commonly observed during 12h post infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>Sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were detected more commonly in patients with history of urinary dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> might cause different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in MS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smokers and patients with autonomic disturbances like sphincter and bowel problems have more chance to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> while receiving high dose steroids </plain></SENT>
