<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and OSA of mainly mild and moderate severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 486 subjects (mean age 49 years, 55% men) recruited from a population-based study in Norway underwent polysomnography for OSA assessment and Holter recordings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 271 patients were diagnosed with OSA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index [AHI] ≥5, median AHI 16.8, quartiles 1 to 3 8.9 to 32.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean nadir oxygen saturations were 82% and 89% in patients with and without OSA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventricular premature complexes (≥5/hour) were more prevalent in subjects with OSA compared to subjects without OSA (median AHI 1.4, quartiles 1 to 3 0.5 to 3.0) during the night (12.2% vs 4.7%, p = 0.005) and day (14% vs 5.1%, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis after adjusting for relevant confounders, AHI was independently associated with an increased prevalence of ventricular premature complexes at night (odds ratio per 1-U increase of log-transformed AHI 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.0, p = 0.008) and during the day (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.8, p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevalence of ventricular premature complexes is increased in middle-aged patients with mainly mild or moderate OSA, suggesting an association between OSA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> even in mild OSA </plain></SENT>
