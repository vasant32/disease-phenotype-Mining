<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Poland, annually are taken from 4.5 to 5.5 thousand <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">suicide attempts</z:e>, about 3.7% of them due to excessive consumption of pharmaceuticals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze patients who for suicidal attempts ingested drugs acting on the cardiac conduction system, and to study performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and obtained results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitalized in the years 1995-2010 in the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care patients after excessive suicidal ingestion of drugs acting on the heart conductive system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised a total of 40 patients aged from 15 to 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Suicide attempts</z:e> in the study group were mostly taken by the lonely people and by the subjects with disturbed adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were unconscious mainly after ingestion of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the 40-person group of patients after suicidal ingestion of drugs affecting the conduction system of heart eight patients (20%) required respirator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has not been shown that any group of drugs significantly more frequent induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> requiring mechanical assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rhythm and conduction disturbances during hospitalization occurred in 15 patients (38%), of which 12 (30%) required temporary endocardial stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study revealed the longest ventricular stimulation need in patients after consumption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure in half of the patients was depressed, and 15 of them (38%) required the use of pressor <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From the 40-person group 2 people died (one patient after ingestion of 4000 mg of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and the other after eating 6000 mg of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients who died differed from the other patients with in younger age, longer time elapsed since the consumption of drugs to their hospitalization, during admission they had undetectable blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, and decreased serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The remaining 38 patients (95%) were discharged from the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Attempts to take his own life with the use of drugs in the cardiac conduction system in the study group were taken by a lonely and adaptive disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used preparations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> were beta-adrenergic receptors blockers, whereas hemodynamic abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and conduction disturbances were observed more frequently after the drugs that block calcium channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In patients with life-saving use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">suicide attempts</z:e> important role in addition to medication dosage plays an elapsed time of their consumption and speed of action taken to remove and prevent absorbtion the poison", as well as close supervision in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
