<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) reduce mortality in selected patients at risk for life-threatening heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and their use is increasingly common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these devices also confer risk for delivery of unexpected painful shocks during the dying process, thus reducing the quality of palliative care at the end of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This scenario can be avoided by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> deactivation in appropriate circumstances but patients will remain unaware of this option if not informed about it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is not known how often end-of-life implications are discussed with patients prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, when focus is primarily on the short-term potential complications of the device placement procedure itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine how often end-of-life implications were discussed with patients as part of the informed consent process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated consent forms and related other chart documentation for 91 patients (ranging from age 60 to 89 years) undergoing first-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> placement at a mid-western academic medical center from 2006-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one chart documented any discussion of end-of-life implications, in a case where the issue was raised by a patient who noted that quality of life was their main focus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consent was provided by a health care surrogate in only four of the 91 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients giving consent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation may be uninformed about the device's potential future impact on end-of-life care, the dying process, and the option for device deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Truly informed consent requires that both short- and long-term potential implications be reviewed with patients </plain></SENT>
