<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or diagnosis of ARVC/D are reported to be around the 30-40s, the age-dependent clinical and genetic differences remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: A total of 35 consecutive Japanese probands (23 male) who were clinically diagnosed with ARVC/D were enrolled in the present study, and genetic analysis of PKP2, DSP, DSG2, and DSC2 was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the first symptom and at diagnosis was 38.6±14.8 years and 40.5±17.7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probands in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was cardiopulmonary arrest were significantly younger (22.3±15.3 years) than those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (41.1±13.2 years) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (45.7±8.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On genetic screening, 19 mutation carriers were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was no age dependence for each gene mutation carrier, carriers with PKP2 premature stop codon developed the disease at a significantly younger age than other mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The initial clinical manifestations in some young probands were very severe, and PKP2 mutations with a premature stop codon would be associated with disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at a younger age </plain></SENT>
