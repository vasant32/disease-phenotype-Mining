<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the associations between PR interval and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, AF, and mortality in a biracial cohort of older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study is a prospective, biracial cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine PR interval (hazard ratios expressed per SD increase) and 10-year risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, AF, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable models included demographic, anthropometric, and clinical variables in addition to established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined 2722 Health ABC participants (aged 74Â±3 years, 51.9% women, and 41% black) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not identify significant effect modification by race for the outcomes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, every SD increase (29 ms) in PR interval was associated with a 13% greater 10-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.25) and a 13% increased risk of incident AF (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PR interval &gt;200 ms was associated with a 46% increased risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PR interval was not associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified significant relationships of PR interval to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and AF in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings extend prior investigations by examining PR interval and associations with adverse outcomes in a biracial cohort of older men and women </plain></SENT>
