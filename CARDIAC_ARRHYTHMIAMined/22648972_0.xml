<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies attribute these defects in part to alterations in the function of cardiac type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s), the principal Ca(2+)-release channels on the internal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, mechanisms underlying RyR2 dysregulation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remain poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rat model of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, in combination with echocardiography, in vivo and ex vivo hemodynamic studies, confocal microscopy, Western blotting, mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, and [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> binding, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer, and transfection assays, was used to determine whether post-translational modification by reactive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> species (RCS) represented a contributing cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, spontaneous Ca(2+) release in ventricular myocytes increased ~5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evoked Ca(2+) release from the SR was nonuniform (dyssynchronous) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total RyR2 protein levels remained unchanged, but the ability to bind the Ca(2+)-dependent ligand [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and mass spectrometry revealed RCS adducts on select basic residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutation of residues to delineate the physiochemical impact of carbonylation yielded channels with enhanced or reduced cytoplasmic Ca(2+) responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prototype RCS <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">methylglyoxal</z:chebi> increased and then decreased the RyR2 open probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17158">Methylglyoxal</z:chebi> also increased spontaneous Ca(2+) release and induced Ca(2+) waves in healthy myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment of diabetic rats with RCS scavengers normalized spontaneous and evoked Ca(2+) release from the SR, reduced carbonylation of RyR2s, and increased binding of [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> to RyR2s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these data, we conclude that post-translational modification by RCS contributes to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in RyR2 activity that is seen in experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
