<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: we assessed the qualitative rapid troponin I in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> equivalent symptoms after at least 4 hours and then we followed the patients in 72 hours after presentation for adverse events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, CCU admission, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After comparing qualitative troponin I test results and adverse events, we concluded that the troponin I was significantly more positive in patients with adverse events (i.e. CCU admission, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>) (P=0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single measurement of rapid qualitative troponin I test can be used as a prognostic factor in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> equivalent symptoms and also as a device for risk stratification of moderate and high risk patients </plain></SENT>
