<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to assess cost-effectiveness of this nurse-led care programme vs. usual care.METHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken alongside the randomized controlled trial in which 712 patients were included at the Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands, and allocated to nurse-led care or usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nurse-led care implied guideline-adherent management, steered by dedicated software, supervised by cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usual care was regular outpatient care performed by cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cost per life-year and a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis was performed, both from a hospital perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nurse-led care programme was associated with slightly more life-years and QALYs at a lower cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the nurse-led programme contributed to 0.009 QALY gains with a reduced cost of €1109 per patient and a gain of 0.02 life-years with a reduced cost of €735 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the nurse-led programme would be considered dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the possible values of willingness to pay for a QALY the nurse-led programme is considered to be more likely cost-effective than the care as usual.CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analysis in the present study demonstrated that a nurse-led integrated care approach will save costs and improve survival and quality of life, and is therefore a cost-effective management strategy for patients with AF </plain></SENT>
