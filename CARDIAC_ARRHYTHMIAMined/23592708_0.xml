<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While some analyses suggest an association of digoxin with a higher mortality in AF, the intrinsic nature of this association has not been examined in propensity-matched cohorts, which is the objective of the current study.Methods and resultsIn <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM), 4060 patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF were randomized to rate (n = 2027) vs. rhythm (n = 2033) control strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1377 received digoxin as initial therapy and 1329 received no digoxin at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Propensity scores for digoxin use were estimated for each of these 2706 patients and used to assemble a cohort of 878 pairs of patients receiving and not receiving digoxin, who were balanced on 59 baseline characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Matched patients had a mean age of 70 years, 40% were women, and 11% non-white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 3.4 years of the mean follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality occurred in 14 and 13% of matched patients receiving and not receiving digoxin, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) associated with digoxin use: 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-1.37; P = 0.640] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among matched patients, digoxin had no association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.85-1.09; P = 0.510) or incident non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.37-2.23; P = 0.827) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digoxin had no multivariable-adjusted or propensity score-adjusted associations with these outcomes in the pre-match cohort.ConclusionsIn patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, we found no evidence of increased mortality or hospitalization in those taking digoxin as baseline initial therapy </plain></SENT>
