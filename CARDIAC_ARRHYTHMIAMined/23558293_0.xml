<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing number of drugs interfere with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> trafficking of ion channels to and from the plasma membrane, thereby altering the number of channels on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most drugs do this at clinically relevant concentrations, which may lead to potentially life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, major progress has been made in the understanding of the subcellular mechanisms by which drugs affect the trafficking of ion channels, which is of great benefit for the development of ways to counteract these adverse drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological correction seems to be a promising approach to address the trafficking defects induced by several drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, as pharmacological correction is hampered by concomitant direct channel block or unspecific effects, further studies are needed to improve its potential as a clinical therapy </plain></SENT>
