<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Greater scrutiny is being placed on developing a full understanding of potential cardiotoxicity of therapeutic agents, especially on the potential to prolong the QTc interval which can lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This trial was designed to specifically evaluate the effect, if any, of cetuximab on the QTc interval in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cetuximab was administered as an initial dose of 400 mg/m(2) on day 1 (week 1) followed by a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m(2) weekly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG monitoring was performed at screening, baseline (week 1 preceding dosing), and during week 1 to 5 of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab concentration-to-QTc relationship was evaluated based on cetuximab serum samples obtained at the time of each ECG measurement to allow for accurate correlation between any observed QT/QTc changes and cetuximab serum concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the recommended dose (400 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 250 mg/m(2) weekly), cetuximab had no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval, PR or QRS intervals, or heart rate and there was no apparent concentration-dependent effect of cetuximab on any of these electrocardiogram parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety observations in patients treated with cetuximab in this study were consistent with the agent's known safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cetuximab can be safely administered as a single agent without risk of effect on QTc interval </plain></SENT>
