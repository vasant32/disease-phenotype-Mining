<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A considerable number of lead defects occurs during long-term cardioverter defibrillator therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence-based strategies for the handling of chronically implanted, non-functional high-voltage (HV) leads are mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient outcome after abandonment of HV leads was retrospectively compared with patient outcome following other lead revision strategies and following primary implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 903 consecutive patients undergoing 997 implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantations or lead revisions were followed for a mean period of 48.8 Â± 37.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One or more additional HV leads were placed in 60 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional pace/sense lead was implanted in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extraction and replacement of a dysfunctional HV lead was performed in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of complications including artefact sensing, ineffective defibrillation, symptomatic subclavian vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and other lead defects did not differ between patients with and without an additional HV lead (10.0 vs. 8.9%, P = 0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival without lead associated complications did not differ between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results remained unchanged after correction for covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abandoned HV leads did not increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> system-related complications in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, a general lead extraction policy of dysfunctional HV leads cannot be advised in an average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recommendations may not apply for young and physically active patients, in whom HV lead extraction must be considered </plain></SENT>
