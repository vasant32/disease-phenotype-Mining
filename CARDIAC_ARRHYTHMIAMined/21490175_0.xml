<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The authors used cardiorespiratory physiological measures, simulated driving behavior, and self-report to examine how participants with high and low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> symptoms responded to frustration and to determine how frustration affected simulated driving performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Groups did not differ in operational driving skills, but participants with high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> symptoms reported more frustration and exhibited more impairment at the tactical level of driving performance than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant suppression of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> from resting baseline during tasks, but it did not differ between groups during driving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This article proposes that remedial driver training for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> populations should focus more on the control of negative emotions rather than on attention or fundamental driving skills </plain></SENT>
