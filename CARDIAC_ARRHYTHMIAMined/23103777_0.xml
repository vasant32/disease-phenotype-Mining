<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients receiving an infusion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, the relationship between the amplitude of the oximeter plethysmographic waveform and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume may be variable and quality of the waveform might be reduced, compared with patients not receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the reliability of the pleth variability index (PVI), an automatic measurement of the respiratory variation of the plethysmographic waveform, for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the response of cardiac index (transpulmonary thermodilution) to i.v. fluid administration in 42 critically ill patients receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, spontaneous breathing, tidal volume &lt;8 ml kg(-1), and respiratory system compliance &lt;30 ml cm <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15377">H(2)O</z:chebi>(-1) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before fluid administration, we recorded the arterial pulse pressure variation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and pulse contour analysis-derived <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variation (SVV, PiCCO2) and PVI (Masimo Radical-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In seven patients, the plethysmographic signal could not be obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 35 remaining patients [mean SAPS II score=77 (sd=17)], i.v. fluid increased cardiac index ≥15% in 15 'responders' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A baseline PVI ≥16% predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 47 (inter-quartile range=21-73)% and a specificity of 90 (68-99)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly lower for PVI [0.68 (0.09)] than for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and SVV [0.93 (0.06) and 0.89 (0.07), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pairs of measurements, PVI was correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> (r(2)=0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The fluid-induced changes in PVI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> were not significantly correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVI was less reliable than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and SVV for predicting fluid responsiveness in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, PVI could not be measured in a significant proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This suggests that PVI is not useful in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
