<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An estimated 10% to 15% of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>) cases may stem from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathy</z:e>-mediated lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of the GJA1-encoded gap junction channel protein connexin43 is known to underlie formation of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GJA1 mutations have been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, GJA1 is a plausible candidate gene for premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: GJA1 open reading frame mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct DNA sequencing on DNA from 292 SIDS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence and dual whole-cell patch-clamp studies were performed to determine the functionality of mutant gap junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for gap junction proteins was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>-associated paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two rare, novel missense mutations, E42K and S272P, were detected in 2 of 292 SIDS cases, a 2-month-old white boy and a 3-month-old white girl, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the E42K victim's parental DNA demonstrated a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both mutations involved highly conserved residues and were absent in &gt;1000 ethnically matched reference alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence demonstrated no trafficking abnormalities for either mutation, and S272P demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> junctional conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, junctional conductance measurements for the E42K mutation demonstrated a loss of function not rescued by <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the E42K victim's cardiac tissue demonstrated a mosaic immunostaining pattern for connexin43 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first molecular and functional evidence implicating a GJA1 mutation as a novel pathogenic substrate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>E42K-connexin43 demonstrated a trafficking-independent reduction in junctional coupling in vitro and a mosaic pattern of mutational DNA distribution in deceased cardiac tissue, suggesting a novel mechanism of connexin43-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
