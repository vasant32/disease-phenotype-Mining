<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of nerve sprouting induced by MI are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway involved in cardiac sympathetic hyperinnervation after MI in rabbit hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An MI model was induced by ligation of the coronary artery in rabbits, which were then euthanized after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbits with MI showed sympathetic hyperinnervation, as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis of the density of nerve fibers positive for growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using western blot and real-time RT-PCR techniques, we found that MI was associated with activation of NF-κB signaling and consequent upregulation of nerve growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration with the NF-κB inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> dithiocarbamate (100mg/kg/day) inhibited NF-κB activation and ameliorated sympathetic hyperinnervation after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cardiac nerve sprouting after MI is associated in part with NF-κB activation and may be one of the mechanisms responsible for sympathetic hyperinnervation induced by MI </plain></SENT>
