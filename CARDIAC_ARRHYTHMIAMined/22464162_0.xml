<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The passive leg raising maneuver (PLR) for fluid responsiveness testing relies on cardiac output (CO) measurements or invasive measurements of arterial pressure (AP) whereas the initial hemodynamic management during shock is often based solely on brachial cuff measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed PLR-induced changes in noninvasive oscillometric readings to predict fluid responsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Multicentre interventional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ICU sedated patients with circulatory failure, AP (invasive and noninvasive readings) and CO measurements were performed before, during PLR (trunk supine, not modified) and after 500-mL volume expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were determined for fluid responsiveness (&gt;10% volume expansion-induced increase in CO) prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 112 patients (19% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), changes in noninvasive systolic AP during PLR (noninvasiveΔ(PLR)SAP) only predicted fluid responsiveness (cutoff 17%, n=21, positive likelihood ratio [LR] of 26 [18-38]), not unresponsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If PLR-induced change in central venous pressure (CVP) was at least of 2 mm Hg (n=60), suggesting that PLR succeeded in altering cardiac preload, noninvasiveΔ(PLR)SAP performance was good: AUC of 0.94 [0.85-0.98], positive and negative LRs of 5.7 [4.6-6.8] and 0.07 [0.009-0.5], respectively, for a cutoff of 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of note, invasive AP-derived indices did not outperform noninvasiveΔ(PLR)SAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regardless of CVP (i.e., during "blind PLR"), noninvasiveΔ(PLR)SAP more than 17% reliably identified fluid responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During "CVP-guided PLR", in case of sufficient change in CVP, noninvasiveΔ(PLR)SAP performed better (cutoff of 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings, in sedated patients who had already undergone volume expansion and/or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, have to be verified during the early phase of circulatory failure (before an arterial line and/or a CO measuring device is placed) </plain></SENT>
