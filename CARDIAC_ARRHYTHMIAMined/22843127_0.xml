<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Targeting the proper left ventricular lead site is important in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedures, as suboptimal lead locations may result in a lack of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead locations are typically confirmed using fluoroscopy (fluoro) with AP, RAO, and LAO orientations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, standard fluoro may inadequately delineate true left ventricular lead locations, due to insufficient angulation or extreme cardiac rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiograph (CXRPAL), performed routinely to verify lead stability and freedom from complication, may better confirm left ventricular lead location due to utilization of a straight lateral view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: Compared to fluoro, lead localization using CXRPAL will be more predictive of true left ventricular lead location in CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 252 medically optimized <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients who underwent CRT implantation by multiple operators from October 2001 to August 2011, 46 (mean age, 58.9 ± 13.2 years; 10 female; 19 ICM; 19 LBBB; mean ejection fraction, 26.6 ± 8.9 %; mean QRS width, 144.4 ms) had CT scanning performed as part of routine medical care and comprise this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative reports of left ventricular lead location by fluoro were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead location was identified on CXRPAL by three independent observers blinded to operative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular lead locations according to fluoro and CXRPAL were correlated with CT scan at a mean follow-up of 57.6 ± 28.8 months (Tables 1 and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to standard fluoro, CXRPAL agreed better with CT scan (κ = 0.413 fluoro vs. κ = 0.864 CXRPAL on the vertical axis, and κ = 0.086 fluoro vs. κ = 0.864 CXRPAL on the horizontal axis) for identification of left ventricular lead location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small study of 46 CRT patients, interpretation of left ventricular lead location using CXRPAL correlated better with true lead location identified on CT scan, compared to standard fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of a steep lateral view during CRT implantation may be necessary to accurately identify left ventricular lead locations </plain></SENT>
