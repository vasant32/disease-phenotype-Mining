<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that atrial regions contribute differently to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein and the surrounding left atrial junction (LA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> junction) are crucial areas in AF substrates and important ablation targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify regional differences in the left atria of patients with AF by using a genome-wide approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Paired LA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> junction and left atrial appendage (LAA) specimens were obtained from 16 patients with persistent AF and 3 with sinus rhythm who underwent valvular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The paired specimens were sent for microarray comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 54,675 expressed sequence tags, microarray analysis in patients with AF revealed that 391 genes were differentially expressed between the LA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> junction and the LAA, including genes related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microarray and real time-polymerase chain reaction produced parallel results in analyzing the expression of particular genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients with AF and sinus rhythm, the LA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> junction exhibited greater paired-like homeodomain-2 and its target protein (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> homeobox-2) expression than the LAA, which might contribute to arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five genes related to thrombogenesis were upregulated in the LAA of patients with AF, which might implicate for the preferential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genes related to <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were highly expressed in the LAA of patients with AF, which was reflected by intense ultrastructural changes in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We used a genome-wide approach to investigate region-specific gene expression in the left atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide important information relevant to region-specific arrhythmogenesis and thrombogenesis in AF pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
