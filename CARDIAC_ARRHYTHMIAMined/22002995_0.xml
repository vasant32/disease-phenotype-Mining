<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The properties of the atrioventricular (AV) node in the neonate heart and its role in unique pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo> (JET) are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due in large part to the dearth of information on the structure and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the AV node in the immature myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sinoatrial nodal cells (SANCs), AV nodal tissues, and myocytes (AVNCs) were obtained from neonatal (10-day-old) rabbits, and the histological, immunohistological, and electrophysiological properties were characterized in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Masson's trichrome histological staining clearly delineated AV nodal structures including the inferior nodal extension, compact node, and the bundle of His region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AV tissue sections and AVNCs were immunolabeled against neurofilament 160 (NF160), connexin 43 (Cx43), hyperpolarization-activated, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotide</z:chebi> modulated channel (HCN4), <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>/calcium exchanger, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump (SERCA), and phospholamban (PLB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AVNCs with triple-positive NF160, SERCA, and PLB labeling, SERCA and PLB were found with high degrees of colocalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority (59%) of NF160-positive AVNCs were found to coexpress HCN4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NF160 and HCN4 expression was found to be even higher in SANCs, where 88% of SANCs exhibited coexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous action potentials recorded from isolated neonatal AVNCs were uniformly of the atrionodal type, showing none of the action potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> found in the mature heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Current recordings found the hyperpolarization-activated funny current (I(f)) in 55% (11 of 21 cells) of AVNCs, consistent with the immunocytochemistry results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first detailed electrophysiological and immunohistological report of the neonatal AV node and lays the groundwork for a better understanding of heart rate regulation and unique <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the neonate heart </plain></SENT>
