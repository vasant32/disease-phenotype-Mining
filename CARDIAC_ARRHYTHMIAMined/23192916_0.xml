<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mycelia of cultured Cordyceps sinensis (CS) is one of the most common substitutes for natural CS and was approved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the role of CS in ameliorating injury during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I/R) is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined effects of extracts from CS on I/R and investigated the possible mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic coronary perfusion pressure, ventricular function, and coronary flow were measured using the Langendorff mouse heart model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> of cardiac homogenates was performed using an ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that CS affords cardioprotection possibly through enhanced <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardioprotection was demonstrated by reduced post-ischemic diastolic dysfunction and improved recovery of pressure development and coronary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CS largely abrogates <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and damage in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>- or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>-perfused hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, observed reductions in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17858">glutathione disulfide</z:chebi> (GSSG)]/[GSSG + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>] and [malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>)]/[<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase + <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>] ratios as well as the resultant damage upon CS treatment correlate with functional markers of post-ischemic myocardial outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These effects of CS were partially blocked by 8-ρ-sulfophenyltheophylline, an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate a suppressive role of CS in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the results also suggest pre-ischemic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor activation may be involved in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> in hearts pretreated with CS </plain></SENT>
