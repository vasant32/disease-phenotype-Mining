<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of sympathovagal balance on the respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) amplitude and respiratory SBF oscillations has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects with predominant parasympathetic tonus had statistically significant higher RSA amplitudes in the breathing rate region of 0.03-0.07 Hz than the subjects with predominant sympathetic tonus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the finger-cushion zone, having a well-developed sympathetic vascular innervations, the amplitudes of respiratory SBF oscillations at breathing rates 0.05 and 0.07 Hz were higher in the group of subjects with predominant parasympathetic tonus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the forearm skin, where the density of sympathetic innervations is low comparatively to that in the finger skin, no statistically significant differences in the amplitude of respiratory SBF oscillations were found concerning the two groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
