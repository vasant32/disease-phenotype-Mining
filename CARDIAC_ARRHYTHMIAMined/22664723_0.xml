<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Coronary artery spasm</z:e> (CS) also occurs during sleep and is rarely associated with SCA, but the role of SDB in the risk of SCA is unknown in CS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the breathing patterns during sleep in CS patients with a prior history of aborted SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study enrolled 24 patients (age 61.6 ± 11.0 years, male/female 19/5) with CS proven by an <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> provocation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups: prior history of aborted SCA due to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (SCA group; n=9) and no such history (no-SCA group; n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent overnight polysomnography with ambulatory electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of SDB (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index ≥15) was 45.8% in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SDB was more frequent in the SCA group than in the no-SCA group (88.9% vs. 20.0% P=0.001) and identified as a pivotal risk factor of aborted SCA (odds ratio: 38.9, 95% CI: 2.80-1,498.2, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Very-low-frequency was significantly correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index in patients with SCA (P=0.01, r=0.78) during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SDB is a significant risk factor for SCA in CS patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic instability</z:e> during sleep might be involved in this association </plain></SENT>
