<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiological data were collected from 98 college students during baseline and fear film-viewing and recovery periods in the lab, and their affectivity data were collected three times (immediately before, 4 months after and 12 months after the physiological data collection) using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Emotional Expressivity Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that trait positive affect was stably associated with baseline RSA independently of trait negative affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Positive emotional expressivity was also stably associated with baseline RSA independently of negative emotional expressivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither trait affect nor emotional expressivity was associated with RSA reactivity or RSA rebound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that baseline vagal tone might be the parasympathetic correlate of individuals with a positive emotional style </plain></SENT>
