<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to compare the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of 89 ion channel subunits, calcium handling proteins, and transcription factors important in cardiac conduction and arrhythmogenesis in the left atria (LA) and ventricles (LV) of failing and nonfailing human hearts of both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> samples, prepared from failing male (n = 9) and female (n =���7), and from nonfailing male (n = 9) and female (n = 9) hearts, were probed using custom-designed Taqman gene arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed to explore the relationships between gender, failure state, and chamber expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed chamber specific expression patterns, but failed to identify disease- or gender-dependent clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gender-specific analysis showed lower expression levels in transcripts encoding for K(v)4.3, KChIP2, K(v)1.5, and K(ir)3.1 in the failing female as compared with the male LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of LV transcripts, however, did not reveal significant differences based on gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, our data highlight the differential expression and transcriptional remodeling of ion channel subunits in the human heart as a function of gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the availability of such data sets will allow for the development of disease-, gender-, and, most importantly, patient-specific cardiac models, with the ability to utilize such information as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression to predict cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
