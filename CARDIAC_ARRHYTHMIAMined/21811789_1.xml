<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain if downregulation of β-adrenoceptor signaling pathway is promoted by an enhanced adrenergic tone at an early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, or it develops secondary to detrimental local myocardial changes in advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the integrity of β-adrenoceptor signaling pathway upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>, a β-adrenoceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, at a dose producing no structural left ventricular (LV) remodeling and systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion (400 μg kg(-1) h(-1) over 16 days) to guinea pigs using osmotic minipumps produced no change in cardiac weights, LV internal dimensions, myocyte cross-sectional area, extent of interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and basal contractile function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated, perfused heart preparations from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-treated guinea pigs exhibited attenuated responsiveness to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> β-adrenoceptor stimulation, as evidenced by reduced LV developed pressure increase, less shortening of LV epicardial monophasic action potential and effective refractory period, and less myocardial cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate elevation, in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> exposure, when compared to saline-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi>, an activator of the adenylate cyclase catalytic subunit, were well preserved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-treated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of β-adrenoceptor-mediated effects upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion was associated with markedly reduced stimulatory G-protein α-subunit (G(sα)) myocardial expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No change in expression levels of β-adrenoceptors, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, inhibitory G-protein α-subunit (G(iα2)), and Ca(v)1.2 and K(v)7.1 ion channels was determined in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>-treated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that sustained adrenergic overstimulation may promote downregulation of myocardial β-adrenoceptor-mediated effects independently of structural LV remodeling and systolic failure, an effect attributed to β-adrenoceptor uncoupling from adenylate cyclase due to reduced G(sα)-protein expression </plain></SENT>
