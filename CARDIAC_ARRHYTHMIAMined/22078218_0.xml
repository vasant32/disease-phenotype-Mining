<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> are related to <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary venous obstruction</z:mp> and pressure loading of the right side of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe our institutional experience with repair of <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From June 1963 to June 2010, 65 patients underwent repair at a median age of 7.2 months (range 2 days to 47.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 49 (75%) had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>Atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (n = 29), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> (n = 15), partially or totally <z:hpo ids='HP_0010772'>anomalous pulmonary venous return</z:hpo> (n = 14), mitral valve abnormalities (n = 11), and supravalvar mitral ring (n = 5) were the most common associated defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment consisted of excision of the membrane, along with additional procedures in 47 patients (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had new postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up period of 5.4 years, no patients underwent reintervention for recurrent left atrial obstruction, 7 patients were noted to have minor residual <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> without obstruction, and 8 patients (including 4 diagnosed before <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> repair) had <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary vein stenosis</z:mp>, 6 of whom underwent intervention for that reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this large surgical series of patients who underwent repair of <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp>, there were no cases of significant residual or recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the association between <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010438'>pulmonary vein stenosis</z:mp> has been described previously, the relative frequency of this condition in our cohort (&gt;10%, including patients diagnosed before and after <z:mp ids='MP_0010409'>cor triatriatum</z:mp> repair) is noteworthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001633'>Abnormalities of the mitral valve</z:hpo> and a supravalvar mitral ring were also seen more often than the existing research would suggest, which may be another important consideration in evaluating and following these patients </plain></SENT>
