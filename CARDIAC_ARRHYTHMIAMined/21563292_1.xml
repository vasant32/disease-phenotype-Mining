<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare pre- and post-procedure electrocardiograms (ECGs) in a large cohort of patients after percutaneous closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous device closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> is commonplace </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conduction and rhythm anomalies associated with percutaneous device placement have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed records for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent percutaneous device closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> at our institution from 1999 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-procedure ECG and Holter studies were compared to available short term (&lt;2 months after placement) and intermediate follow-up (&gt;2 months) ECG or Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre- and post-procedural ECGs were available in 610 patients (305 females, average age 50 Â± 18.1 years, range 1-91 years, 384 <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, 184 ASD, 42 with multiple defects, mean device size 16 mm, range 5-38 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report an incidence of 5.2% (32/610) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the 4 months following device placement, including 29 patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs, 22 <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, 7 flutter), 1 with junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among other findings, the average P-wave duration was increased on intermediate follow-up as compared to early follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Development of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 1st degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV Block</z:mp> after the procedure was associated with an increased risk of ATs post-procedure (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report a low risk of clinically significant post-procedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after device placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> occurred in only two patients (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in several markers of atrial conduction were found, suggesting an effect of device closure on intra-atrial conduction </plain></SENT>
