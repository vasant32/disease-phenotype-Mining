<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one centres, members of the EHRA-EP Research Network, responded to this survey and completed the questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two per cent of the responding centres always use CRT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) patients with New York Heart Association functional class II and QRS width &gt;120 ms, and 55% of the responding centres demand additional criteria when indicating CRT, most often QRS width &gt;150 ms (49%) and echocardiographic criteria of asynchrony (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 10% of centres indicate CRT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HF patients with QRS &gt;120 ms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo>, and 51% demand additional criteria, most frequently echocardiographic asynchrony parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of centres also indicate CRT in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and standard criteria for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 24% of the centres, biventricular pacemaker (CRT-P) is implanted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> situations, unless there is an indication for secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, while 10% always choose to implant a biventricular defibrillator (CRT-D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are no clear evidence-based recommendations concerning the implant procedure and follow-up in patients treated with CRT; therefore, the chosen strategies vary widely from one centre to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This EP Wire survey shows a wide variation not only as far as CRT indications are concerned, but especially in techniques, implant strategy, and follow-up across the European countries </plain></SENT>
