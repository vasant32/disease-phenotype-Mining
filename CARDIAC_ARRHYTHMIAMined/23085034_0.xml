<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoprenaline</z:chebi> (ISO) acts through Î²-adrenergic receptors to increase the intracellular Ca(2+), which has effects on action potential duration (APD) restitution and arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we investigated the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> on APD restitution and ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VA) in the rabbit heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rabbits were randomly selected to receive an injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (ISO group) or an equal volume of 0.9% saline (CTL group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The S(1)-S(2) protocol (n=15) and S(1) dynamic pacing (n=15) were performed to construct APD restitution and to induce APD alternans or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 10 sites of Langendorff-perfused hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the same sites in the control group, long-term ISO administration (7 days) shortened the APD(90) and the effective refractory period (ERP), and greatly increased the spatial dispersion of APD and ERP (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to CTL group, the APD restitution curves were significantly changed (p&lt;0.01) and showed increased spacial dispersion of maximal slope (S(max)) among each site in the ISO group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In induction of VA and APD alternans, the threshold of VA and alternans was both decreased in each site of the ISO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> stimulation with ISO facilitated VA, possibly through the increased spatial dispersion of APD restitution </plain></SENT>
