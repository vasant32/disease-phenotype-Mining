<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>239 international athletes were involved in this cross sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body-fat percentage and resting 12-lead ECGs were recorded from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 239 participant athletes, 212 were male and 27 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>60% of participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 84% of the athletes demonstrated at least 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average values for the PR, QRS and QT intervals, P-wave duration and QRS axis were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of various ECG abnormal findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> athletes were as follows: right axis deviation 4.2%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> 6.2%, sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> 5.8%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e>) 24.2% (incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> 16.8%, complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> 7.4%), ST elevation 72.5%, <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> 1.7%, T inversion 3.1% and Mobitz type I 1.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The athletes' ECG response to treadmill stress test was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The means of BMI and body-fat percentage were 24.04 ± 3.5 kg/m² and 9.15 ± 2.12%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation coefficient between body-fat percentage and ST changes was 0.65 (P=0.008) in anterior leads and 0.198 (P=0.017) in lateral leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, the correlation coefficient between the body fat percentage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011712'>right bundle branch block</z:hpo> was 0.36 (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of current study support the inclusion of ECG in athletes' cardiac screening before they engage in vigorous exercises in order to detect the potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
