<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study examined the impact of different ablation strategies on AF recurrence and quality of life (QoL) in coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and flutter (AFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-hundred sixty enrolled patients with documented AF and AFL were blinded and randomized to group 1: AF±AFL ablation (n=182) or Group 2: AFL ablation only (n=178) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF-recurrence was evaluated with event-recording and 7-day Holter at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QoL was assessed at baseline and 12-month follow-up using 4 questionnaires; Medical Outcome Study Short Form, Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Score, Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory and State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 182 patients in group 1, 58 (63±8 years, 78% male, 59±8% LVEF) had AF+AFL ablation and 124 (61±11 years, 72% male, 59±7% LVEF) had AF ablation only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 2 (62±9 years, 76% male, 58±10% LVEF) only flutter was ablated by achieving bidirectional isthmus conduction block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline characteristics were not different across groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 21±9 months follow-up, 125 (69%) in group 1 and 34 (19%) in group 2 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In group 1, scores on most QoL subscales showed significant improvement at follow-up, whereas group 2 patients derived relatively minor benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In coexistent AF and AFL, lower recurrence rate and better QoL is associated with AF ablation only or AF +AFL ablation, than with lone AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, QoL directly correlates with freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as shown in this study for the first time, in patients blinded to the procedure </plain></SENT>
