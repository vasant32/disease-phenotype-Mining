<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) often coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some patients, AF remission is seen after successful percutaneous radiofrequency current ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate factors affecting AF remission in patients with typical AFL and concomitant AF who underwent CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included consecutive 69 patients with typical AFL and concomitant clinically documented AF who underwent successful CTI ablation in 2003-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the follow-up data from medical records and telephone interviews, the patients were divided into two groups: with persistent AF (group A) and with remission of AF (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This distinction was based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> symptoms reported by the patient, such as palpitation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>irregular heartbeat</z:hpo>, and confirmed electrocardiographically (12-lead ECG or Holter monitoring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group A included 47 patients, and group B included 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two groups did not differ significantly in regard to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and concomitant diseases including <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two groups also did not differ by echocardiographically determined mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left atrial dimension (43.5 ± 9.27 vs. 39.27 ± 5.76, p = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression did not identify any independent risk factors of AF persistence after CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariate logistic regression also did not show arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, LVEF, left ventricular dimension or age to affect AF persistence after successful ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, we were unable to identify factors determining remission of AF coexisting with AFL in patients after percutaneous CTI ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may indicate the need for complex ablation procedure (involving both CTI and pulmonary venous ostia ablation) in patients in whom these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> coexist </plain></SENT>
