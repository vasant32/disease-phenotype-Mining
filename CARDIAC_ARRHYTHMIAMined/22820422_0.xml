<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present an animal study to investigate both pharmacokinetic and clinical effects of an anticalin specific for the digitalis compound digoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous digoxin (2.5-50 μg/kg/min) was administered to rats until first changes in the ECG occurred (dose finding study) or a priori for 30 min (kinetic study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anticalin DigA16(H86N), dubbed DigiCal, was administered intravenously at absolute doses of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg, while the control group received isotonic saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic changes, several ECG parameters and digoxin concentration in plasma were monitored at given time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After DigiCal administration free digoxin concentration in plasma ultrafiltrate declined dramatically within 1 min to the presumably non-toxic range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant and DigiCal dose-dependent effect on longer survival, less ECG alterations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and improved hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infusion of a lower digoxin dose (2.5 μg/kg/min) resulted in a more sustained reduction of free digoxin in plasma after DigiCal administration compared to a higher digoxin dose (25 μg/kg/min), whereas ECG and hemodynamic parameters did not markedly differ, reflecting the known relative insensitivity of rats towards digoxin toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notably, we observed a re-increase of free digoxin in plasma some time after bolus administration of DigiCal, which was presumably due to toxin redistribution from tissue in combination with the relatively fast renal clearance of the rather small protein <z:chebi fb="183" ids="50247">antidote</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that anticalins with appropriately engineered drug-binding activities and, possibly, prolonged plasma half-life offer prospects for next-generation antidotal therapy </plain></SENT>
