<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Electrophysiologic characteristics, mapping strategies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rates of radiofrequency catheter ablation of atriofascicular accessory pathways are well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on long-term prognosis and predictors for freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our 20-year single-center experience on ablation of atriofascicular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between 1992 and 2010, 34 patients with atriofascicular accessory pathways underwent catheter ablation at our institution because of symptomatic antidromic atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency procedures were retrospectively analyzed, and patients were followed for recurrences of tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms (before and after ablation and at follow-up) were analyzed for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful catheter ablation of the atriofascicular fiber was achieved in 23 (68%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanical block during mapping occurred in 3 (9%) patients, and in 2 of them ablation was performed at the site of mechanical block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mere modification of conduction properties of the pathway without complete block was achieved in 5 patients (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fast pathway ablation was performed in 2 (6%) of the patients ablated in the early 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 9.3 ± 5.5 years, 24 patients (71%) remained free of tachyarrhythmias, 7 reported significant improvement, and 3 (9%) had no change in symptoms after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term success was identical between patients from the first (1992-1999) and second (2000-2010) decade (12 of 17 [71%] vs 12 of 17 [71%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was 87% in those with complete block of the atriofascicular fiber while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with mechanical block during mapping reported recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fast pathway ablation was complicated by complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> in 1 patient, who required pacemaker implantation 18 years after ablation owing to loss of conduction properties of the atriofascicular fiber over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On analyzing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> before ablation (n = 16; 47%), we found that the PR interval after ablation was significantly longer only in those without recurrence (162 ± 21 ms vs 134 ± 21 ms; P = .042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of the other analyzed electrocardiographic parameters, including PR, QRS duration, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo>, had prognostic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success of complete ablation of atriofascicular pathways is associated with excellent long-term success (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mere modification of conduction properties of atriofascicular fibers or ablation at the sites of mechanical block are less promising end points of ablation with high recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Technical innovations during decades may not further improve long-term outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
