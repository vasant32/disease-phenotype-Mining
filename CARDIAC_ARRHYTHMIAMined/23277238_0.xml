<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare the incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiac events as well as mortality in elderly persons treated with second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> (SGAs) with that of elderly persons treated with conventional first-generation agents (FGAs) in the province of Manitoba </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents of Manitoba aged 65 and older, who were dispensed antipsychotic medications for the first time during the period from April 1, 2000, to March 31, 2007, was conducted using Manitoba Health administrative databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare risks of adverse events in FGA and SGA users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounders (demographics, comorbidity, and medication use), SGA use was not associated with a significantly greater risk of cerebrovascular events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> compared to FGA use (adjusted hazard ratios [HR], respectively: 1.136; 95% CI, 0.961-1.344; 0.865; 95% CI, 0.336-2.232; 1.127, 95% CI, 0.902-1.409) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> users were found to be at a lower risk of mortality (adjusted HR, 0.683; 95% CI, 0.577-0.809), but at a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (adjusted HR, 1.614; 95% CI, 1.024-2.543) compared to FGA users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly users of antipsychotic medications, the risk of cerebrovascular events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> was similar in FGA and SGA users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas SGA users were at a higher risk of nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, the use of FGAs was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Antipsychotic pharmacotherapy in older persons needs to be chosen with careful consideration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risks and benefits </plain></SENT>
