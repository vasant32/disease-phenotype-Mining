<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Better <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> risk markers are needed in ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ICM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of electrical restitution is an important mechanism underlying the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to develop and test a novel quantitative surface electrocardiogram-based measure of VA risk in patients with ICM: the Regional Restitution Instability Index (R2I2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: R2I2, the mean of the standard deviation of residuals from the mean gradient for each ECG lead at a range of diastolic intervals, was measured retrospectively from high-resolution 12-lead ECGs recorded during an electrophysiology study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient groups were as follows: Study group, 26 patients with ICM being assessed for implantable defibrillator; Control group, 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> undergoing electrophysiology study; and Replication group, 40 further patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>R2I2 was significantly higher in the Study patients than in Controls (mean ± standard error of the mean: 1.09±0.06 versus 0.63±0.04, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a median follow-up period of 23 months, 6 of 26 Study group patients had VA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R2I2 predicted VA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> independently of demographic factors, electrophysiology study result, left ventricular ejection fraction, or QRS duration (Cox model, P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>R2I2 correlated with peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (r=0.51, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings were replicated in the Replication group: R2I2 was significantly higher in 11 of 40 Replication patients experiencing VA (1.18±0.10 versus 0.92±0.05, P=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In combined analysis of ICM cohorts, R2I2 ≥1.03 identified subjects with significantly higher risk of VA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (43%) compared with R2I2 &lt;1.03 (11%) (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we have developed a novel VA risk marker, R2I2, and have shown that it correlated with a structural measure of arrhythmic risk and predicted risk of VA or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>R2I2 may improve risk stratification and merits further evaluation </plain></SENT>
