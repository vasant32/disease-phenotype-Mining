<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies report an association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> with medication through prolongation of the cardiac QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has implications in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, as commonly prescribed drugs for non-motor symptoms and comorbidities have QT prolonging potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review prescribed medication in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> patients, in particular the use of drugs that may prolong the cardiac QT interval, in relation to other risk factors for QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medication prescription and doses, presence of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, patient age, and sex were recorded in a cross-sectional sample of 360 current <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> patients attending two district and one regional specialist hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We sampled 360 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, median age 66.5 years (interquartile range 58.5-74.8) and median disease duration 4.2 years (interquartile range 1.2-8.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>125 (34.7%) were taking one or more drugs with definite potential to prolong QT, including domperidone in 91 (25.2%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> in 47 (13.1%), and concurrent antibiotics in 5 (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cofactors increasing the risk for QT interval prolongation were: age over 60 years 71.7%, female sex 46.9%, and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> 19.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with combined risk factors, the rate of prescription of at least one definite QT prolonging drug was between 34.5 and 42.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy and comorbidity relevant to cardiac QT prolongation are common in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Strategies to reduce the proportion of patients at risk from iatrogenic adverse cardiac events are warranted </plain></SENT>
