<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe patient characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities, symptoms, management strategy, and control of different types of AF in real-life practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-life global survey evaluating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (RealiseAF) was a contemporary, large-scale, cross-sectional international survey of patients with AF who had ≥1 episode in the past 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigators were randomly selected to avoid bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 9816 eligible patients from 831 sites in 26 countries, 2606 (26.5%) had paroxysmal, 2341 (23.8%) had persistent, and 4869 (49.6%) had permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent and permanent forms, the prevalence of comorbidities, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (32.9%, 44.3%, and 55.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (30.0%, 32.9%, and 34.3%), cerebrovascular disease (11.7%, 10.8%, and 17.6%), and valvular disease (16.7%, 21.2%, and 35.8%), increased, and the prevalence of lone AF decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was an increase in mean CHADS(2) [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (doubled)] score (1.7, 1.8, and 2.2), and more than half of patients (51.0%, 56.7%, and 67.3%) qualified for oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost 90% of patients received ≥1 antiarrhythmic drug, but &gt;60% had European Heart Rhythm Association symptom scores from II to IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 40.7% of persistent and 49.8% of permanent AF patients were still in AF with a heart rate &gt;80 beats per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This survey disclosed high cardiovascular risks and an unmet need in daily practice for patients with any type of AF, especially those with the permanent form </plain></SENT>
