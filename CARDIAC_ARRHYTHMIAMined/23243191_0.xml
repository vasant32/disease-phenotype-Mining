<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One operative approach to the mitral valve, the superior transseptal incision, is proarrhythmic because of extensive atriotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to describe complex atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> (ATs) that occur after this approach and propose methods to verify lines of block as an end point for catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the 69 patients who had electrophysiological studies for AT after mitral valve surgery, 20 patients had prior superior transseptal incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 had complex ATs involving the lateral right atrium (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 9 dual-loop, 4 single-loop, and 1 focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateral wall ablation was performed either by creating a linear lesion from the lateral atriotomy to the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, or tricuspid annulus or by ablating focally in the lateral RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a single ablation procedure, conduction block in the lateral wall was verified in 10 of 14 patients using 1 of 2 distinct patterns of block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One pattern consisted of late activation in an anterolateral corridor of the RA, and a second pattern consisted of wide-spaced double potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent conduction through the lateral wall lesions was associated with intraprocedural and late recurrences of ATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The optimal end point for ablating ATs after mitral valve surgery with the superior transseptal approach is to establish lines of block that can be recognized by characteristic patterns of activation in the lateral RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A novel criterion for lateral conduction block after catheter ablation is identification of a late-activated corridor in the anterolateral RA </plain></SENT>
