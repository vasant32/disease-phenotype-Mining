<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has been linked with an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To complete a meta-analysis of studies examining the association between AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases and hand search of article references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Prospective and nonprospective studies reporting adjusted risk estimates for the association between AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Two abstracters independently extracted data on study characteristics, risk estimates, methods of AF and outcome ascertainment, and methodological quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly associated with a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with first-ever or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (relative risk [RR], 2.70 [95% CI, 1.82 to 4.00]) and in a broader population including patients with or without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (RR, 1.40 [CI, 1.19 to 1.64]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association in the latter group remained significant independent proof of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history (RR, 1.34 [CI, 1.13 to 1.58]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among studies of the broader population (I2 = 69.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limiting the analysis to prospective studies yielded similar results (RR, 1.36 [CI, 1.12 to 1.65]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Restricting the analysis to studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> eliminated the significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (P = 0.137) but did not alter the pooled estimate substantially (RR, 1.38 [CI, 1.22 to 1.56]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: There is an inherent bias because of confounding variables in observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, with or without a history of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to elucidate the association between AF and subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as well as the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
