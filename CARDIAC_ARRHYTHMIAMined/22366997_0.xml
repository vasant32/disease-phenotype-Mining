<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation were monitored for level of consciousness using bispectral EEG levels (BIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion was performed after the ablation during anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BIS levels prior to, during, and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion were recorded and correlated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, BIS levels significantly increased during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion (median BIS prior to infusion, 46; during infusion, 64 (p &lt; 0.02)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a subsequent increase in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> medication, BIS levels could again be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> infusion alters consciousness level during total intravenous anesthesia for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BIS monitoring is a novel way to modulate anesthesia during ablation to potentially optimize patient comfort and ablation success </plain></SENT>
