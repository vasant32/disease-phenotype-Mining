<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rationale: The Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilaments is increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other heart diseases</z:e> and may contribute to a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ca(2+) sensitization increases susceptibility to reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in animal models, but the underlying mechanism is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: To investigate how myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization creates reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Using HCM mouse models (troponinT (TNT)-I79N) and a Ca(2+) sensitizing drug (EMD57033), here we identify focal energy deprivation as a direct consequence of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To detect ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and thus energy deprivation we measured accumulation of dephosphorylated Connexin 43 (Cx43) isoform P0 as well as <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> kinase activation by Western blotting and immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were detected between groups at baseline, but regional accumulation of Cx43-P0 occurred within minutes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Ca(2+) sensitized hearts, in vivo after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> challenge and in isolated hearts after rapid pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52104">Lucifer yellow dye</z:chebi> spread demonstrated reduced gap junctional coupling in areas with Cx43-P0 accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping revealed that selectively the transverse conduction velocity (CVT) was slowed and anisotropy increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myofilament Ca(2+) de-sensitization with blebbistatin prevented focal energy deprivation, CVT slowing and the reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Myofilament Ca(2+) sensitization rapidly leads to focal energy deprivation and reduced intercellular coupling during conditions that raise <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is a novel pro-arrhythmic mechanism that can increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> susceptibility in structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts within minutes and may therefore contribute to SCD in diseases with increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity </plain></SENT>
