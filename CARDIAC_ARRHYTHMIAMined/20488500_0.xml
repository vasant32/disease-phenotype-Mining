<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) was administered orally to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs and those with experimentally-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, and its plasma concentrations were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations increased dose-dependently after the administration of nicorandil, and were not different between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to the effective plasma values obtained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> in humans, the findings of this pharmacokinetic study may indicate that a dose of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg has the same effectiveness in dogs with cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
