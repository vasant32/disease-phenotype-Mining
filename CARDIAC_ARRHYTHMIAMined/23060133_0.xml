<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of β-Adrenoceptor stimulation on repolarizing currents and action potential (AP) characteristics in human atrial myocytes from left (LAA) and right atrial appendages (RAA) obtained from sinus rhythm (SR) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (CAF) patients have not been compared yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Currents and APs were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp in RAA and LAA myocytes from SR and CAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> concentration-dependently decreased the Ca(2+)-independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi>-sensitive component of the transient outward current (I(to1)) and the inward rectifying current (I(K1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAF significantly enhanced this inhibition, this effect being more marked in the left than in the right atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAF dramatically enhanced β-Adrenoceptor-mediated increase in the slow component of the delayed rectifier current (I(Ks)), whose density was already markedly increased by CAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the ultrarapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(Kur)) of both SR and CAF myocytes was insensitive to low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, stimulation of β1-Adrenoceptors in SR myocytes lengthened, whereas in CAF myocytes shortened, the AP duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative PCR revealed that CAF up-regulated β1-Adrenoceptor expression, preferentially in the left atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate that CAF increases the effects of β1-Adrenoceptor stimulation on repolarizing currents by means of a chamber-specific up-regulation of the receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This, together with the ion channel derangements produced by CAF, could contribute to the long-term stabilization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> by shortening the AP duration </plain></SENT>
