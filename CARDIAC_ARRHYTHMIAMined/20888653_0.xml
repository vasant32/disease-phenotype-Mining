<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Young @ Heart is a multi-centre, randomised controlled study of a nurse-led, home-based intervention (HBI) program vs. usual care (UC) in privately insured patients in Australia aged ≥ 45 years following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intensity of HBI is tailored to an individual's clinical stability, management and risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause stay during a mean of 2.5 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A target of 602 adults (72% men) were randomised to HBI (n=306) or UC (n=296); their initial profiles being well matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At baseline, 71% were overweight (body mass index 29.7 ± 3.9 kg/m(2)) and 66% had an elevated blood pressure (153 ± 18/89 ± 7 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over half had a history of smoking and 39% had a sub-optimal total cholesterol level &gt;4 mmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, 62% (376 cases) were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (27% with multi-vessel disease and 39% underwent cardiac revascularisation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A further 20% (120 cases) were treated for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (predominantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) and 19% type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 7-14 days post-discharge, 293 (96%) HBI patients received a home visit triggering urgent clinical review and/or enhanced clinical management in many patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Young @ Heart intervention is a well accepted and potentially effective intervention to reduce recurrent hospital stay in privately insured cardiac patients in Australia </plain></SENT>
