<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advanced automated patch clamp technologies now allow for characterizing drug effects on multiple cardiac currents, enabling subsequent simulations of integrated electrophysiological responses on cellular, tissue and organ levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this issue, Mirams et al. summarize the strengths and limitations of models and simulations predicting drug-induced electrophysiological responses, emphasizing delayed repolarization and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> pro-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The utility of computational approaches is contingent upon realistic models of ventricular electrophysiology, robust characterization of drug-channel interactions and an understanding of channel-myocyte interactions and pro-arrhythmic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simulations evaluating effects on repolarization (hazard identification) should aid in selecting safer drug candidates early in drug discovery, while simulations evaluating risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> (incorporating known risk factors) should quantify pro-arrhythmic risk and reduce the need for costly clinical QT studies later in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The wider adoption of realistic models and simulation studies will depend on simulation performance compared with 'gold standard' clinical findings </plain></SENT>
