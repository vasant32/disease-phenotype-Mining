<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The primary objective of the CAMI-GUIDE study is to assess the predictive role of C-reactive protein for SCD or VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in ischaemic patients with the ejection fraction &lt;30% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional analyses incorporated cystatin-C and NT-ProBNP in multi-marker approach for the prediction of adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 300 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality at 2 years was 22.6%, mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was 8.3% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a competing risk multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline variables, no significant difference in primary endpoint was found between patients with C-reactive protein â‰¤3 vs. &gt;3 mg/L [heart rate (HR) 0.91 (0.50-1.64) P = 0.76], while C-reactive protein &gt;3 mg/L was strongly associated with mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> [HR: 3.17 (1.54-6.54) P = 0.002] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A risk function, including the three biomarkers, NYHA class and resting HR, allowed stratification of patient mortality risk from 5 to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: C-reactive protein &gt;3 mg/L is not associated with SCD or fast VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, however, is a strong predictor of HF mortality </plain></SENT>
