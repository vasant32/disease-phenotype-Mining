<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk of racing-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in Thoroughbred racehorses in the UK from 2000 to 2007, to identify whether there were risk factors uniquely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of racing-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> by identification of risk factors for such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> was defined as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> collapse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in an apparently healthy Thoroughbred racehorse, during or immediately after racing, in the absence of clinical data indicative of a catastrophic orthopaedic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The retrospective study included 201 case race starts and 705,712 control race starts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> at any one start </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the multivariable model, age, distance, race type, season and number of starts in the 60 days prior to the race were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors identified in this study are not uniquely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and have been also been identified in studies using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes of fatality as the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a generic approach to reduce fatal musculoskeletal injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> may be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The identification of risk factors allows speculation on the underlying mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in racing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may stimulate hypothesis-led investigations into the pathogenesis of exercise-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EIPH">exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage</z:e> and blood vessel rupture </plain></SENT>
