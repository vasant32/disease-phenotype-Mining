<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) is an accepted marker of risk for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, for which prognosis value has been established in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a very rare primary electrical disease carrying the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TWA in SQTS has not been evaluated yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with SQTS (QT = 308 ± 16 ms, QTc = 329 ± 10 ms, heart rate = 69 ± 8 beats/min) underwent microvolt TWA measurement using spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TWA testing was performed using Heartwave II (Cambridge Heart™, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) during bicycle exercice and classified as negative, positive, or indeterminate according to the published standards for clinical interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were male (mean age 23 ± 5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five were asymptomatic, three presented with aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and five with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients belonged to two unrelated families, while familial cases of SQTS were present for two other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A familial history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (SD) was present for seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>Ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> was inducible in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients were implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and one presented with polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TWA was negative in each but one patient (indeterminate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maximal negative heart rate was 118 ± 12 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with previous SD displayed significant shorter QT and higher resting heart rate compared to the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TWA testing is negative in 12 of 13 SQTS patients, even in the symptomatic or inducible ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Measurement of TWA using conventional protocol and criteria for risk stratification in SQTS seems therefore useless </plain></SENT>
