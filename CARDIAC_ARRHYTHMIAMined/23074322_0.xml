<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate an externally irrigated MRI-compatible ablation catheter and integrated EP pacing and recording system, testing the feasibility of pulmonary vein and cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Externally irrigated MRI-compatible ablation and diagnostic EP catheters and an integrated EP recording system (Imricor Medical Systems, Burnsville, MN) were tested in n=11 sheep in a 1.5-T MRI scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Power-controlled (40 W, 120-second duration) lesions were formed at the pulmonary vein and cavo-tricuspid isthmus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time intracardiac electrograms were recorded during MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Steady-state free precession non-breath-hold images were repeatedly acquired to guide catheter navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion visualization was performed using noncontrast (T2-weighted turbo spin echo pulse sequence) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-diethylene <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38751">triamine</z:chebi> pentaacetic acid-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (inversion-recovery gradient echo pulse sequence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catheters were able to be visualized and navigated under cardiovascular magnetic resonance guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In total, 8±2.5 lesions (radiofrequency time, 16±4.2 minutes) were formed at the pulmonary vein ostia, and 6.5±1.3 lesions (radiofrequency time, 13±2.2 minutes) were formed at the cavo-tricuspid isthmus, with the end point of bidirectional block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean procedure time was 150±55 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesion visualization with both T2W imaging and contrast-enhanced imaging correlated with sites of injury at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of using multiple catheters, an integrated EP pacing and recording system, and externally irrigated ablation with cardiovascular magnetic resonance guidance to undertake clinically relevant biatrial mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
