<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: In isolated rabbit hearts, repetitive endocardial focal discharges (REFDs) were consistently observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) with prolonged (&gt;5 minutes) global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (GI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that BAPTA-AM, a calcium <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi>, can suppress these REFDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a two-camera optical mapping system, we simultaneously mapped endocardial (left ventricle, LV) and epicardial (both ventricles) activations during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> with GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 5 hearts (protocol I), we infused Tyrode's solution (no BAPTA-AM) for ≥30 minutes before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of no-flow GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 additional hearts (protocol II), BAPTA-AM (20 μmol/L) was infused for ≥30 minutes before the initiation of GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In protocol I, sustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (&gt;30 seconds) was successfully induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 hearts with prolonged GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>REFDs were present in &gt;85 % of recording time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In protocol II, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was not inducible and REFDs were not observed after 5-minute GI in 5 hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effects of BAPTA-AM on intracellular calcium (Ca(i) ) at the LV endocardium were also evaluated in 5 hearts (protocol III) using dual Ca(i) /membrane potential mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GI, both without and with BAPTA-AM pretreatment, caused a decrease of Ca(i) amplitude during S(1) pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was more pronounced in the hearts with BAPTA-AM pretreatment (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GI, without BAPTA-AM pretreatment, caused broadening of Ca(i) transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, GI, with BAPTA-AM pretreatment, caused narrowing of Ca(i) transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAPTA-AM pretreatment attenuates Ca(i) transient, suppressing the genesis of REFDs and pacing-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> during GI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings support the notion that Ca(i) dynamics is important in the maintenance of REFDs.  </plain></SENT>
