<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, intrinsic ischemic tolerance may persist even in the pathologically altered hearts of hypertensive animals, and may be modified by short- or long-term adaptation to different stressful conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of long-term limitation of living space (ie, crowding stress [CS]) and brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced stress on cardiac response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) injury are not yet fully characterized in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to test the influence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress on the myocardial response to I/R in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with their effects in normotensive counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both groups, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, eight-week CS was induced by caging five rats per cage in cages designed for two rats (200 cm(2)/rat), while controls (C) were housed four to a cage in cages designed for six animals (480 cm(2)/rat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> stress was evoked by one cycle of I/R (5 min each, ischemic preconditioning) before sustained I/R in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts of normotensive and SHR rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline conditions, the effects of CS were manifested only as a further increase in blood pressure in SHR, and by marked limitation of coronary perfusion in normotensive animals, while no changes in heart mechanical function were observed in any of the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postischemic recovery of contractile function, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and lethal injury (infarction size) were worsened in the hypertrophied hearts of C-SHR compared with normotensive C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, myo-cardial stunning and reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were attenuated by CS in SHR, which was different from deterioration of I/R injury in the hearts of normotensive animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ischemic preconditioning conferred an effective protection against I/R in both groups, although the extent of anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and anti-arrhythmic effects was lower in SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both forms of stress may improve the altered response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in hypertensive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to short-term preconditioning stress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> psychosocial stress was associated with a higher risk of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and contractile failure in normotensive animals exposed to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic challenge </plain></SENT>
