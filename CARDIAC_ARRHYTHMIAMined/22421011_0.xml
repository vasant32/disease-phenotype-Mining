<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reviews have focused on the potential cardiac toxicity of the racemic drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="3724">Celexa</z:chebi>(®)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluating the safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> (Lexapro(®)) is an important issue to consider, since it is the S-enantiomer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">Escitalopram</z:chebi> has a small effect on the QTc interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prolonged QTc was seen in 2% to 14% of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> overdose cases, without serious cardiac sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The QTc prolongation effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> in beagle dogs has been attributed to the minor metabolite racemic didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whether the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> minor metabolite S-DDCT has this effect is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of S-DDCT are lower than DDCT, but for a broad range of doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi>, the S-DDCT and DDCT concentrations are well below the QTc prolonging concentrations reported in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no strong evidence from human and animal studies that the cardiac safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36791">escitalopram</z:chebi> is significantly superior to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
