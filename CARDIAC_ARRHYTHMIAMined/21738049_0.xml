<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, but few data are available on patients' characteristics and management in the context of Internal Medicine wards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected at the beginning of 2010 in 18 Internal Medicine units of the regions Liguria and Piemonte (Italy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each centre reviewed the hospital charts of the last 50 patients discharged during the year 2009 in whom a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had been made (patient's history or during the hospitalization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 903 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> among patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine units was 18.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than 85% of patients had at least two diseases other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and 'lone' <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was rare (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During hospital stay, 80.5% of the patients received at least one treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>: 55.5% received an antithrombotic and 61.8% a drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, mostly aimed at rate control (47.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 13.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At discharge, 70.2 and 68.9% of the patients received prescription of a drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and for antithrombotic treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prescription of oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while previous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, age above 75 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, male sex and a number of concomitant drugs of more than four were strong negative predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data from our study confirm that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is a common finding in patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine units, and this population is characterized by multiple comorbidities and severe prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies exist between recommendations by guidelines and real-world management, owing to the complexity of patients and limits of existing treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
