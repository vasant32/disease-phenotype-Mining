<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the series of RR intervals are normally carefully edited before HRV is analysed, but this is a time consuming procedure when 24-hours recordings are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, different methods can be used for automatic removal of arrhythmic beats and artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study compared common frequency domain indices of HRV when determined from manually edited and automatically filtered RR intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four hours Holter recordings were available from 140 healthy subjects of age 1-75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An experienced technician carefully edited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Automatic filtering was performed using a recursive procedure where RR intervals were removed if they differed from the mean of the surrounding RR intervals with more than a predetermined limit (ranging from 10% to 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The filtering algorithm was evaluated by replacing 1% of the beats with synthesised ectopic beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Power spectral analysis was performed before and after filtering of both the original edited data and the noisy data set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results from the analysis using the noisy data were used to define an age-based filtering threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age-based filtration was evaluated with completely unedited data, generated by removing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> annotations from the series of RR intervals, and then comparing the resulting HRV indices with those obtained using edited data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results showed equivalent results after age-based filtration of both the edited and unedited data sets, where the differences in HRV indices obtained by different preprocessing methods were small compared to the mean values within each age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that it might not be necessary to perform the time-consuming careful editing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected heartbeats before HRV is analysed in Holter recordings.In most subjects, it is sufficient to perform the regular editing needed for valid <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> analyses, and then remove undetected ectopic beats and artefacts by age-based filtration of the series of RR intervals, particularly in subjects older than 30 years </plain></SENT>
