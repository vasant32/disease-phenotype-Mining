<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 98 females and 37 males, with a mean age of 22.92 ± 17.46 years (range, 3-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prevent myocardial dysfunction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> caused by the conventional technique, the operation was performed with a beating heart under cardiopulmonary bypass in 63 cases, and compared the data retrospectively with cases treated under aortic crossclamping, to determine the safety of the beating-heart technique and to evaluate risk factors for embolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient age and size of defect were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and no residual shunt in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 36.84 ± 9.8 min in the beating-heart group and 43.13 ± 16.7 min in the crossclamp group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ejection fraction and the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in blood products transfused, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, or perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experience, the results of the beating-heart technique were not different from the conventional technique </plain></SENT>
