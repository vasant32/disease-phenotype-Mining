<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Although the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel locus SCN10A has been implicated by genome-wide association studies as a modulator of cardiac electrophysiology, the role of its gene product Nav1.8 as a modulator of cardiac ion currents is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We determined the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of Nav1.8 in heterologous cell systems and assessed the antiarrhythmic effect of Nav1.8 block on isolated mouse and rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We first demonstrated that Scn10a transcripts are identified in mouse heart and that the blocker A-803467 is highly specific for Nav1.8 current over that of Nav1.5, the canonical cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel encoded by SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then showed that low concentrations of A-803467 selectively block "late" <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current and shorten action potentials in mouse and rabbit cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exaggerated late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current is known to mediate arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations in heart, and these were similarly suppressed by low concentrations of A-803467 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Scn10a expression contributes to late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current in heart and represents a new target for antiarrhythmic intervention </plain></SENT>
