<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that multilevel measurement of several inflammatory proteins in AF patients would help assess the extent and the source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with paroxysmal AF, 33 with persistent AF, and 9 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001716'>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral, left atrial, coronary sinus, and pulmonary vein blood samples were obtained during catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 (sICAM-1), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were measured at the four sampled sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-8, sICAM-1, and TGF-β1 levels did not differ among groups at any of the sampled sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral VEGF levels were higher in both paroxysmal and persistent AF patients than in controls (P ≤ 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left atrial VEGF levels were higher in paroxysmal AF (P = 0.05), but not in persistent AF (P = 0.32), compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coronary sinus and pulmonary vein VEGF levels did not differ significantly among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of several inflammatory markers in both paroxysmal and persistent AF patients suggest that the inflammatory process is of low grade, if present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the context of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pulmonary vein VEGF levels, the heart itself is the most likely source of high left atrial VEGF levels in paroxysmal AF patients; however, this disorder appears to be a transient event in the natural history of AF </plain></SENT>
