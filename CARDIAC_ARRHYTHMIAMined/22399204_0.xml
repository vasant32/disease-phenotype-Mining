<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, CRT may be under-utilized in women and data on long-term follow-up are still scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to investigate long-term mortality and hospitalization and prognostic impact of gender after CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on 619 consecutive patients (19% women) that received CRT at a single centre between 1998 and 2008 were collected from electronic medical records and national <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and hospitalization registries up to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause and the secondary endpoint was combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 1320 Â± 786 days, 215 (35%) patients reached the primary endpoint and 437 (71%) the secondary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 91, 63, and 39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Female gender was the only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality; hazard ratio (HR) 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.90; P= 0.025] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women also had a trend towards lower risk for the secondary endpoint, HR 0.68 (95% CI, 0.45-1.04; P= 0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this registry analysis, patients with CRT had similarly high short-term survival to those in controlled trials, and this favourable prognosis was sustained over the long term.Women had lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality than men </plain></SENT>
