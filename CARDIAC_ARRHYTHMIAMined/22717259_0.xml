<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to assess ventricular dimensions, exercise capability, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of patients operated for secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> and compare the results with those in healthy references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 78 consecutive patients underwent surgical closure for a secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> between 1990 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 42 patients were included and underwent a cross-sectional evaluation including echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, exercise testing, and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were matched with healthy controls for gender, body surface area, and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 4.6 plus or minus 2.8 years, and the mean age at follow-up was 16 plus or minus 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no residual intracardiac lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean right ventricular end-systolic volume was significantly larger in patients (142 ± 26 millilitres) than in references (137 ± 28 millilitres; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 25% of the patients, right ventricular end-systolic volume was larger than the 95th percentile for references </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exercise testing did not reveal differences with healthy references: maximal power (169 ± 43 Watt patients versus 172 ± 53 controls; p = 0.8), maximal oxygen uptake (38 ± 8 versus 41 ± 13 millilitres per minute per kilogram; p = 0.1).CommentAfter surgical closure of secundum-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo>, right ventricular end-systolic volume is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have no impact on rhythm status or exercise capacity at this stage of follow-up, but may have implications for the timing of surgery or the technique of closure if confirmed in longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
