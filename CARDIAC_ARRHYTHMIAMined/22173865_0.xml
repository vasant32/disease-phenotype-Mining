<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>Sleep apnea</z:hpo> (SA) has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and has been found to be a predictor of AF recurrence after successful pulmonary vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No investigations have been carried out to determine the prevalence of SA in patients with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) and the impact of SA on AFL recurrence after AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to determine if SA is a predictor of recurrence of AFL and/or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients who have undergone AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study used a retrospective electronic chart review analysis of consecutive right-sided isthmus-dependent AFL referred for ablation over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were classified as AFL, AF, or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SA prevalence was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 122 consecutive patients undergoing AFL ablation between January 2008 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 28.3 ±��6.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Males were 75.4%, had a mean age of 68.3 ± 10.4 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> 65%, and structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of SA was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of AFL was observed in 9.8%, recurrence of AF was observed in 22.1%, and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> 4.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SA was not a predictor of AFL recurrence (6.1% vs. 11.2%; p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SA was neither a predictor of AF nor of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Variables associated with AFL recurrence were: no history of preablation antiarrhythmic drugs (18.8% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.04) and lower BMI (27.07 kg/m(2) vs. 30.87 kg/m(2); p =��0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of SA in patients with AFL was 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SA was not found to be a predictor of AFL recurrence after successful AFL ablation </plain></SENT>
