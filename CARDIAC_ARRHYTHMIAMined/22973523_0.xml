<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the exercise performance of young patients following the repair of TOF and to assess the influence of different variables related to the surgical repair on exercise testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted on 21 patients (16 males and 5 females) operated on for TOF compared to 15 healthy age- and sex-matched control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients' median age at time of the study was 8 years (range 5-13 years) while age at surgical repair was 5 Â± 2.1 years (range 2-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were subjected to 2D and color Doppler echocardiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treadmill exercise stress testing was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects according to modified Bruce protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resting ECGs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cases had lower exercise capacity when compared to control subjects and those with aortopulmonary shunt showed significantly lower exercise performance when compared to those without aortopulmonary shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusions, exercise tolerance after total correction of TOF is slightly impaired on short-term followup with more affection among patients with previous aortopulmonary shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study did not reveal any serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
