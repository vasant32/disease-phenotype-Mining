<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> is a presentation of an inflammatory reaction of the heart during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo>, with most cases seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is of great significance because of the likelihood of progression to severe and potentially fatal complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation of the disease is silent leading to delayed diagnosis when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> has already advanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a major issue is whether the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> will continue to require invasive procedures such as endomyocardial biopsy or can be achieved with non-invasive methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is increasing evidence that noninvasive cardiac imaging, including tissue Doppler echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), is able to detect subclinical cases and aid in the initiation of specific treatment when it is more likely to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CMR in particular, has emerged as an important technique in the evaluation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> using three types of images: T2-weighted (T2-W), early T1-weighted (EGE) images taken after 1 min, and delayed enhanced images (LGE) taken 15 min after the injection of contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If 2/3 of the imaging sequences are positive, myocardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> can be predicted or ruled out with a diagnostic accuracy of 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As our understanding of disease mechanisms improves, multimodality imaging may aid in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this potentially devastating complication of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, but further studies are needed to formally evaluate this </plain></SENT>
