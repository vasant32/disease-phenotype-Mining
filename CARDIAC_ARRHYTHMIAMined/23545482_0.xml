<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antecedant-focused strategies learned in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), such as cognitive reappraisal, have proven more effective for reducing social <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> than response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Still, not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SAD respond well to CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medications and physiological factors may also influence the clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine the role that these factors play in determining treatment response following CBT for SAD.Using multilevel modeling, we examined associations across four separate laboratory visits between change in self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and indices of reappraisal, suppression, medication status, and resting respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), a proxy measure of self-regulatory capacity, in 23 socially anxious adults during a 12-week program of CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most participants were ultimately classified as responders to CBT (n = 15), but in some, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> levels remained unchanged (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Medication use explained substantial variance related to individual differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> among participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When modelled separately, reappraisal, suppression, and RSA each accounted for significant variance related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the best-fitting model included reappraisal and RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RSA reactivity (change in RSA levels over time) was more important for predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> reduction than were baseline levels of RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that reappraisal and parasympathetic responsiveness may be important in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in adults with SAD who respond well to CBT </plain></SENT>
