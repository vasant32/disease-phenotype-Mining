<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between three valid, reproducible and commonly methods used to assess cardiac vagal modulation and compare their accuracies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty healthy men (23 ± 4 years) and 15 men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (61 ± 10 years) were evaluated in counterbalanced design by Heart Rate Variability (HRV; variables: the time domain = pNN50, SDNN and RMSSD, the frequency domain HF = ms² and HF n.u.), Respiratory Sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and 4-second Exercise Test (T4s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty healthy men (23 ± 4 years) and 15 men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (61 ± 10 years) were evaluated in counterbalanced order by Heart Rate Variability (HRV; variables: the time domain = pNN50, SDNN and RMSSD, the frequency domain HF = ms² and HF n.u.), Respiratory Sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) and 4-second Exercise Test (T4s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Healthy subjects had higher vagal modulation by the three methods (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation in the healthy group (p &lt;0.05) between the results of HRV (SDNN and pNN50 and RSA, but there was no correlation between the T4s and the other two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, there was a correlation between the results of HRV (pNN50, SDNN, RMSSD, HF ms² and HF n.u.) and RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a correlation between the RSA and T4s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the T4s and RSA methods presented more accurate effect size and better accuracy (p &lt;0.05), when compared to the HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HRV and RSA generated partially redundant results in healthy subjects and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, while the T4s generated results that were complementary to HRV and RSA in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, RSA and T4s methods were more accurate when discriminating cardiac vagal modulation between healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, when compared to HRV </plain></SENT>
