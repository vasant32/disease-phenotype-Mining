<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent research suggests that impaired voltage-gated ion channels in dystrophic cardiomyocytes accompany cardiac pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is, however, unknown if the ion <z:mp ids='MP_0003484'>channel defects</z:mp> are primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations, or secondary effects of the developing cardiac pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address this question, we first investigated <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel impairments in cardiomyocytes derived from dystrophic neonatal mice prior to cardiomyopahty development, by using the whole cell patch clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides the most common model for DMD, the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse, we also used mice additionally carrying an utrophin mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In neonatal cardiomyocytes, dystrophin-deficiency generated a 25% reduction in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, extra utrophin-deficiency significantly altered <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel gating parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, also calcium channel inactivation was considerably reduced in dystrophic neonatal cardiomyocytes, suggesting that ion channel abnormalities are universal primary effects of dystrophic gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To assess developmental changes, we also studied <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel impairments in cardiomyocytes derived from dystrophic adult mice, and compared them with the respective abnormalities in dystrophic neonatal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we found a much stronger <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current reduction in adult cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The described <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel impairments slowed the upstroke of the action potential in adult cardiomyocytes, and only in dystrophic adult mice, the QRS interval of the electrocardiogram was prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ion channel impairments precede pathology development in the dystrophic heart, and may thus be considered potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> triggers </plain></SENT>
