<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Current ablation consensus documents define persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) as AF lasting &gt;1 week to 1 year or AF requiring cardioversion or pharmacologic conversion in &lt;1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These 2 persistent AF subgroups may have different clinical characteristics and ablation outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared 179 patients whose persistent AF was always terminated in &lt;1 week by cardioversion/drugs to 244 whose AF actually lasted &gt;1 week to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF termination in &lt;1 week by cardioversion/drugs had smaller left atrial (LA) size (4.1 ± 0.6 vs 4.5 ± 0.7 cm, p &lt;0.0001), a longer AF history (7.5 ± 7.5 vs 6.0 ± 7.2 years, p = 0.035), more failed drugs (1.6 ± 1.0 vs 1.3 ± 1.0, p = 0.004), lower body mass index (28.5 ± 5.5 vs 30.3 ± 5.5, p = 0.0008), and fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> (3.9% vs 11.1%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox multivariate analysis showed that LA size (p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) predict ablation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a linear relation between duration of longest AF episode and LA size (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Longest AF episode duration was the only factor predicting LA size (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed more patients with AF termination in &lt;1 week by cardioversion/drugs were free of AF after ablation (p = 0.042) than those whose AF actually lasted &gt;1 week to 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Once AF lasted &gt;1 week, duration up to 1 year did not affect ablation success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients whose persistent AF is always terminated by drugs/cardioversion in &lt;1 week have different clinical characteristics and better ablation outcomes than patients whose AF persists beyond 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that maintaining sinus rhythm before ablation is beneficial and that the definition of AF2 may need revision </plain></SENT>
