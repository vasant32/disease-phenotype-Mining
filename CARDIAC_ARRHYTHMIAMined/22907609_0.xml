<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its effect in laparoscopic renal surgery has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> on the length of hospital stay, readiness for discharge, opioid requirement, bowel function and inflammatory and stress response after laparoscopic renal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Single tertiary centre where the study was carried out between July 2009 and February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were laparoscopic renal surgery and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were steroid therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> opioid therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel dysfunction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> was given as a 1.5 mg kg(-1) bolus during induction of anaesthesia, followed by an intraoperative infusion of 2 and 1.3 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 24 h postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were readiness for discharge, opioid consumption, sedation, incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (PONV), return of bowel function and inflammatory and stress responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The length of hospital stay did not differ between the groups [6 days for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> group, interquartile range (IQR) 5 to 7, range 2 to 8 vs. 5 days for the placebo group, IQR 5 to 6, range 2 to 11; P = 0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> had no effect on readiness for discharge [4 days for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> group (IQR 5 to 7, range 2 to 8) vs. 4 days for the placebo group (IQR 5 to 7, range 2 to 11); P = 0.26], opioid consumption, postoperative sedation, PONV, return of bowel function and plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Systemic perioperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> administration over 24 h did not influence the length of the hospital stay, readiness for discharge, opioid consumption, return of bowel function or inflammatory and stress responses after laparoscopic renal surgery </plain></SENT>
