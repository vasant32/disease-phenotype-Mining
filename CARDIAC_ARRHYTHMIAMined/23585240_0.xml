<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the safety and efficacy of the use of dabigatran in the peri-procedural period for radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of AF is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dabigatran in the peri-procedural period for RFCA of AF and the duration of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 227) who underwent RFCA for AF were prospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peri-procedural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy with dabigatran (n = 101, D group) was compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> bridging (n = 126, W group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran was discontinued 12-24 h before and restarted 3 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was stopped 3 days before the procedure and unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in one patient of the D group (0.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> in each group and one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> in the W group, p = 0.93) or minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (five cases in the D group vs. five in the W group, p = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the D group than in the W group (7.2 vs. 10.3 days, p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peri-procedural anticoagulation therapy with dabigatran for RFCA of AF was equally safe and effective compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> bridging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of dabigatran for RFCA of AF shortened the duration of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
