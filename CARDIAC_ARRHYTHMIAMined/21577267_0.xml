<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high efficacy of PVAI is partially undermined by a small but concrete periprocedural risk of complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A correct management of anticoagulation is essential to prevent such complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Performing PVAI without interruption of oral anticoagulation has been demonstrated feasible by our group in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that continuation of therapeutic <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> during radiofrequency catheter ablation consistently reduces the risk of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> without increasing the risk of hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, interrupting <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation may actually increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even when bridged with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter strategy is also associated with an increased risk of minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With regard to major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, we found no significant difference between patients with a therapeutic INR and those who were bridged with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, continuation of therapeutic <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> during ablation of AF appears to be the best anticoagulation strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this paper we summarize our experience with AF ablation without interruption of anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
