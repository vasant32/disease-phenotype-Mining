<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were 251 children reporting on marital conflict, baseline RSA, and RSA reactivity (RSA-R) to a lab challenge were recorded, and fluid cognitive performance was measured using the Woodcock-Johnson III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cross-lagged model showed that higher levels of marital conflict at age 8 predicted weaker RSA-R at age 9 for children with lower baseline RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A growth model showed that lower baseline RSA in conjunction with weaker RSA-R predicted the slowest development of fluid cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest that stress may affect development of physiological systems regulating attention, which are tied to the development of fluid cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
