<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The arrhythmogenic potential of short QT intervals has recently been highlighted in patients with a short QT syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug-induced QT-interval prolongation is a known risk factor for ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, reports on drug-induced QT-interval shortening are rare and proarrhythmic effects remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, rufinamide, a new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug for the add-on treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e>, was approved in the European Union and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial trials showed drug-induced QT-interval shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of rufinamide on QT intervals in patients with difficult-to-treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0477371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other epilepsy</z:e> syndromes were included (n = 12 men; mean age 41 ± 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QRS, QT, and T(peak)-T(end) intervals were analyzed before and during rufinamide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean QT interval shortened significantly following rufinamide administration (QT interval 349 ± 23 ms vs 327 ± 17 ms; corrected QT interval 402 ± 22 ms vs 382 ± 16 ms; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T(peak)-T(end) intervals were 79 ± 17 ms before and 70 ± 20 ms on treatment (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean reduction of the corrected QT interval was 20 ± 18 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (3.04 ± 1.09 years), no adverse events including symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac deaths</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QTc-interval shortening following oral rufinamide administration in a small patient group was not associated with significant clinical adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These observations notwithstanding, the ability of rufinamide to significantly shorten the QT interval portends a potential arrhythmogenic risk that may best be guarded against by periodic electrocardiographic recordings </plain></SENT>
