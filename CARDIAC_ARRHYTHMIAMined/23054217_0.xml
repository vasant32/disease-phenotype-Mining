<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The prerequisite for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is ventricular capture, which may be verified by analysis of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few algorithms exist to diagnose loss of ventricular capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrocardiograms from 126 CRT patients were analysed during biventricular (BV), right ventricular (RV), and left ventricular (LV) pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An algorithm evaluating QRS narrowing in the limb leads and increasing negativity in lead I to diagnose changes in ventricular capture was devised, prospectively validated, and compared with two existing algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance of the algorithm according to ventricular lead position was also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our algorithm had an accuracy of 88% to correctly identify the changes in ventricular capture (either loss or gain of RV or LV capture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The algorithm had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 96% with an accuracy of 96% for identifying loss of LV capture (the most clinically relevant change), and compared favourably with the existing algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Performance of the algorithms was not significantly affected by RV or LV lead position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A simple two-step algorithm evaluating QRS width in the limb leads and changes in negativity in lead I can accurately diagnose the lead responsible for intermittent loss of ventricular capture in CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This simple tool may be of particular use outside the setting of specialized device clinics </plain></SENT>
