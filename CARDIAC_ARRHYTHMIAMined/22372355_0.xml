<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate MPO as a predictor of in-hospital mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients treated by primary PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study population consisted of 189 STEMI patients having undergone primary PCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma MPO level was measured 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostics, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was performed to identify the most useful MPO cut-off level for the prediction of in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the cut-off MPO level: high MPO group (&gt; or = 840 pmol/L, n = 65) and low MPO group (&lt; 840 pmol/L, n = 124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The high MPO group had significantly more frequent anterior wall infarctions (p &lt; 0.001) and Killip class &gt; 1 on admission (p = 0.013) as well as lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.011) and higher B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) (p = 0.029) than the low MPO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 5.8% and was significantly higher in the high MPO group (13.8%) than in the low MPO group (1.6%) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the plasma MPO level as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 3.88, 95% CI 1.13 - 13.34, p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MPO level independently predicts in-hospital mortality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> patients treated by primary PCI </plain></SENT>
