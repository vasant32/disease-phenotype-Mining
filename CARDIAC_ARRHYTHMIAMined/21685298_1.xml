<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available regarding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> effects of delivering radiofrequency in the vicinity of large coronary vessels, and the long-term impact of this approach for mapping and ablation on epicardial vessel integrity is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> histopathologic changes produced by in vivo epicardial pulses of radiofrequency ablation on coronary artery of porcine hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven pigs underwent a left thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The catheter was sutured adjacent to the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery, and 20 pulses of radiofrequency energy were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency lesions located no more than 1 mm of the vessel were used for this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three animals were euthanized 20 days (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase) after the procedure and 4 animals after 70 days (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were obtained in each vessel analyzed: (1) internal and external perimeter; (2) vessel wall thickness; (3) tunica media thickness, and (4) tunica intima thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries, the distance between the artery and the epicardium, and the anatomic relationship of the artery with the coronary vein was also documented for each section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 20 (80%) sections analyzed, showed intimal thickening with a mean of 0.18 ± 0.14 mm compared with 0.13 ± 0.16 mm in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase (P = 0.331) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean tunica media thickness was 0.25 ± 0.10 mm in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase animals compared with 0.18 ± 0.03 mm in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase animals (P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A clear protective effect of pericardial fat and coronary veins was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between depth of radiofrequency lesion and the degree of vessel injury expressed as intimal and media thickening (P = 0.001) was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was identified (r = -0.83; P = 0.002) between intimal thickening and distance between epicardium and coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this porcine model of in vivo epicardial radiofrequency ablation in proximity to coronary arteries leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> histopathologic changes characterized by tunica intima and media thickening, with replacement of smooth muscle cells with extracellular matrix, but no significant stenosis was observed up to 70 days after the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> or injury does not preclude subsequent significant arterial damage, which frequently occurs when epicardial radiofrequency applications are delivered in close vicinity to the vessels </plain></SENT>
