<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acidic pH inhibits hERG channel maximal conductance and accelerates deactivation, likely by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying the loss of conductance has not been demonstrated and is the focus of the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data presented demonstrate that, unlike in other voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (Kv) channels, substitution of individual histidine residues did not abolish the pH dependence of hERG channel conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abolition of inactivation, by the mutation S620T, also did not affect the proton sensitivity of channel conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Instead, voltage-dependent channel inhibition (Î´ = 0.18) indicative of pore block was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a fast block of the pore, hERG S620T single channel data showed an apparent reduction of the single channel current amplitude at low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of protons was relieved by elevating external <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> and could be modified by charge introduction within the outer pore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data strongly suggest that extracellular protons inhibit hERG maximal conductance by blocking the external channel pore </plain></SENT>
