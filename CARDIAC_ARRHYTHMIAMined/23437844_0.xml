<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is undertaken as a potentially curative treatment for a variety of heart rhythm disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated improved quality of life and reduced symptoms after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In many health care environments waiting lists exist for scheduling of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the psychological effects of waiting for radiofrequency ablation have not previously been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that waiting for this intervention may be associated with increased psychological morbidity and health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two patients scheduled for elective RFA completed repeated questionnaires comprising the Medical Outcomes Short Form 36, Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, and an in-house questionnaire designed to assess the burden of symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related burden score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean scores were generated and compared at time points while waiting, before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses were carried out to identify predictors of increased psychological morbidity while waiting and immediately prior to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Health care costs during the waiting period as a consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean scores for parameters of psychological morbidity worsened during the period of waiting and improved after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Predictors of adverse effects within the cohort varied according to the time point assessed for each of the measures of psychological morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A conservative estimate of the health care cost incurred while waiting exceeds Â£181 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Waiting for radiofrequency ablation appears to be associated with adverse psychological effects and health care costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results may support strategies to reduce waiting times and prioritize resource allocation </plain></SENT>
