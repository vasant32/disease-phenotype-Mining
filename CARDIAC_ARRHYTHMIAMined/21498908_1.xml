<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is considered to promote arrhythmogenic substrates in diseased model animals, it is difficult to evaluate its primary role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the promotion of arrhythmogenic substrates in the primary hyperoxidative state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO, 30 mmol · L(-1) · day(-1)) for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On day 7 or 14, the serum levels of derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) were measured, and immune staining of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8O HdG) was performed to assess <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ventricular effective refractory period (ERP), monophasic action potential duration (MAPD), and the inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BSO rats exhibited higher serum d-ROM and clearer 8OHdG staining than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was higher in the BSO rats than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ERP was shorter in the BSO rats than the control (day 14, 32 ± 1 vs. 36 ± 1 ms, P&lt;0.05), whereas the MAPD(90) was longer in the BSO rats (day 14, 76 ± 5 vs. 55 ± 4 ms, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Kv4.2, erg, and SERCA2a were downregulated in the BSO rats (P &lt; 0.05), and Western blot analysis exhibited the downregulation of erg and SERCA2 expression in the BSO rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> might be one of the primary factors promoting cardiac electrophysiological remodeling and increasing the inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> independently of major organ disorders </plain></SENT>
