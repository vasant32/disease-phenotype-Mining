<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> have been described frequently and studied systematically; however, these changes were not investigated thoroughly in patients with intracranial parenchymal haemorrhage (IPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electrocardiograms (ECGs) and medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraparynchemal haemorrhage (IPH) between 2006 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 160 patients (56% males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 71 years (interquartile range (IQR) 59 to 80) and 69% were above the age of 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients were hypertensive (81%).The majority of patients (86%) had at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight (43%) patients had T-wave inversion and 65 (41%) had QTc interval prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between QTc prolongation and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> size and the presence of midline shift; odd ratios were 2.8 (CI 1.4 to 5.5; P 0.003) and 2.2 (CI 1.1 to 4.2; P 0.04), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> was found to be significantly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (OR 4.1; CI 1.3 to 12.8; P 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> are a common finding in patients with IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repolarizaion abnormalities occur the most frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>QTc prolongation was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> size and midline shift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
