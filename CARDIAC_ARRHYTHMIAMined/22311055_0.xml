<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Forty-three HH and 21 volunteer control subjects who were asymptomatic underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using the Bruce protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AEC was assessed with minute ventilation (V(E)), oxygen uptake (V(O)(2)), and carbon dioxide production (V(CO)(2)) at baseline and at a follow-up assessment after 5 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A paired t test was used for analyses of normality data; otherwise, Wilcoxon's signed rank-sum test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three HH subjects and 18 volunteer control subjects returned for a repeat cardiopulmonary exercise testing at the fifth-year follow-up (80% overall return rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the fifth-year follow-up, AEC was not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline measurements, exercise time, peak V(O)(2), and the V(E)/V(CO)(2) slope did not differ statistically at the fifth-year follow-up between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Iron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> through phlebotomy for 5 yrs did not significantly affect AEC in newly diagnosed HH subjects at baseline (n = 14) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> during exercise tended to decrease after 5 yrs of therapy in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AEC of asymptomatic HH subjects treated using conventional therapy is not statistically affected by the disease during a 5-yr period </plain></SENT>
