<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported electrocardiogram characteristics during outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> that helped distinguish VT related to ARVD/C from idiopathic VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To prospectively validate these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We created a risk score by using a derivation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two experienced electrophysiologists blinded to the diagnosis prospectively scored patients with VT/<z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo>/inferior axis pattern in a validation cohort of 37 ARVD/C tracings and 49 idiopathic VT tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with ARVD/C had their diagnosis confirmed based on the revised task force criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic VT were selected based on structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts with documented right ventricular outflow tract VT successfully treated with ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The scoring system provides 3 points for sinus rhythm anterior T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3 and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>: 2 points for QRS duration in lead Iâ‰¥120 ms, 2 points for QRS notching, and 1 point for precordial transition at lead V5 or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A score of 5 or greater was able to correctly distinguish ARVD/C from idiopathic VT 93% of the time, with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We describe a simple scoring algorithm that uses 12-lead electrocardiogram characteristics to effectively distinguish right ventricular outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from patients with ARVD/C versus patients with idiopathic VT </plain></SENT>
