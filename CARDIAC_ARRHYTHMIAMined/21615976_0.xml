<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Classical Atriopulmonary Fontan connections tend to fail in the long term due to progressive anastomotic site obstruction, right atrial enlargement, and refractory atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversion to total cavopulmonary connection with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery is a promising treatment but optimal timing of the procedure remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between the years 2002 and 2009, 15 patients with a median age of 26.2 (12-43) years underwent Fontan conversion operation with concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were symptomatic and 14 out of the 15 patients had refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of pre-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and the outcome of surgery were correlated to study the impact of delay in surgical intervention on post-operative survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two patients who died in the early post-operative period (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the mid-term follow-up, 53 (20-86) months, late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> had recurred in two of the 13 surviving patients (15.30%) and one patient developed late sinus node dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The need for anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased considerably from 93.5% to 15.3% on mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or need for cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> before surgery was prolonged for more than 10 years in patients who died as well as in those who had complications like late recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, dependence on anti-arrhythmic medications, and worsening of ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fontan conversion is a well-established treatment option for salvaging the failing atriopulmonary connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery effectively resolves the refractory atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and improves survival, but we need to optimise the timing of Fontan conversion to improve the long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
