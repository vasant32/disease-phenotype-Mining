<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological remodeling of failing hearts sets the stage for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, in which the role of the late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (I(NaL)) is relevant and is currently under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the role of I(NaL) in the electrophysiological phenotype of ventricular myocytes, and its proarrhythmic effects in the failing heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A model for cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> was proposed using a modified version of Grandi et al. model for human ventricular action potential that incorporates the formulation of I(NaL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed and simulations of the pathological electrical activity of the cell were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed model for the human I(NaL) and the electrophysiological remodeling of myocytes from failing hearts accurately reproduce experimental observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity analysis of the modulation of electrophysiological parameters of myocytes from failing hearts due to ion channels remodeling, revealed a role for I(NaL) in the prolongation of action potential duration (APD), triangulation of the shape of the AP, and changes in Ca(2+) transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mechanistic investigation of intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> accumulation and APD shortening with increasing frequency of stimulation of failing myocytes revealed a role for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> pump, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger and I(NaL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the simulations also showed that in failing myocytes, the enhancement of I(NaL) increased the reverse rate-dependent APD prolongation and the probability of initiating early afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological remodeling of failing hearts and especially the enhancement of the I(NaL) prolong APD and alter Ca(2+) transient facilitating the development of early afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An enhanced I(NaL) appears to be an important contributor to the electrophysiological phenotype and to the dysregulation of [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis of failing myocytes </plain></SENT>
