<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (HAVB) is a frequent complication in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> associated with an increased rate of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence and clinical significance of HAVB in late convalescent phases of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and prognostic value of late HAVB documented by continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients with reduced left ventricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 286 patients from the CARISMA study with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An insertable loop recorder was implanted 5 to 21 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> for incessant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ECG documentation was supplemented by a 24-hour Holter monitoring conducted at week 6 post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of HAVB occurring more than 21 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> was examined with respect to development of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events and major ventricular tachyarrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 1.9 years (interquartile range 0.9-2.0), late HAVB was documented in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> events (hazard ratio [HR] 4.08 [1.38-12.09], P = .01) and major ventricular tachyarrhythmic events (HR = 5.41 [1.88-15.58], P = .002) were significantly increased in patients who developed late HAVB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> documented by continuous ECG monitoring occurring more than 3 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> is a frequent complication in post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patients with left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HAVB is associated with ominous prognostic implications of both potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
