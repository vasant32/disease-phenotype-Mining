<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the outset, we present a brief historical overview regarding reentry and then discuss the basic concepts and terminologies pertaining to rotors and their initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the intrinsic properties of rotors and spiral waves, including phase singularities, wavefront curvature, and dominant frequency maps, are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The implications of rotor dynamics for the spatiotemporal organization of <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>, independent of the species being studied, are described next </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The knowledge gained regarding the role of cardiac structure in the initiation or maintenance of rotors and the ionic bases of spiral waves in the past 2 decades, as well as the significance for drug therapy, is reviewed subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude by examining recent evidence suggesting that rotors are critical in sustaining both atrial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> in the human heart and its implications for treatment with radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
