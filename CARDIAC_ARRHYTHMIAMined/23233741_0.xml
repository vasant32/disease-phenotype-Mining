<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively examined the association between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on the risk of SCD among 101 018 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at baseline 1980 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 30 years of follow-up, we identified 351 SCD events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a 2.44-fold (95% CI, 1.80-3.31) increased risk of SCD after controlling for coronary risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analyses, quantity of cigarettes smoked daily (P value for trend, &lt;0.0001) and smoking duration (P value for trend, &lt;0.0001) were linearly associated with SCD risk among current smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small-to-moderate amounts of cigarette consumption (1-14 per day) were associated with a significant 1.84-fold (95% CI, 1.16-2.92) increase in SCD risk and every 5 years of continued smoking was associated with an 8% increase in SCD risk (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SCD risk linearly decreased over time after quitting and was equivalent to that of a never smoker after 20 years of cessation (P value for trend, &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort of women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> at baseline, a strong dose-response relationship between cigarette smoking and SCD risk was observed, and smoking cessation significantly reduced and eventually eliminated excess SCD risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests efforts to prevent SCD among women should include aggressive strategies for smoking cessation </plain></SENT>
