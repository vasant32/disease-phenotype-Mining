<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) accounts for up to half of cardiac mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of SCD is heritable but the underlying genetic variants are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether common genetic variants predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or related electrocardiographic phenotypes, including QT-interval prolongation, are associated with increased risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied the association between 28 candidate SNPs and SCD in a meta-analysis of four population cohorts (FINRISK 1992, 1997, 2002 and Health 2000, n = 27,629) and two forensic autopsy series (The Helsinki <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden Death</z:hpo> Study and The Tampere Autopsy Study, n = 694) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied the association between established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were reviewed using registry-based health and autopsy data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression and logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and geographic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total number of SCDs was 716 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two novel SNPs were associated with SCD: SCN5A rs41312391 (relative risk [RR] 1.27 per minor T allele, 95% CI 1.11-1.45, P = 3.4×10(-4)) and rs2200733 in 4q25 (RR 1.28 per minor T allele, 95% CI 1.11-1.48, P = 7.9×10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also replicated the associations for 9p21 (rs2383207, RR 1.13 per G allele, 95% CI 1.01-1.26, P = 0.036), as well as for male sex, systolic blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cigarette smoking, low physical activity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and digoxin use (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Two novel genetic variants, one in the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel gene SCN5A and another at 4q25 previously associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, are associated with SCD </plain></SENT>
