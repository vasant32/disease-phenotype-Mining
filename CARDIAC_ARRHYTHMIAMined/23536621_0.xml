<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon investigations a retained fragment of a pulmonary artery catheter was found in the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Throughout the years between his accident and the current presentation he did not have any symptoms or signs of complications associated with the retained catheter such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon presenting his case at the medical/surgical multidisciplinary meeting it was decided that the probability of complications occurring at this stage was low as the catheter fragment would have endothelialised and the risk of retrieval would outweigh the benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This scenario highlighted the importance of understanding the possible long-term complications of retained catheter fragments, the importance of being aware of the limitation of these devices and the need to be more vigilant in the emergency setting </plain></SENT>
