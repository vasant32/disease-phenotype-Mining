<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of the pericardium meridian (PM) to mitigate or enhance the cardiotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> injected at specific acupoint and non-acupoint sites in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study consisted of 3 experiments that were designed to test the effects of injection of 30 Î¼g/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> at acupoints on the PM (Test 1), at non-acupoint sites on the PM (Test 2), and at acupoints on other meridians and non-meridian sites (Test 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Test 1, 24 rabbits were randomly assigned to receive injections at Quze (PC3), Tianquan (PC2), or intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Test 2, 24 rabbits were randomly assigned to receive injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> at non-acupoint I, non-acupoint II, or intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Test 3, 48 rabbits were randomly assigned to receive injections at Neiguan (PC6), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Yangjiao (GB35), a non-meridian and non-acupoint site (NMNA), intravenously, and intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiographs of the rabbits were performed before, during and after injection to determine the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, latency of ventricular rhythm, and recovery rate after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recovery time index and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 100%, and the latency of ventricular rhythm was less than 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Tests 1 and 2, the recovery rates of the Quze and non-acupoint II groups were significantly higher than those of the muscular group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Test 3, the recovery time index and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores of the Neiguan group were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the other acupoint groups, or the NMNA group, when compared with the group receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> intramuscularly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Acupoints or non-acupoints along the PM could reduce the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> in healthy rabbits </plain></SENT>
