<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each implantation team voluntarily and prospectively recorded data on a data collection form, which was then sent to the Spanish Society of Cardiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 4481 device implantations were notified, representing 83.6% of the estimated total number of implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The notified implantation rate was 97 per million population and the estimated total implantation rate was 116.2 per million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First implantations accounted for 70.2% of the total notified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected from 167 hospitals (22 more than in 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations took place in men (82.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 62.4 (14.1) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients had severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association functional class II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent underlying cardiac condition was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of indications for primary prevention increased over the previous year and accounted for 70.6% of first implantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, 78.4% of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted by cardiac electrophysiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 2011 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry includes data on almost 84% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> implantations of these devices performed in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was the first year in which the number of implants decreased slightly from the previous year, as also occurred in the rest of Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The percentage of implants for primary prevention continued to increase </plain></SENT>
