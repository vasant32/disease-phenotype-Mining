<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The OPERA registry measured the times to, and studied the determinants of, first appropriate (FAT) and inappropriate (FIT) therapies delivered by single-, dual- and triple-chamber [cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D)] <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We entered 636 patients (mean age = 62.0 ± 13.5 years; 88% men) in the registry, of whom 251 received single-, 238 dual-, and 147 triple-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, for primary (30.5%) or secondary (69.5%) indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured times to FAT and FIT as a function of multiple clinical characteristics, examined the effects of various algorithm components on the likelihood of FAT and FIT delivery, and searched for predictors of FAT and FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 22.8 ± 8.8 months of observation, 184 patients (28.9%) received FAT and 70 (11.0%) received FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) was the trigger of 88% of FAT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was the trigger of 91% of FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median times to FIT (90 days; range 49-258) and FAT (171 days; 50-363) were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of FAT was higher (P &lt;0.001) in patients treated for secondary than primary indications, while that of FIT were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 57 analysable FIT, 27 (47.4%) could have been prevented by fine tuning the device programming like the sustained rate duration or the VT discrimination algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: First inappropriate therapy occurred in 11% of 636 ICD recipients followed for ∼2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly 50% of FIT could have been prevented by improving device programming </plain></SENT>
