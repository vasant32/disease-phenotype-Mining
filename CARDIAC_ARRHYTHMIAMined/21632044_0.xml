<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We derive methods for computing the resting state for mathematical models of the electro-chemical process underpinning a heartbeat, and we estimate the stability of the resting state by invoking the largest real part of the eigenvalues of a linearized model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The implementation of the methods is described and a number of numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, we test the methods for problems where we can compare the solutions with analytical results, and problems where we have solutions computed by independent software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The software is also tested for a fairly realistic 3D model </plain></SENT>
