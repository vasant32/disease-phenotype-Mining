<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The majority of individuals with early repolarization (ER) patterns have a benign prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent case-control series and population studies have established a significant association between ER and an increased risk of arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a common agreement that J-waves, particularly of large amplitude, dynamic, and present in multiple leads, are more prevalent in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, but the distinction between benign and malignant electrocardiographic variants of ER is still a controversial subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some authors have proposed the increased dispersion of repolarization or delayed fragmented depolarization in individuals with J-waves would place them at increased arrhythmic risk, but only in the presence of additional proarrhythmic factors or triggers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The scientific community has therefore embraced research for the identification of those proarrhythmic triggers that could unmask the malignant nature of certain ER variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This manuscript aims at reviewing very recently published data relating ER patterns and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in the presence of additional proarrhythmic triggers, in particular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischaemia</z:e>, focusing on possible pathophysiological and electrogenic mechanisms and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
