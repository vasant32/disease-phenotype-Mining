<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We examined circadian periodicity of atrial tachyarrhythmias (AT/AF) in a large group of patients with implantable devices, which allow continuous collection of the event data over prolonged periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 16,130 AT/AF events were recorded in 236 patients (age: 63 ± 12 years, 27% female, 90% had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, 33% ischemic, LVEF: 49 ± 18%) over a period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To exclude interactions with therapy, the patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events and for those episodes that were preceded by at least 1, 6, and 24 hours of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To prevent biasing toward patients with more frequent episodes, the patterns of AT/AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were analyzed both in absolute and patient-normalized (i.e., divided by the total number of events in each patient) units per hour per patient and then summarized for the entire group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with &lt;4 AT/AF events, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> times were randomly distributed over 24-hour period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, as the number of AT/AF events increased, a nocturnal pattern of occurrence (determined by the occurrence of a trough around noon) gradually emerged and became highly statistically significant (P &lt; 10(-4) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of nocturnal peak of AT/AF events was well explained by a single-exponential function (R(2) = 0.97, P &lt; 10(-2) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with more frequent atrial tachyarrhythmias are more likely to develop AT/AF at night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of patient-specific circadian patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence can be useful for personalized management of individuals with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden </plain></SENT>
