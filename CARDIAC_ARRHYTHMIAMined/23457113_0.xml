<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to assess in a large cohort the role of APB during AT in patients with a DAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Thirty-three patients with a DAP having 34 AT were included in the study: 29 patients had an atriofascicular pathway, 1 had a long atrioventricular DAP, and 4 had a short atrioventricular fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APBs were delivered initially from the lateral right atrium, scanning diastole with a 10-ms decrement until AT termination or refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed 4 patterns of response after APB during AT: advancement of activation (29 cases), delay (2), advancement followed by delay (3), and termination (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients required an earlier APB to advance or delay ventricular activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 8 patients had a shorter AT cycle length (median of 273 versus 315 ms; P=0.003) and had a shorter resetting zone (median coupling interval of 30 versus 50 ms; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- APB delivered during AT in patients with a DAP advanced and/or delayed ventricular activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 of 5 of cases the AT was terminated by a single APB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In approximately a quarter of the patients an earlier coupled APB was needed to reset AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high RA was an adequate stimulation site in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> right-sided DAP </plain></SENT>
