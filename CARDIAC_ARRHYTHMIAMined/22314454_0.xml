<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 24 patient, 21(87.5%) had anomalies of origin and distribution and 3(12.5%) had coronary artery fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most coronary anomalies did not result in signs, symptoms or complications and usually were discovered as an incidental finding at the time of catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of them were benign anomalies: i) separate origin of left anterior descending and circumflex from sinus of valsalva; ii) ectopic origin of circumflex from right sinus of valsalva; iii) Anomalous origin of left main coronary artery from right coronary artery; iv) anomalous coronary origin from ascending aorta; v) absent left circumflex; vi) double right coronary artery; vii) small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011641'>coronary artery fistula</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These anomalies may be associated with potentially serious sequelae such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study large <z:hpo ids='HP_0011641'>coronary artery fistula</z:hpo> was found as potentially serious anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">coronary artery anomalies</z:e> require accurate recognition for the appropriate management of the patients </plain></SENT>
