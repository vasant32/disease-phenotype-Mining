<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the association between pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) BB use and in-hospital outcomes in patients who underwent primary PCI for ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> between 2007 and 2009 at institutions participating in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for the nonrandomized use of pre-PCI BBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort comprised 7,667 patients, with 4,769 (62%) receiving pre-PCI BBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were older, with higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In adjusted models, pre-PCI BB use was associated with lower rates of intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, p &lt;0.01) and lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.65, p = 0.022), with increases in rates of emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.56, p &lt;0.01) and repeat PCI (OR 1.93, p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant increases in rates of cardiogenic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pre-PCI BB use in this population was associated with decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and mortality, without increasing rates of cardiogenic shock and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> but with higher rates of repeat PCI and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, suggesting that there may yet remain a role for early BB use in pre-PCI patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
