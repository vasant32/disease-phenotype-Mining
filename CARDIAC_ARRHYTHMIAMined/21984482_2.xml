<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) to induce low-level <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time interval between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> and LPS administration was critical: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> injected 2-12 h before LPS failed to cause this response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in ALT activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> as well as LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> were not affected by LPS coexposure </plain></SENT>
