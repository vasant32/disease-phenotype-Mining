<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> is common in HIV-infected persons; however, the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, AF, has not been adequately studied in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a national sample of 30,533 HIV-infected veterans followed in the Veterans Affairs HIV Clinical Case Registry from 1996-2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the independent associations of demographic characteristics, time-updated comorbidities, and time-updated clinical measurements including CD4+ cell count and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load with the outcome of incident AF using proportional-hazards regression for multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 780 (2.6%) patients developed AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors, a lower CD4+ cell count (&lt;200 compared with &gt;350 cells/mm(3); hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.8; p=0.018) and higher <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load (&gt;100,000 compared with &lt;500 copies/mL; HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; p=0.002) were independently associated with increased risk of incident AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional risk factors independently associated with risk of AF included older age, White race, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, reduced kidney function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a large HIV-infected cohort, markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV disease</z:e> severity represented by low CD4+ cell count and high <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, assessed by multiple time-updated measures, were independently associated with development of AF </plain></SENT>
