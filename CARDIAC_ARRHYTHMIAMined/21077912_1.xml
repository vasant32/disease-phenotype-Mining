<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cryoablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates in pediatrics has been available since 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current approach of pediatric electrophysiologists to the use of cryoablation in the current era </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sent an Internet link to an online survey to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals and not institutions were surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 70 responses were received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responding physicians were largely invasive pediatric electrophysiologists (94%) who practice at mid- to high-volume centers (&gt;50 ablation procedures/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survey responders report that cryoablation was utilized for &lt;50% of the ablation volume, and most utilize it for only 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates, 41% of responders use cryoablation as first-line therapy for atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For accessory pathways, 94% report that cryoablation would only be utilized after mapping the accessory pathway to a "high-risk location." Other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates considered for cryoablation would be accessory pathways mapped to high-risk areas, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011716'>junctional ectopic tachycardia</z:hpo>, a parahisian <z:hpo ids='HP_0011701'>ectopic atrial tachycardia</z:hpo>, or an atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> near the phrenic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For pediatric electrophysiologists who responded to the survey, radiofrequency energy remains the primary energy source for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current use of cryoablation technology is directed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> substrates near the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conduction system or other "high-risk" areas </plain></SENT>
