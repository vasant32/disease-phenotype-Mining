<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a theoretical study of the physiological significance of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), a phenomenon used as an index of cardiac vagal tone and wellbeing, whereby the heart rate (HR) increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first tested the hypothesis that RSA improves gas exchange efficiency but found that although gas exchange efficiency improved with slow and deep breathing and with increased mean heart rate, this was unrelated to RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then formulated and tested a new hypothesis: that RSA minimizes the work done by the heart while maintaining physiological levels of arterial carbon dioxide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the new hypothesis using two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the HR for which the work is minimized was calculated using techniques from optimal control theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This calculation was done on simplified models that we derived from a previously published model of gas exchange in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the calculated HR was remarkably similar to RSA and that this became more profound under slow and deep breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, the HR was prescribed and the work done by the heart was calculated by conducting a series of numerical experiments on the previously published gas exchange model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that cardiac work was minimized for RSA-like HR functions, most profoundly under slow and deep breathing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings provide novel insights into potential reasons for and benefits of RSA under physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
