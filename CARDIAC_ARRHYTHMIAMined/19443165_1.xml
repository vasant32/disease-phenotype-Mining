<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Conducted electrical weapons (CEWs) are used by law enforcement for control of subjects by causing neuromuscular incapacitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There has been scrutiny of CEWs and their potential role in the occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> of subjects in custody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a hypothesized causal relationship due to induced cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous work has not shown dysrhythmia induction in resting humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, these devices are not often used on resting individuals in the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if exposure to a CEW in a physically exhausted human sample population caused detectable change in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human volunteers were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had a baseline ECG obtained and then underwent an exercise regimen until exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The volunteers then received a continuous 15-s application from a TASERÂ® X26 CEW (TASER International, Scottsdale, AZ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CEW electrodes were placed on random positions of their anterior thoraces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electrode positions involved at least a 12-inch spread and always encompassed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anatomic position of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An ECG was obtained immediately after CEW exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ECGs were interpreted by a blinded cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At baseline, 24/25 ECGs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One baseline ECG was abnormal due to several monomorphic premature ventricular complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After CEW exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 25 ECGs were interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged CEW application in an exhausted human sample did not cause a detectable change in their 12-lead ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Theories of CEW-induced dysrhythmia in non-rested humans are not supported by our findings </plain></SENT>
