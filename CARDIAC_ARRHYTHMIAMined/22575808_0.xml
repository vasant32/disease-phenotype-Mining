<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that early repolarization (ER) is associated with increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early repolarization in these studies, however, was defined as J-wave (terminal QRS slurring or notching) or J-point elevation rather than typical ST-segment elevation (STE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and characteristics of these different findings in the general population are poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed prevalence and correlates of STE typical of ER and of J wave in a large population of noncardiac subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively collected electrocardiograms of 4176 consecutive subjects without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early repolarization was found in 84 subjects (2.0%) and J wave in 663 (15.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among ER subjects, a J wave was present in 60 (71.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables independently associated with both ER and J wave included young age, male sex, and lower heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no increased history of symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>) possibly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in STE or J-wave subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Typical ER pattern and J wave are common in noncardiac subjects, particularly in young people, and are not associated with symptoms potentially related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
