<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is increasingly employed to treat this disease, yet the selection of persistent AF patients who will benefit from this treatment remains a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several parameters of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF termination by CA, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, they are usually manually computed and only a subset of electrodes is inspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, a novel perspective of the role of f-wave amplitude as a potential noninvasive predictor of CA outcome is adopted by exploring ECG interlead spatial variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An automatic procedure for atrial amplitude computation based on cubic Hermite interpolation is first proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To describe the global f-wave peak-to-peak amplitude distribution, signal contributions from multiple leads are then combined by condensing the most representative features of the atrial signal in a reduced-rank approximation based on principal component analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that exploiting ECG spatial diversity by means of this <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-based multilead approach does not only increase the robustness to electrode selection, but also substantially improves the predictive power of the amplitude parameter </plain></SENT>
