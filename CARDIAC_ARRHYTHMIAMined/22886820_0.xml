<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the incidence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a series of patients with Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> are important causes of morbidity and mortality in Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>Cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of 19 patients with known Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Device interrogation reports were reviewed for those who had implantable devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram, Holter monitor, and event monitors were reviewed in those who did not have implantable devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of nineteen patients were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine (47%) out of 19 patients had implantable devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implant indications included symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, conduction abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up in the patients with devices was 50 ± 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients received implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) shocks, 1 of which was inappropriate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were paced in the atrium 71% ± 37% of the time and paced in the ventricle 49% ± 52% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients with devices were paced more than 95% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> had lower heart rates prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant than the group that did not have devices (60 ± 10 vs 78 ± 16, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the patients without devices, only 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with implanted devices had higher left ventricular (LV) mass indices compared to patients without implanted devices (136 ± 40 g/m(2) vs 93 ± 19 g/m(2), P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> are uncommon in patients with Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> on ERT, but utilization of pacing is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in Fabry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> may be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
