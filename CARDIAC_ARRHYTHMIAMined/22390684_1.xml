<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case note review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary referral unit (Chelsea and Westminster and Royal Brompton Hospitals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SAMPLE: Twelve pregnancies in nine women with PH between 1995 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multidisciplinary review of case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were two maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1995 and 1998), one related to pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>eclampsia</z:hpo> and one to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal morbidity included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum haemorrhage</z:hpo> (five cases), and one post-caesarean evacuation of a wound haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, nine live births and three first-trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean birthweight was 2197 g, mean gestational age was 34 weeks (range 26-39), and mean birthweight centile was 36 (range 5-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five babies required admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, but were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eventually discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women were delivered by caesarean section (seven elective and two emergency deliveries), under <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anaesthetic</z:chebi> except for one emergency and one elective caesarean performed under regional block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and fetal outcomes for women with PH may be improving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of maternal mortality remains significant, so that early and effective counselling about contraceptive options and pregnancy risks should continue to play a major role in the management of such women when they reach reproductive maturity </plain></SENT>
