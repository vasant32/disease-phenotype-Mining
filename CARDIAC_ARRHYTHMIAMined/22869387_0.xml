<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedure success rate, and the long-term survival of patients who underwent an ablation procedure for OTT or <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a single-center retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 82 consecutive OTT and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPB</z:mp> first ablation procedures between 1999 and 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 46 ± 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three percent of the patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were alive after a median follow-up duration of 31 months (interquartile range, 14-65 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and 12 % had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was documented in 73 % and monomorphic <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPBs</z:mp> in 99 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three percent of the patients were ablated in the right ventricular outflow tract, 15 % in the left ventricular outflow tract, and 12 % in the coronary cusps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency energy was used in 95 % of the patients, cryo energy in 9 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was achieved in 78 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six patients (7 %) experienced a complication (five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusions</z:hpo>, one pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the femoral artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients needed pericardiocentesis (4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablation for OTT and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPB</z:mp> is successful in the vast majority of cases, with a low but still existing complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival was excellent, underscoring the benign nature of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
