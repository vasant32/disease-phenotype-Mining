<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes (ACS) is not standardized and physicians discretion for invasive versus conservative strategies lacks sufficient evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this analysis was, therefore, to evaluate treatment strategies and outcomes of elderly patients with ACS and to highlight reasons for the treatment decision in a consecutive series of elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 1,001 elderly patients (&gt;75 years) presenting with ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified on the basis of their final discharge diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline data, past medical history, cardiac and noncardiac concomitant diseases, treatment strategy, and adverse outcomes were evaluated, using patient's charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various co-variates were used to determine the association or predictive value of these co-variates to the invasive versus conservative management of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality and long-term survival were assessed either directly or in discharged patients via telephone interview with the patients, the patients' relatives or the primary care physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 776 (77.5%) patients were treated invasively and 225 (22.5%) conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with advanced age, Killip class &gt; II, pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, non-ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, prior ACS, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly more likely to undergo conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in conservatively treated patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, we identified age as the main predictor for a conservative treatment strategy in elderly patients, albeit an invasive strategy was associated with a significantly better outcome </plain></SENT>
