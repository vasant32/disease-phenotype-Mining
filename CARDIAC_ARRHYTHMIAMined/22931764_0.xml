<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The concentrations of CS(2) were detected in the representative workshops with different exposure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indicators related to cardiovascular system were tested in 633 workers occupationally exposed to CS(2), which included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, blood routine (blood RT), cholesterol (TCHO), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were analyzed by chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The exposure concentration of CS(2) for 389 workers was less than or equal to 5 mg/m(3), which for other 244 workers was higher than 5 mg/m(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum exposure concentration of CS(2) was 15.73 mg/m(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant effects of CS(2) on the electrocardiogram, red blood cells, white blood cells, blood platelet, TCHO and TG of workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the positive effects of CS(2) on blood pressure and negative effects of CS(2) on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of high TCHO, TG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in male workers were significantly higher than those in female workers (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rates of high TCHO, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in older workers (â‰¤ 30 years old) were significantly higher than those in young workers (&gt; 30 years old) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in workers with 1 - 10 working years was significantly higher than that in workers with more than 10 working years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in workers with 1 - 10 working years was significantly lower than that in workers with more than 10 working years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were no significant effects of CS(2) exposure on the indexes of cardiovascular system of workers </plain></SENT>
