<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of short- and long-term treatment with pegvisomant (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in acromegalic patients resistant to long-term, high-dose therapy with somatostatin analogs (SA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients entered the study. <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients started peg at initial dose of 10MG daily and then titrated to 5MG every 6 weeks on the basis of IGF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard 24-H electrocardiography registration was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at baseline and after 6 AND 18 months of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> to evaluate: mean (HR), maximum (MHR), and minimum (mHR) heart rate; pauses number (P) and duration (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>); supraventricular episodes (SEs) number and duration (SED); and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular ectopic beats</z:mp> (EB) number and duration (EBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular mass (LVM) was also evaluated by standard echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A slight but not significant decrease in HR, MHR, and mHR was observed after 6-month <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>, whereas a significant decrease in HR (P=0.03), MHR (P=0.05), and mHR (P=0.05) was found after 18-month <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LVM significantly (P=0.05) correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRH</z:e> (r=-0.50) after short-term treatment, and with HR (r=-0.54) and mHR (r=-0.55) after long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long-term <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> induced the complete recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> recorded at baseline in one patient and the improvement of rhythm disorders developed after 6-month therapy in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of conduction disturbances passed from 15 to 7.7% after long-term <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi> reduces HR, MHR, and mHR and improves rhythm abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
