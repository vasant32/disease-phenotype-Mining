<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to examine the adverse side effects caused by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> on cardiac rhythm and postural blood pressure changes in elderly patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ECG parameters including heart rate, PR, QT, QTc interval and QRS duration and postural blood pressure changes were recorded at the baseline and at each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> dose level (5 and 10 mg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients Seventy-one consecutive patients who were referred by primary care centers to a Geriatric Clinic were enrolled and underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two subjects completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant changes relative to the baseline in any of the ECG parameters or arterial blood pressure at any of the investigated dosages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53289,53290,53292">donepezil</z:chebi> was not associated with increased negative chronotropic, arrhythmogenic or hypotensive effects for elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
