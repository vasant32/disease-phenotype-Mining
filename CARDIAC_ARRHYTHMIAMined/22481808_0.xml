<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been mechanistically linked to instances of T-wave alternans, a clinically defined ECG alternation in T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cardiac reentry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many alternans detection algorithms have been proposed in the past, but the majority have been designed specifically for use with T-wave alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Action potential duration (APD) signals obtained from experiments (especially those derived from optical mapping) possess unique characteristics, which requires the development and use of a more appropriate alternans detection method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a new class of algorithms, based on the Monte Carlo method, for the detection and quantitative measurement of alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we derive a set of algorithms (one an analytical and more efficient version of the other) and compare its performance with the standard spectral method and the generalized likelihood ratio test algorithm using synthetic APD sequences and optical mapping data obtained from an alternans control experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the benefits of the new algorithm in the presence of Gaussian and Laplacian noise and frame-shift errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proposed algorithms are well suited for experimental applications, and furthermore, have low complexity and are implementable using fixed-point arithmetic, enabling potential use with implantable cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
