<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of our study was to characterize specific tissue reaction of encapsulating lead tissue in patients who underwent transvenous lead removal and evaluate condition of the outer leads' insulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-six leads (27 atrial, 24 ventricular, 5 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) were removed from 31 patients (mean age 70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for removal were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pocket <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (CPI) (9 patients ), infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE) (6), and non-infective indications (NI) (16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leads with their surrounding tissue were fixed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin, and examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outer leads' insulations were examined in stereomicroscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean lead age encapsulated by connective tissue sheath was 89, whereas encapsulated by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> was 47.34 months (P= 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcification was present in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haemosiderine was observed only in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in the pocket (P= 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vasculogenesis was present in one (6%) with NI, five (56%) with CPI, and three (50%) with IE (P= 0.02) and was associated with elevated white blood cells (WBC) (P= 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>Eosinophilia</z:hpo> was associated with elevated WBC (P= 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed are third level of degradation (severe with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>) in the intracardiac part of the <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Insulation damage due to environmental stress cracking concerned <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads with <z:chebi fb="82" ids="53284">polyurethane</z:chebi> overlay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Granulation in encapsulating tissue was present in patients with younger leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Vasculogenesis was observed more often in IE and CPI patients, which might indirectly indicate thickness of the sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eosinophila may indicate allergic component of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Insulation damage frequently concerned the intracardiac part </plain></SENT>
