<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are so many complications that can arise during this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these complications involve the respiratory or cardiovascular systems, especially in sick or sedated patients.The aim of this study was to determine the various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo> that can occur at different stages of diagnostic EGD and to determine their severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is a descriptive one which was carried out at the endoscopy unit of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, (LAUTECH), Osogbo, Osun State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients who were referred for oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) over a 3-month period and who consented to take part in the study were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electrodes of a portable electrocardiographic (ECG) machine (model Cardiovit AT_1ECG Machine) were attached to the patients accordingly and remained fixed till the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG recordings were done at baseline, postpremedication, during intubation and 5 minutes postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the study were analyzed using simple descriptive statistical methods such as range, mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, and numbers and percentages for discreet variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six (26) patients were studied, comprising 14 (53.8%) males and 12 (46.2%) females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 47.19 Â± 14.42 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three (11.5%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> at the beginning of the procedure, while 13 (50%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> postpremedication and during the procedure, whereas 17 (65.4%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various ST-T wave abnormalities were observed at each stage of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conduction abnormality was observed in 8 (30.8%), 9 (34.6%), 7 (26.9%) and 5 (19.2%) patients at rest, post-premedication, during the procedure and postprocedure respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) were observed in 4 (15.4%), 5 (19.2%), 4 (15.4%), and 4 (15.4%) patients at rest, post-premedication, during the procedure and post procedure respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study has shown that, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> do occur during EGD, these abnormalities are not severe enough to warrant specific interventions or discontinuation of the procedure </plain></SENT>
