<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of 1079 patients who underwent intraperitoneal surgery (exclude laparoscope surgery) from July 2007 to June 2008 was reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the patients undergoing intraperitoneal surgery, the incidence of major cardiovascular events was 3.99% (43/1079), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 1.58% (17/1079) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors of major cardiovascular events were age ≥ 60 years, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 ml/(min·1.73 m(2)), emergency surgery and duration of surgery &gt; 2.82 h (OR = 2.68 to 5.19, P = 0.001 to 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cardiac risk of intraperitoneal surgery is 3.99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of cardiac complications should be evaluated in elderly patients and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, more specifically, when emergent or long duration major surgeries are needed </plain></SENT>
