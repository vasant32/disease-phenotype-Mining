<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method, which uses information in correlated signals, is specifically designed to preserve clinically significant aspects of the signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We use template matching to jointly segment the multi-parameter signal, morphological dissimilarity to estimate the quality of the signal segment, similarity search using features on a database of templates to find the closest match, and time-warping to reconstruct the corrupted segment with the matching template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In experiments carried out on the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Database, a two-parameter database with many clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, our method improved the classification accuracy of the beat type by more than 7 times on a signal corrupted with white Gaussian noise, and increased the similarity to the original signal, as measured by the normalized residual distance, by more than 2.5 times </plain></SENT>
