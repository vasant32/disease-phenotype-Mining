<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Clinical consultations with patients should be informed by the evidence-based and involve shared decision making (SDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the delivery of SDM by clinicians with patients referred for invasive treatment of cardiac electrical disease and to establish whether decisions made corresponded with patient and referring physician expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine outpatient consultations with two consultant cardiologists in one large tertiary centre were audio-recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, diagnosis, reasons for referral and decision reached were compared directly with patient and referring physician expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OPTION instrument was used to measure SDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient expectations and satisfaction were elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quality of SDM was good (mean OPTION score 49%) and there was broad patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were suitable for invasive treatment, and the majority (80%, n=39) had been explicitly referred for it, only 59% (n=29) opted to proceed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consultation quality with respect to SDM was significantly greater for patients choosing a less invasive option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These consultations often change expected management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Where decision making in the consultation is of higher quality, patients were more likely to change to a less invasive option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians performing invasive cardiac treatment should be able to demonstrate high quality decision making </plain></SENT>
