<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ethnic differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> incidence have been reported, with a particularly high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in individuals of African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that African ancestry and common genetic variants are associated with prolonged duration of cardiac repolarization, a central pathophysiological determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, as measured by the electrocardiographic QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: First, individual estimates of African and European ancestry were inferred from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in 7 population-based cohorts of African Americans (n=12,097) and regressed on measured QT interval from ECGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, imputation was performed for 2.8 million SNPs, and a genome-wide association study of QT interval was performed in 10 cohorts (n=13,105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of association between genetic ancestry and QT interval (P=0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide significant associations (P&lt;2.5 × 10(-8)) were identified with SNPs at 2 loci, upstream of the genes NOS1AP (rs12143842, P=2 × 10(-15)) and ATP1B1 (rs1320976, P=2 × 10(-10)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most significant SNP in NOS1AP was the same as the strongest SNP previously associated with QT interval in individuals of European ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low probability values (P&lt;10(-5)) were observed for SNPs at several other loci previously identified in genome-wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry, including KCNQ1, KCNH2, LITAF, and PLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed no difference in duration of cardiac repolarization with global genetic indices of African American ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, our genome-wide association study extends the association of polymorphisms at several loci associated with repolarization in individuals of European ancestry to include individuals of African ancestry </plain></SENT>
