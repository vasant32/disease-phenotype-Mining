<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Development of an angioplasty catheter with low crossing profile and small balloon diameter represents an opportunity to facilitate percutaneous revascularization of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and angiographic outcomes were evaluated following a predilation treatment strategy using a low profile, 1.20 mm angioplasty catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point of procedural success was defined as successful device delivery, performance and lesion treatment without occurrence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, flow-limiting dissection, reduction in baseline TIMI grade, or clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and with final achievement of TIMI 3 flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital major adverse events were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 71 patients (83 lesions), angiographic characteristics included: de novo lesion, 75.9%; saphenous vein graft 9.6%; lesion length (mean ± standard deviation), 12.27 ± 5.96 mm; reference vessel diameter, 2.61 ± 0.57 mm; lesion classification B2/C, 59.0%; baseline TIMI 0/1 flow, 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was achieved for 98.5% (66/67) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catheter delivery to the target lesion was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the rate of device success with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> improvement after predilation was 96.2% (75/78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural complications were observed, and in-hospital target lesion failure occurred in 6 patients (8.5%) related to peri-procedural non-Q wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coronary lesion predilation with a low profile, 1.20 mm angioplasty catheter is associated with favorable procedural safety and efficacy and may represent an effective treatment for complex coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
