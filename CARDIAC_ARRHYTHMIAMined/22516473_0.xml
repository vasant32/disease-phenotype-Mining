<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Assessment of the propensity of novel drugs to cause proarrhythmia is essential in the drug development process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is increasingly recognized, however, that QT prolongation alone is an imperfect surrogate marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the behavior of a novel surrogate marker for TdP, the electro-mechanical (E-M) window, prior to triggering of TdP episodes with sympathetic stimulation after administration of a number of reference compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiments were carried out in closed chest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthetized guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Test compounds were administered intravenously together with a specific I(Ks) blocker (JNJ303; 0.2 mgkg(-1)min(-1) for 3 min) and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> (0.06 mgkg(-1)min(-1) for 2 min) was applied to trigger TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ECG, blood- and left ventricular pressure signals were measured continuously throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The E-M window i.e. the duration of the mechanical systole (QLVP(end) interval) minus the duration of the electrical activity (QT interval) was assessed for individual beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Drugs with documented TdP liability (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi>, domperidone, terfenadine, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>) produced TdP in the protocol after <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> infusion, whereas negative control compounds (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, ranolazine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and saline) did not cause TdP <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, even though increases in repolarization times were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TdP were typically preceded by large (greater than -50 ms) negative electro-mechanical windows and were accompanied by aftercontractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The present study in anesthetized guinea pigs indicates that negative E-M windows are a prerequisite for sympathetically-driven TdP induction after the administration of various agents with known proarrhythmic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data are a first step in the validation of this novel protocol; however we believe that this proarrhythmia model in small animals might be a valuable additional tool in the prediction of TdP risk of new chemical entities at the early stages of drug discovery </plain></SENT>
