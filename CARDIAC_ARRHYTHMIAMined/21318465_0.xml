<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> has been long used as a safe sedative and hypnotic drug in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, reports on its cardiovascular adverse effects have been published from time to time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to use Rhesus monkeys as a model to define the dose regiment of chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> at which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be induced and the consequences of the cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Rhesus monkeys of 2-3 years old were intravenously infused with chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> starting at 50 mg/kg with an increasing increment of 25 mg/kg until the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a traditional up-and-down dosing procedure was applied to define a single dose level at which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> can be induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data obtained showed that when the sequentially escaladed dose reached 125 mg/kg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> monkeys tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The single effective dose to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> calculated from the crossover analysis was 143 ± 4 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This value would be equivalent to 68.6 ± 1.9 mg/kg for children and 46.4 ± 1.3 mg/kg for adults in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under either multiple or single dose condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> did not occur before 40 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of anesthesia induced by chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recovered without help at the end of the anesthesia in most cases, but also continued after the regain of consciousness in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were accompanied with compromised cardiac function including suppressed fractional shortening and ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study thus suggests that cautions need to be taken when chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> is used above certain levels and beyond a certain period of anesthesia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> need to be closely monitored because compromised cardiac function may occur simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> should be monitored even after they are recovered from the anesthesia </plain></SENT>
