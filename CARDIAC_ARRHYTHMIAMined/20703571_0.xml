<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper introduces a fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustered probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the discrimination of eight types of ECG beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The performance has been compared with FCM clustered multi layered feed forward network (MLFFN) trained with back propagation algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Important parameters are extracted from each ECG beat and feature reduction has been carried out using FCM clustering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cluster centers form the input of neural network classifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extensive analysis using the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database has shown an average classification accuracy of 97.54% with FCM clustered MLFFN and 99.58% with FCM clustered PNN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fuzzy clustering improves the classification speed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result reveals the capability of the FCM clustered PNN in the computer-aided diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
