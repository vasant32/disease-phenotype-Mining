<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> (SCL) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation is highly variable, depending on the technology used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an increased risk for SCL has been described for a novel, nonirrigated ablation tool using multielectrode phased radiofrequency (PVAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the incidence and long-term follow-up of SCL in patients undergoing robotically assisted pulmonary vein isolation (RA-PVI) as compared with manual PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Circumferential PVI using irrigated radiofrequency current was performed on 70 patients (41 patients with paroxysmal AF, 59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients underwent RA-PVI and 20 patients underwent a manual approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI was performed the day before and the day after the ablation procedure; follow-up MRI was performed on 9 of 12 (75%) patients after a follow-up period of 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SCLs were found in 12 of 70 (17%) patients in this study; the incidence of SCLs was similar in patients undergoing RA-PVI as compared with manually ablated patients (n=9, 18% versus n=3, 15%; probability value=1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient undergoing manual PVI (1%), an SCL with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was detected; the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> completely resolved within 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred in 1 (1%) patient 2 days after manual PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up period of 21 months, no residual SCLs were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SCL using the robotic navigation system was 18% in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence and size of SCL appears to be similar after RA-PVI as compared with manual PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Repeat MRI showed no residual SCLs at long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
