<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies indicate that diagnosis and treatments for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study examined whether CVC prospectively predicted a trajectory of change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three women diagnosed with non-metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> completed the Taylor Manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale, and a 5-min resting electrocardiographic (ECG) segment was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Self-report measures were completed approximately every 3 months for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) significantly predicted the trajectory of change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> over the follow-up period: participants with higher baseline RSA evidenced decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, whereas those with lower baseline RSA had increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CVC facilitates the modulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in women coping with significant stressors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
