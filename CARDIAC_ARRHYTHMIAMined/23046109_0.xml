<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the surgical result of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0005160'>total anomalous pulmonary venous connection</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1997 to March 2011, 12 adult cases of isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp>, with an average age of 24.9 ± 6.7 years (from 18 to 41 years), underwent surgical repair in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered from right-sided volume overload with clinical manifestations varying from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to Darling's classification, eight cases were classified as supracardiac type, four as cardiac type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unobstructed connections were established between the left atrium and the pulmonary common vein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with external cardiac approach in four supracardiac cases, and internal cardiac approach in four cardiac and three supracardiac cases, and Warden technique in one supracardiac patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant operations included De Vega's tricuspid annuloplasty in six patients, patent arteriosus ductus closure in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived the operation, and postoperative follow-up was 100% complete with a period ranging from 10 months to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NYHA grade decreased from 2.33 ± 0.49 to 1.08 ± 0.29 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, among two symptomatic cases; one controlled with medication, another received a successful radiofrequency ablation for incision-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction of isolated adult <z:mp ids='MP_0010441'>TAPVC</z:mp> can be carried out safely with acceptable long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid insufficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> may have a negative long-term impact, which should be evaluated preoperatively and managed individually during surgery </plain></SENT>
