<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to reveal late clinical features of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo> with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) or critical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo> (cPS) after biventricular repair (BVR) based on preoperative right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 1985, 23 of 73 patients with PA/IVS (n=22) or cPS (n=1) with a tripartite RV and without major sinusoidal communication underwent BVR with a hybrid approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean age and weight at BVR were 1.4±2.1 years and 6.9±5.9 kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 10.1±6.4 years (range, 1.1 to 24.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall survival, reintervention-free, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free rates at 20 years were 90.6%, 75.4%, and 50.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients with preoperative RVEDV of 60% to 120% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, echocardiography at 10 years after BVR showed well-maintained RV systolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, RV volume was quantitatively dilated in 16 (88.9%) due to moderate or greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo> in 8 (44.4%), <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> in 12 (66.7%), or both, which caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 3 patients more than 10 years after BVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with preoperative RVEDV of greater than 120% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> required tricuspid valve replacement after BVR, after which refractory atrial tachyarrhythmia developed in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 2 patients with preoperative RVEDV of less than 60% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> showed a cardiac index value within 2.5 L/min/m2 at 1 year after BVR, which did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PA/IVS or cPS and adequately sized RV showed good late clinical features after BVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up examinations are necessary for RV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
