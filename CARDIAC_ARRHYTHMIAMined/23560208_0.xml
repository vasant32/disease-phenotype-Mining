<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has traditionally been known that there is normally a difference in blood pressure (BP) between the two arms; there is at least 20 mm Hg difference in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 10 mm Hg difference in the diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent epidemiologic studies have shown that there are between-arm differences of &lt; 5 mm Hg in simultaneous BP measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study is to examine whether there are between-arm differences in simultaneous BP measurements obtained from ambulatory patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and to identify the factors associated these differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 464 patients who visited the outpatient clinic of Gangneung Asan Hospital clinical department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the current analysis, we excluded patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous BP measurements were obtained using the Omron MX3 BP monitor in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inter-arm difference (IAD) in BP was expressed as the relative difference (right-arm BP [R] minus left-arm BP [L]: R - L) and the absolute difference (|R - L|) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean absolute IAD in SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> were 3.19 ± 2.38 and 2.41 ± 1.59 mm Hg, respectively, in men and 2.61 ± 2.18 and 2.25 ± 2.01 mm Hg, respectively, in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men, there were 83.8% of patients with the IAD in SBP of ≤ 6 mm Hg, 98.1% with the IAD in SBP of ≤ 10 mm Hg, 96.5% with the IAD in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of ≤ 6 mm Hg and 0% with the IAD in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of &gt; 10 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In women, 89.6% of patients had IAD in SBP of ≤ 6 mm Hg, 92.1% with IAD in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of ≤ 6 mm Hg, and 0% with IAD in SBP of &gt; 10 mm Hg or IAD in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of &gt; 10 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gangneung Asan Hospital clinical series of patients showed that the absolute IAD in SBP had a significant correlation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> such as the 10-year Framingham cardiac risk scores and higher BP in men and higher BP in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the absolute IAD in SBP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> had no significant correlation with the age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, drinking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, and renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that there were no significant between-arm differences in simultaneous BP measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that most of the ambulatory patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> had an IAD in SBP of &lt; 10 mm Hg and an IAD in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> of &lt; 6 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
