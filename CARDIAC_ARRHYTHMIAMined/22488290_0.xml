<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the potentially harmful effects of high-intensity exercise on cardiac health and the fine line between physiologic and pathologic adaptation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exercise in the elite athlete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case also highlights the crucial need for regular evaluation of symptoms that suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> in athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) of young athletes is always a tragedy because they epitomize health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, high-intensity exercise sometimes has harmful effects on cardiac health, and pathologic changes, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo>, have been observed in endurance athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, a highly trained 30-year-old cyclist reported brief <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> followed by presyncope feeling while exercising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate investigations revealed nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> originating from the left ventricle on a stress test associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> of the left ventricle as shown with magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite complete cessation of exercise, life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> persisted, leading to complete restriction from competition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differential Diagnosis: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, postmyocarditis, use of drugs and toxic agents, doping, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> could not be treated with catheter ablation procedure or drug suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the athlete was instructed to withdraw completely from sport participation and to have a medical follow-up twice each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uniqueness: To our knowledge, no other report of left ventricle exercise-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> associated with life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in a living young elite athlete exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only postmortem evidence supports such myocardial pathologic adaptation to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To prevent SCD in young athletes, careful attention must be paid to exercise-related symptoms that suggest a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> because they more often are linked to life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
