<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary clinical consequence of AF is an increase in the risk and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment guidelines recommend anticoagulation therapy for most patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One risk-stratification scheme, the CHADS2 index, is simple and widely used to determine the management of patients with AF in regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, new schemes, such as CHA2DS2-VASc, further refine risk stratification to identify patients who would obtain a net clinical benefit from a particular management strategy, thus improving the quality of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with AF for whom oral anticoagulation (OAC) is advisable, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (VKA) therapy is well established and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, OAC with VKAs presents challenges to prescribers and patients in maintaining therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel OACs may offer alternatives to VKAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with nonvalvular AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activated factor X (factor Xa) inhibitor rivaroxaban was recently approved by the FDA both for prophylaxis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, which may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in patients undergoing knee or hip arthroplasty, and for reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> in patients with nonvalvular AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apixaban, another factor Xa inhibitor, was recently shown to be effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This article reviews clinical considerations regarding new agents that may offer alternatives to VKA therapy for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
