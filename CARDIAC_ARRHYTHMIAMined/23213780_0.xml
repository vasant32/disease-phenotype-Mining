<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SD rats were randomly divided into one control group, one sham operation group and five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> groups which received ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The five experiment groups divided into 15min, 30min, 1 h, 3 h and 6h after LAD ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of HIF-1alpha was detected by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the control group and sham operation group showed no expression of HIF-1alpha, whereas the expression of HIF-1alpha could be weakly detected beneath the endocardium at 15 min after LAD ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> process, the positive staining gradually extended from endocardium to epicardium, reached the peak at 3 h, and began to decrease gradually at 6h after LAD ligation but still maintained at a relatively high level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of HIF-1alpha without a time-dependent way was also detected in full thickness of the right ventricle in occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> after LAD ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha may be regarded as a sensitive marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> induced by early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, and may also be helpful for the diagnosis of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
