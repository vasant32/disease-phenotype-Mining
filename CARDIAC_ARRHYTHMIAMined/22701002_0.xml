<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Definitive diagnosis requires compatible clinical and imaging features as well as pathogenic identification of non-caseating granulomas in at least one organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease has a wide variety of clinical and radiological manifestations but is associated with low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, cardiac involvement which is clinically only identified in 5% significantly worsens prognosis due to complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> or conduction disturbance leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement is implicated in 77-85% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> directly related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy series in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> patients show cardiac involvement with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> in up to 79% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case details the clinical course of a 56-year-old female who had experienced refractory cardiac dysrhythmias for many years in the context of also having biopsy proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had failed multiple antiarrhythmics as well as pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was not until she presented as a potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> that the possibility of cardiac involvement from her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> was entertained as the aetiology of her cardiac problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Confirmation of myocardial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> with PET CT imaging and subsequent treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> resulted in her clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
