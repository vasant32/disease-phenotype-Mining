<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no guidelines concerning athletes who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during an exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether they should be allowed to continue with their competitive activity or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term follow-up of athletes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during an exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes, less than 35 years old, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during an exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety athletes had &gt; or = 3 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> (group A) and 102 athletes had ventricular couplets or non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> during an exercise test (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A control group of 92 athletes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was randomly selected from the database (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> athletes, except one who died from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, were alive during a follow-up period of 70 +/- 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0003116'>abnormal echocardiogram</z:hpo> was obtained in seven athletes from group A (10%), four from group B (5%), and one from group C (3%) (not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0003116'>abnormal echocardiogram</z:hpo> was more likely to be present in competitive athletes (P = 0.001) and in female athletes (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during exercise are more commonly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in young competitive athletes and in female athletes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When present, they necessitate a thorough investigation and follow-up </plain></SENT>
