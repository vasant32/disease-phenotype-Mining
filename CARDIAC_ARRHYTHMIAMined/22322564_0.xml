<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with palliated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (TOF) often require pulmonary valve replacement in adulthood, yet the data regarding their outcomes are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with postoperative complications in these patients and to establish long-term survival data for this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective cohort study investigated 153 consecutive patients with a history of TOF repair who underwent pulmonary valve replacement at a single large academic center between March 1996 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In part 1 of the study, logistic models were constructed to assess demographic, medical, and surgical risk factors for operative mortality; occurrence of a major adverse event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, reoperation, or operative mortality); and prolonged hospital stay (&gt;7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors with a p value less than 0.10 by univariate analysis were included in the subsequent multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In part 2 of the study, long-term, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was determined by construction of a Kaplan-Meier curve for the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died (4.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors for mortality in the multivariable analysis included age older than 40 years (odds ratio (OR) 9.89) and concomitant surgery (OR 6.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A major adverse event occurred for 22 patients (14.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only significant risk factor in the multivariable analysis for an adverse event was concomitant surgery (OR 6.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hospital stay was longer than 7 days for 31 patients (20.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The significant risk factors for a prolonged hospital stay included the presence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (OR 4.17), New York Heart Association class 3 (OR 4.35), and again, concomitant surgery (OR 4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the 146 hospital survivors, only 5 patients died in the intervening period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The predicted survival rates were 98.5% at 1 year, 96.7% at 5 years, and 93.5% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary valve replacement in adults with palliated TOF is a safe procedure with excellent long-term survival, but there remain important risk factors for postoperative mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and major adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Awareness and modification of important risk factors may help to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
