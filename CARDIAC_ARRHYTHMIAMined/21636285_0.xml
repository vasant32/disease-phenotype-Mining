<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Oxygen is routinely administered to patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> as well as during revascularization procedures and cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because reactive oxygen species are mediators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury, increased oxygen availability might theoretically aggravate myocardial injury during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that ventilation with a hyperoxic gas at start of reperfusion might increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and ventilated with 40% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were subjected to 40 min of regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> and 120 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the test group, rats (n=11) were ventilated with a normobaric hyperoxic gas (95% O2) during the last 10 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the first 10 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control rats (n=14) were ventilated with 40% O2 throughout the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to irreversible reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, one animal in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> group and six animals in the control group were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hearts (n=8 in the control group and n=10 in the test group) were harvested for measurement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was 1/11 in the test group and 6/14 in the control group (p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion with normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> did not influence <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (20±8% of area at risk) compared with the normoxia group (24��8% and of area at risk), respectively (mean±SD, p&gt;0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Normobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> during early reperfusion did not increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
