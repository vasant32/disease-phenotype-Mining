<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Catheter ablation of typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFl) is succesful if double electrograms on the ablation line are widely separated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a small interval may also be compatible with complete isthmus block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predicting such a situation may avoid useless additionnal radiofrequency (RF) applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We postulated that measuring the extra-isthmus activation time (EIAT) on the counterclockwise (CCW) flutter wave is correlated with the extra-isthmus conduction time after a proven block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Files of 76 patients (71 males, 71 ± 12 years) ablated for typical CCW AFl were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten had 2/1 conduction prohibiting reliable measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients with proven crista terminalis shunt were also excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 63 patients, EIAT was measured on the surface ECG before the first RF pulse from the beginning of the negative deflection of the F wave in lead III to the end of the positive deflection (or beginning of the plateau) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After successful ablation and completion of block, right atrial (RA) CCW (during low septal pacing), and clockwise (CW) (during low lateral pacing) activation times were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flutter cycle length was 247 ± 34 ms and EIAT was 142 ± 25 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A bidirectionnal isthmus block was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after an RF delivery time of 623 ± 546 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At a pacing cycle length of 681 �� 71 ms, RA CCW and CW activation times were 147 ± 23 and 139 ± 26 ms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between EIA, RA CCW (r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.0001), and CW (r = 0.69, p = 0.0002) activation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EIAT on the flutter wave is an easy and feasible measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is correlated with extra-isthmus RA conduction time after block completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>EIAT can be used as a measure to predict the post cavo-tricuspid isthmus block RA activation time </plain></SENT>
