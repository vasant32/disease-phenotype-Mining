<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or (clinically silent) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> during and after marathon running are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/ DESIGN: In the prospective observational "Berlin Beat of Running" study experienced endurance athletes underwent clinical examination (CE), 3 Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), carotid ultrasound imaging (CUI) and serial blood sampling (BS) within 2-3 days prior (CE, MRI, CUI, BS), directly after (CE, BS) and within 2 days after (CE, MRI, BS) the 38th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants wore a portable electrocardiogram (ECG)-recorder throughout the 4 to 5 days baseline study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with pathological MRI findings after the marathon, troponin elevations or detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> will be asked to undergo cardiac MRI to rule out structural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A follow-up is scheduled after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we report the baseline data of the enrolled 110 athletes aged 36-61 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 48.8 ± 6.0 years, 24.5% were female, 8.2% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 2.7% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Participants have attended a mean of 7.5 ± 6.6 marathon races within the last 5 years and a mean of 16 ± 36 marathon races in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their weekly running distance prior to the 38th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON was 65 ± 17 km </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, 108 (98.2%) Berlin Beat-Study participants successfully completed the 38th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Findings from the "Berlin Beats of Running" study will help to balance the benefits and risks of extensive endurance sport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ECG-recording during the marathon might contribute to identify athletes at risk for cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MRI results will give new insights into the link between physical stress and brain damage </plain></SENT>
