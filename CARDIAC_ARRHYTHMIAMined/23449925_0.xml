<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracardiac mapping has recently shown that paroxysmal and persistent AF is sustained by rotors or focal sources that are stable in location and thus targets for limited ablation [focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM)] to eliminate AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the numbers and locations of concurrent sources determine both the complexity of AF and the approach for ablation.METHODS AND RESULTS: In 36 AF patients (n = 29 persistent, 63 ± 9 years) in the CONventional ablation with or without Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation (CONFIRM) trial, we developed phase lock (PL) to quantify spatial repeatability of ECG 'F-waves' between leads over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase lock spectrally quantifies the angle θ between F-wave voltages in planes formed by ECG leads I, aVF, and V1 at successive points in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared PL with ECG spectral dominant frequency (DF) and organizational index (OI) to characterize stable rotors and focal sources validated by intracardiac FIRM mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focal impulse and rotor modulation ablation alone at ≤3 sources acutely terminated and rendered AF non-inducible or substantially slowed AF in 31 of 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristics of PL for this endpoint had area under the curve (AUC) = 0.72, and the optimum cut-point (PL = 0.09) had 74% sensitivity, 92% positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristics areas for OI and DF were 0.50 and 0.58, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left (n = 28) or right (n = 3) atrial sources were localized by PL with AUC = 0.85, sensitivity 100%, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> 30%, and negative predictive value 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spectral DF provided AUC = 0.79 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Notably, PL did not comigrate with diagnosis of paroxysmal or persistent AF (P = NS), unlike ECG DF.CONCLUSION: The novel metric of ECG PL identifies patients with fewer (≤3) or greater numbers of stable rotors/focal sources for AF, validated by intracardiac FIRM mapping, and localized them to right or left atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data open the possibility of using 12-lead ECG analyses to classify AF mechanistically and plan procedures for right- or left-sided FIRM ablation </plain></SENT>
