<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study at a university teaching hospital in Turin, northern Italy, recruiting subjects aged &gt;65 years consecutively attending the medical ED during 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demography, functional and cognitive status, comorbidity, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e>, previous ED accesses and hospitalization, diagnosis and other relevant data for ED admission and hospitalization were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were collected for 1632 patients (average age 77.6 years), 89% of the 1834 older subjects who attended the ED during the study period (29.3% of the patients attending the ED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six hundred and fifty older subjects were admitted to the hospital (62.2% of the hospital admissions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critical illness</z:e>, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, a high number of drugs being taken, functional dependence and advanced age were independently associated with hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-third of the patients appeared to be frequent users of health services with more than two visits/admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher comorbidity, partial or complete functional dependence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, diseases of the large intestine) and politherapy were associated either with frequent use of the ED and multiple admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elderly account for a high proportion of hospitalizations, mainly determined by critical health conditions, advanced age and functional dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Poor health conditions (high comorbidity and presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> multi-organ diseases), functional dependence but not critical social factors were the main determinants of multiple hospital admissions </plain></SENT>
