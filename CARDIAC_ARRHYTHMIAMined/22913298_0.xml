<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been recently reported in Psychophysiology that carriers of the short allele of an insertion/deletion (ins/del) functional polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR) of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter gene may display decreased resting respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this region hosts another functionally connected single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs25531), which should also be genotyped in order to correctly categorize the low- and high-expressing alleles of 5-HTTLPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated resting RSA in an ethnically homogenous sample (N = 143) of participants genotyped for both the ins/del and rs25531 polymorphisms in 5-HTTLPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the biallelic genotypes, based only on the ins/del alleles, the triallelic 5-HTTLPR genotypes (i.e., including rs25531) showed no association with resting RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Taking a triallelic approach to 5-HTTLPR is thus necessary in order to avoid false positive results </plain></SENT>
