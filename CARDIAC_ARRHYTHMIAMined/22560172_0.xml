<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive study, we examined 347 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded major events including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, nonfatal major events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, symptomatic or sustained ventricular or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>), and minor events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, nonsustained supraventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 347 patients, 65 (19%) had mild, 145 (42%) had moderate, and 137 (40%) had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> by echocardiographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No major events occurred during the tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minor events occurred in a total of 97 patients (28%), including 10 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>; and one who had asymptomatic nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiology-referred patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> with preserved systolic function appears to be associated with very low risk of major adverse cardiovascular events during testing </plain></SENT>
