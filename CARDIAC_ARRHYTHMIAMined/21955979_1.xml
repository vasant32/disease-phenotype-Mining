<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complications are one of the most common and the most serious extraskeletal manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor, is widely used in the treatment of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion (QTd), which relates to left ventricular function and is used as an index of cardiac dysrhythmia, may be useful as a prognostic guide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early detection of possible cardiac involvement may not be clinically evident, whereas it may be detected by electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective study was to assess the effect of infliximab treatment on QT intervals in patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients (17 females and 4 males) with AS who were in the active phase of disease (Bath <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ankylosing Spondylitis</z:e> Disease Activity Index score &gt;4) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was administered intravenously at a dosage of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and every 6 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QT intervals were recorded before and after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QT corrected (QTc) for heart rate was significantly reduced in the patients with AS after 6 months of infliximab therapy (406 ± 5.5 vs 388 ± 6.6 milliseconds; P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the QTc dispersion (34.3 ± 11.1 vs 34.1 ± 8.6; P = 0.171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body mass index and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile were slightly increased after the treatment, but the difference was statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>Inflammation</z:mp> can affect the ventricles with an unknown mechanism, and QTc may be slightly prolonged as a result in the active phase of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our study, QTc was shortened under infliximab therapy by suppressing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this effect may protect patients with AS from fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
