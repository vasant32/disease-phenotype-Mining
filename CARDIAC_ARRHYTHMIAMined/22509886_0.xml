<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, because of the lack of tactile feedback and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the robotic sheath, this approach could result in higher risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This worldwide survey reports a multicenter experience on the methodology, efficacy, and safety of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hansen</z:e> system in AF ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A questionnaire addressing questions on patient's demographics, procedural parameters, ablation success rate and safety information was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> centers where more than 50 robotic AF ablation cases have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From June 2007 to December 2009, 1,728 procedures were performed at 12 centers utilizing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hansen</z:e> robotic navigation technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 4.7% and the success rate was 67.1% after 18 Â± 4 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 low volume centers there appeared to be a learning curve of about 50 cases (complication rate 11.2% for the first 50 cases vs 3.7% for the 51-100 cases; P = 0.044) and a trend showing a decrease of complication rate with increasing case volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the remaining 7 centers no learning curve was present and the complication rate was stable over time (3.7% for the first 50 cases vs 3.6% for the 51st case thereafter; P = 0.942) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hansen</z:e> robotic system can be used for AF ablation safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In low volume centers, there appeared to be a learning curve of the first 50 cases after which the complication rate decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a higher case volume, the success rate increased </plain></SENT>
