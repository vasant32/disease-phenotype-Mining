<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Complete resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> remains the standard of care for selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An open approach causes criticism because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Without manual palpation the video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure has the high probability of missing occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transxiphoid bilateral lung metastasectomy surgery has not been widely adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We developed a hand-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for bilateral lung metastasectomy through natural sternocostal triangle access in 2001 to solve the problems mentioned previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 55 consecutive patients between 2001 and 2009 who underwent hand-assisted thoracoscopic surgery through sternocostal triangle access for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications after operation, operative time, operative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, air leak days, length of stay, preoperation imaging examination, and survival rate were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bilateral explorations were performed in a total of 51 patients, with a total of 201 minimal resections and one lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nearly half of the patients with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were misdiagnosed as unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> by imaging examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> was experienced in 5.2% of the right and 10.5% of the left approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complication rate was 3.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three-year and five-year overall survival rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were 59.8% and 47.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new surgical procedure, with an assisted hand, could complete bilateral pleural exploration in a single operation through the natural sternocostal triangle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is easy to perform and may help the patients gain a faster rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it may lead to a better survival </plain></SENT>
