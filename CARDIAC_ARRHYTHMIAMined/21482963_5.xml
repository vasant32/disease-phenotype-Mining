<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reverse rate dependence (RRD) of actions of I(Kr)-blocking drugs to increase the action potential duration (APD) and beat-to-beat variability of repolarization (BVR) of APD is proarrhythmic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether inhibition of endogenous, physiological late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current (late I(Na)) attenuates the RRD and proarrhythmic effect of I(Kr) inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Duration of the monophasic APD (MAPD) was measured from female rabbit hearts paced at cycle lengths from 400 to 2000 milliseconds, and BVR was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a drug, duration of monophasic action potential at 90% completion of repolarization (MAPD(90)) and BVR increased as the cycle length was increased from 400 to 2000 milliseconds (n=36 and 26; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both E-4031 (20 nmol/L) and d-sotalol (10 μmol/L) increased MAPD(90) and BVR at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimulation rates, and the increase was greater at slower than at faster pacing rates (n=19, 11, 12 and 7, respectively; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="9506">Tetrodotoxin</z:chebi> (1 μmol/L) and ranolazine significantly attenuated the RRD of MAPD(90,) reduced BVR (P&lt;0.01), and abolished <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> in hearts treated with either 20 nmol/L E-4031 or 10 μmol/L d-sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endogenous late I(Na) in cardiomyocytes stimulated at cycle lengths from 500 to 4000 milliseconds was greater at slower than at faster stimulation rates, and rapidly decreased during the first several beats at faster but not at slower rates (n=8; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a computational model, simulated RRD of APD caused by E-4031 and d-sotalol was attenuated when late I(Na) was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endogenous late I(Na) contributes to the RRD of I(Kr) inhibitor-induced increases in APD and BVR and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
