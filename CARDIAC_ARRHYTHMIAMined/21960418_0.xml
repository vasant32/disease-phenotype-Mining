<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk of patients ineligible for the TWA test is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective observational study of patients with LV ejection fraction ≤40% due to ischemic or non-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, designed to evaluate the prognostic value of TWA for lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, sustained rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), and appropriate defibrillator therapy for rapid VT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 453 patients enrolled in the study, 280 (62%) were eligible for the TWA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TWA was negative in 82 patients (29%), who accounted for 18% of the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median of follow-up was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year event-free rate for the primary end point was significantly higher in TWA-negative patients (97.0%) than in TWA non-negative patients (89.5%, P = 0.037) and those ineligible for the TWA test (84.4%, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis identified both non-negative TWA [hazard ratio (HR) 4.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-19.2; P = 0.047) and ineligibility for the TWA test (HR 6.89; 95% CI 1.59-29.9; P = 0.010) to be independent predictors of the primary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TWA showed high negative predictive ability for lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in patients with LV dysfunction, although the TWA-negative patients accounted for only 18% of the entire population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those ineligible for the TWA test had the highest risk for lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
