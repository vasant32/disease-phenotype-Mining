<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AREAS COVERED: Ranolazine is an agent currently used for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, which inhibits transmembrane ionic currents involved in several phases of the action potential in both the atrial and the ventricular cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to its mechanism of action, ranolazine has been shown to exhibit antiarrhythmic properties that have been validated in the experimental models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article recapitulates the mechanism of antiarrhythmic action of ranolazine, the existing clinical data, and the ongoing relevant clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERT OPINION: The combination of the antiischemic properties of ranolazine with its antiarrhythmic potency and minimal proarrhythmia provides a promising background that could expand its therapeutic role in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and ventricular tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data derived from adequately powered randomized clinical trials will determine whether the door to a new indication will open for ranolazine in the near future </plain></SENT>
