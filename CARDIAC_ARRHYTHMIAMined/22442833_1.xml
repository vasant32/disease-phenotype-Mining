<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine cases with this condition were examined from our histopathology records comprising 6 women and 3 men with an age range of 26 to 47 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were sudden, and only one patient complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> and she was 8 weeks postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed dissection macroscopically, though 4 of the 6 cases, which were sent for a second opinion, were described as having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> coronaries by the referring pathologists </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were examined histologically and confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection of the coronary arteries, with more than 2 arteries affected in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
