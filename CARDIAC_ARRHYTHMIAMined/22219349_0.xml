<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although incident cardiac complications occur in patients with community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, their incidence, timing, risk factors, and associations with short-term mortality are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1343 inpatients and 944 outpatients with community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were followed up prospectively for 30 days after presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incident cardiac complications (new or worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, new or worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>) were diagnosed in 358 inpatients (26.7%) and 20 outpatients (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although most events (89.1% in inpatients, 75% in outpatients) were diagnosed within the first week, more than half of them were recognized in the first 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with their diagnosis included older age (odds ratio [OR]=1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.04), nursing home residence (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.0-6.3), prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7), previously diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.04-2.0), arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1), respiratory rate ≥30 breaths per minute (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), blood pH &lt;7.35 (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.8-5.7), blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen ≥30 mg/dL (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2), serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> &lt;130 mmol/L (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.02-3.1), hematocrit &lt;30% (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> on presenting chest x-ray (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), and inpatient care (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.8-8.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incident cardiac complications were associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days after adjustment for baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>Pneumonia</z:hpo> Severity Index score (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.04-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incident cardiac complications are common in patients with community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and are associated with increased short-term mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age, nursing home residence, preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> severity are associated with their occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to test risk stratification and prevention and treatment strategies for cardiac complications in this population </plain></SENT>
