<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 61 consecutive CS patients who were admitted to our hospital from April 2002 to March 2012 with a mean follow-up period of 45 Â± 31 months for the relationship between delayed enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) and VA or a composite endpoint, including VA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalization, and cardiovascular mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics between patients with VA and those without it, the former group was characterized as compared with the latter by lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (p&lt;0.05), larger LV systolic/diastolic dimensions (both p&lt;0.05), and a significant association with DE-MRI (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patients with DE-MRI (n=26), as compared with those without it (n=11), had a significantly higher composite endpoint event rate (41% vs. 0%, p&lt;0.05) and a trend toward higher VA (29% vs. 0%, p=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis also showed that impaired LV systolic function was significantly associated with composite events on follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the presence of DE-MRI is a significant predictor of VA events and poor outcome in CS patients </plain></SENT>
