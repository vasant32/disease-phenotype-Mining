<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morbidity score was calculated by adding the scores of observed complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the sum amounted to more than 5 points, a morbidity score of only 5 points was attributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If no complication was detected, a score of 0.5 points was assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting morbidity scores were correlated with the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in the hospital, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and Aristotle complexity scores.Results A total of 542 primary procedures performed in the year 2011 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aristotle basic and comprehensive scores amounted to 7.78 ± 2.65 and 10.15 ± 3.83, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 1.85% (10/542) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardized ratio of surgical performance reached 103.10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total cavopulmonary connection with extracardiac fenestrated conduit constituted the most frequent operation (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complication was observed following 183 (33.8%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than two complications were observed in 114 cases (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The three most frequent unfavorable conditions were "mechanical ventilation 25 to 95 hours" (n = 150), low cardiac output syndrome (n = 56), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> requiring medication (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The estimated mean morbidity score amounted to 2.26 ± 1.80 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Scores ranged from 0.68 ± 0.50 for primary closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> to 4.50 ± 0.79 for the Norwood procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They were perfectly related to the length of ICU stay and to the duration of mechanical ventilation (Spearman coefficient r = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Correlation was high with the length of hospital stay (r = 0.83), Aristotle basic score (r = 0.89) (C-index = 0.96), and comprehensive score (r= 0.94) (C-index= 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The observed mean morbidity score was statistically not different from the expected mean morbidity score according to the basic Aristotle complexity: p = 0.73.Conclusion Quantification of morbidity indicates the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation as the best surrogates for morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Such benchmarking and scoring of observed postoperative complications paves the way for an accurate assessment and improvement of quality care in congenital heart surgery </plain></SENT>
