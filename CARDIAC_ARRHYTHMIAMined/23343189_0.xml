<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (AA) is the most common complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only beta-blockers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> have been convincingly shown to decrease its incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> on this complication is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> as a sole or adjuvant agent in addition to beta-blocker on suppressing postoperative AA after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane library databases and online clinical trial database up to May 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used random effects model when there was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between trials and fixed effects model when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials were identified, enrolling a total of 1251 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and beta-blocker did not significantly decrease the incidence of postoperative AA after CABG versus beta-blocker alone (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.47, P = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">Magnesium</z:chebi> in addition to beta-blocker did not significantly affect LOS (weighted mean difference -0.14â€‰days of stay, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.29, P = 0.24) or the overall mortality (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08-4.56, P = 0.62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However the risk of postoperative adverse events was higher in the combination of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> and beta-blocker group than beta-blocker alone (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.66-4.71, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis offers the more definitive evidence against the prophylactic administration of intravenous <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> for prevention of AA after CABG when beta-blockers are routinely administered, and shows an association with more adverse events in those people who received <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
