<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 1998 to May 2009, 975 patients (830 male, 145 female) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were screened retrospectively for failed PHD and analysed for its consequences, risk factors, and patient characteristics after successful intra-operative testing in the implantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-hospital discharge testing procedure was performed in 809 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse events (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, persistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of failed PHD was 1.4% (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms were defibrillation threshold failure in 9/11 cases and sensing failure in 2/11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study predictors for PHD-failure are: (i) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> other than ischaemic or dilative, (ii) young age, and (iii) small or very large left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( &lt; 40 or &gt; 65 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particularly, (i) manufacture of device or leads, (ii) lead design, (iii) medical treatment, or (iv) gender have no significant influence on PHD failure </plain></SENT>
