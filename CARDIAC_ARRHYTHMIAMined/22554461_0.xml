<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is minimal literature on the clinical and electrocardiographic characteristics of RVI VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with RVI VT who underwent electrophysiology study between 2006 and 2011 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (including arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy patients underwent an electrophysiology study for VT arising from the right ventricle during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (13%) met the inclusion criteria for RVI VT and were the subject of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 46 years (range, 14-71), and VT cycle length was 295 milliseconds (range, 279-400 milliseconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> VTs had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inferiorly directed QRS axis was noted in 7 (78%) of 9 patients and a left superior axis in 2 (22%) of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A QS or rS pattern was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in aVR and V(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A transition from S to R wave occurred in V(3) to V(5) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with 78% of the patients transitioning in V(4) or V(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation was attempted in 8 (89%) of 9 patients and was successful in 6 (67%) of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ablation was limited in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unsuccessful patients due to the proximity to the His and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic findings of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QRS axis, QS or rS patterns in aVR and V(1), and late S to R transition (V(4)/V(5)) are commonly found in RVI VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of the proximity to the His, ablation of RVI VT may be more challenging than that of right ventricular outflow tract VT </plain></SENT>
