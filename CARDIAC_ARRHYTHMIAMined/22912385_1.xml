<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are increasingly being used for cardiovascular research, including disease modeling, and hold promise for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current cardiac differentiation protocols exhibit variable success across different PSC lines and are primarily based on the application of growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, extracellular matrix is also fundamentally involved in cardiac development from the earliest morphogenetic events, such as gastrulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a more effective protocol for cardiac differentiation of human PSCs by using extracellular matrix in combination with growth factors known to promote cardiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: PSCs were cultured as monolayers on Matrigel, an extracellular matrix preparation, and subsequently overlayed with Matrigel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The matrix sandwich promoted an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as in gastrulation with the generation of N-cadherin-positive mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combining the matrix sandwich with sequential application of growth factors (Activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4, and basic fibroblast growth factor) generated CMs with high purity (up to 98%) and yield (up to 11 CMs/input PSC) from multiple PSC lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting CMs progressively matured over 30 days in culture based on myofilament expression pattern and mitotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Action potentials typical of embryonic nodal, atrial, and ventricular CMs were observed, and monolayers of electrically coupled CMs modeled cardiac tissue and basic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic extracellular matrix application promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human PSCs and complemented growth factor signaling to enable robust cardiac differentiation </plain></SENT>
