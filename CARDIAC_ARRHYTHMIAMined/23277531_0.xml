<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the results of a femoral approach with a Needle's Eye Snare and Femoral Workstation as a primary tool for extracting pacing leads.PATIENTS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-six pacing leads implanted for &gt;6 months were extracted in 229 consecutive patients (178 male, age 70.4 ± 12.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, traction was performed with a standard stylet, and if unsuccessful this was followed by the femoral approach with a Needle's Eye Snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Traction sufficed for 136 leads and a femoral approach was required in 340 leads, their respective implant times were 3.7 ± 2.9 and 9.2 ± 5.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Needle's Eye Snare failed or was only partial successful (leaving a lead remnant of &lt;4 cm) in, respectively, 1.8 and 3.8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leads, 2.7 and 7.1% of 182 right ventricular, 0.7 and 0% of 144 atrial leads, and in none of 14 coronary sinus leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> leads implanted for &lt;10 years were removed with a clinical success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were successfully operated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>.CONCLUSION: Needle's Eye Snare lead extraction has a low complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique should be considered as a primary tool for extraction of pacing leads, particularly atrial and coronary sinus pacing leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results for extracting ventricular leads might be improved if larger bore sheaths with a better cutting edge were available </plain></SENT>
