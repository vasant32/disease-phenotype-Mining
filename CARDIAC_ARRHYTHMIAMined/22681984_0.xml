<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: In a healthy heart, the mechanoelectric feedback (MEF) process acts as an intrinsic regulatory mechanism of the myocardium which allows the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac contraction by damping mechanical perturbations in order to generate a new healthy electromechanical situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, under certain conditions, the MEF can be a generator of dramatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> by inducing local electrical depolarizations as a result of abnormal cardiac tissue deformations, via stretch-activated channels (SACs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, these perturbations can propagate in the whole heart and lead to global cardiac dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we qualitatively investigate the influence of temperature on autonomous electrical activity generated by the MEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We introduce a one-dimensional time-dependent model containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the key ingredients that allow accounting for the excitation-contraction coupling, the MEF and the thermoelectric coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our simulations show that an autonomous electrical activity can be induced by cardiac deformations, but only inside a certain temperature interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, in some cases, the autonomous electrical activity takes place in a periodic way like a pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also highlight that some properties of action potentials, generated by the mechanoelectric feedback, are significantly influenced by temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the situation where a pacemaker activity occurs, we also show that the period is heavily temperature-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our qualitative model shows that the temperature is a significant factor with regards to the electromechanical behavior of the heart and more specifically, with regards to the autonomous electrical activity induced by the cardiac tissue deformations </plain></SENT>
