<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial; no placebo CPAP used </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALLOCATION: Randomization was performed using a computer generated list of random numbers in the coordinating center and results were mailed to participating centers in numbered opaque envelopes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BLINDING: Primary outcome was evaluated by individuals not involved in the study and who were blinded to patient allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients, investigators, and the statistician were not blinded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 725 adults (mean age 51.8 y, 14% women) who were diagnosed with OSA with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) ≥ 20 events per hour and Epworth sleepiness score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESS</z:e>) ≤ 10 were randomized </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received dietary counseling and advice about sleep hygiene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was the incidence of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> (among participants who were normotensive at baseline) or CV events (among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The sample size was calculated assuming that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or new CV event in this population over a period of 3 years would be 10% annually; 345 patients per group were needed to detect a 60% reduction in incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or CV events (90% power, 2-sided α = 0.05, assuming 10% study dropout) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PATIENT FOLLOW-UP: 83% complete (only patients who received the allocated intervention were included in analysis of primary outcome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: A total of 147 patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 59 cardiovascular events were identified (Table) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the CPAP group, there were 68 patients with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and 28 CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Of the 357 participants in the CPAP group, 127 used CPAP &lt; 4 hours/night (36%) </plain></SENT>
