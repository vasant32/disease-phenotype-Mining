<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The lack of readily available branched and fenestrated endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (EVAR) options has created an opportunity for creative deployment of endograft components to treat juxtarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our early experience with "snorkel" or "chimney" techniques in the endovascular management of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed planned snorkel procedures for juxtarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> performed from September 2009 to August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our standardized technique included axillary or brachial cutdown for delivery of covered snorkel stents and mostly percutaneous femoral access for the main body endograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six snorkel grafts were successfully placed in 28 consecutive patients (mean age, 75 years) with juxtarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size was 64.8 mm (range, 53-87 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The snorkel configuration extended the proximal seal zone from an unsuitable infrarenal neck for standard EVAR (median diameter, 33.5 mm; length, 0.0 mm) to a median neck diameter of 24.5 mm and length of 18.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had unilateral renal snorkels, 17 had bilateral renal snorkels, and six had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e>/superior mesenteric artery/renal combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical success of snorkel placements was 98.2%, with loss of wire access leading to one renal stent deployment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was 7.1%: one patient was readmitted 1 week postoperatively with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>; one patient died at 1 week of a right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other major complications included perinephric <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, 7.1%; permanent hemodialysis, 3.6%; iliac artery injury requiring endoconduit placement, 3.6%; and brachial plexus nerve injury, 3.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cardiac complications included self-limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (14.3%) and one non-Q-wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (3.6%), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recovering without coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 10.7 months (range, 3-25 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient died of nonaneurysmal-related causes at 3 months (89.3% survival) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postoperative imaging revealed one renal snorkel graft occlusion occurring at 3 months (98.2% overall primary patency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Seven (25%) early endoleaks were noted on the first follow-up computed tomography angiography: two type I, three type II, and two type III (25%), leading to one secondary intervention (3.6%) with bridging cuff placement (type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The small type Ia endoleaks and other type III endoleak resolved at the 6-month scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mean sac regression at the latest follow-up was 7.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has enlarged on postoperative imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early success with the snorkel technique for juxtarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has made it our procedure of choice for complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000470'>short-neck</z:hpo> to no-neck EVAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although long-term follow-up is needed, the flexibility of the snorkel technique and lack of requirement for custom-built devices may make this approach more attractive than branched or fenestrated stent grafts </plain></SENT>
