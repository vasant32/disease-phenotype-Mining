<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains an important myocardial revascularisation strategy, more attention has been paid to the role of numerous factors affecting outcomes after CABG, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies on this issue gave inconsistent results, the dynamics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has been seldom investigated, and only few reports have specifically addressed this problem in Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim: Prospective evaluation of the effect of depressive symptoms and the dynamics of their occurrence on the incidence of cardiac events in patients after CABG during a 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 170 patients aged 63 Â± 10 years, including 17 women and 153 men, who underwent CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms at 2 weeks (0M), 3 months (3M), and 24 months (24M) after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the BDI findings during subsequent follow-up visits, patients were divided into three groups depending on the dynamics of depressive symptoms: Group I without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (67 patients), Group II with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (72 patients), and Group III with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (31 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the 2-year follow-up, we evaluated the incidence of three combined endpoints that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), coronary angioplasty or redo CABG surgery; recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>; and hospitalisations due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or other cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analysed the effect of demographic, clinical, perioperative end psychological parameters to identify independent risk factors for cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, more cardiac events were noted compared to patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> combined endpoints were significantly more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> compared to those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, coronary angioplasty or redo CABG surgery: 19.3% in Group III vs. 5.9% in Group I, p = 0.0437; recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>: 45% in Group III vs. 16.4% in Group I, p = 0.027; hospitalisations due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> or other cardiac causes: 54.8% in Group III vs. 31.3% in Group I, p = 0.0287) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hospitalisation rate was also higher among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> compared to those with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (54.8% in Group III vs. 31.9% in Group II, p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis using a linear regression model, independent risk factors for hospitalisation during the 2-year follow-up included the presence of depressive symptoms in the early postoperative period (p = 0.03) and the BDI score at 3 months after CABG (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Use of antidepressants at baseline was an independent risk factor for recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms, regardless of their dynamics, were not found to be a risk factor for the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, coronary angioplasty or redo CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During a 2-year prospective follow-up of patients after CABG, cardiac events were significantly more common among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (but not incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>) as compared to patients without depressive symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hospitalisation rate among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was significantly higher compared to both patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> or with incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and incidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was not shown to be to be a risk factor for the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI, coronary angioplasty or redo CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Severe depressive symptoms that required the use of antidepressants at baseline were an independent risk factor of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The presence of depressive symptoms at baseline and BDI score at 3 months were independent risk factors for rehospitalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the dynamics of depressive symptoms may have an effect on rehospitalisations in patients after CABG </plain></SENT>
