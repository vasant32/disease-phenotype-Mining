<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> is a novel tridentate oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> that exhibits a half-life suitable for once-daily dosing; however, little is known regarding the effectiveness of this agent in preventing iron-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult male Mongolian gerbils were randomly divided into 3 groups: control, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Iron-overloaded animals received iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally (ip)/5 days for 10 weeks, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> was given 100 mg/kg per d orally (po) for 9 months post iron loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac and aortic iron levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gerbil electro- and echocardiograms were obtained in anesthetized animals at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to control animals, iron concentration was 3.3- and 2.4-fold higher in iron-overloaded heart and aorta, respectively (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment reduced cardiac and aortic iron levels by 32% and 35%, respectively (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with the decrease in cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> observed with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian Blue</z:chebi> iron staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Iron-overloaded gerbils were found to exhibit frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, echocardiographic assessment demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>-associated increase in left ventricular dimensions including left ventricular posterior wall dimension (LVPWd: 49%), left ventricular internal dimension (LVIDd: 26%), and left ventricular septum thickness (LVSd: 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These parameters were significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment (LVPWd: 23%, LVIDd: 24%, and LVSd: 27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Iron overload</z:e> was also associated with reduced ejection fraction (EF: by 30%) and fractional shortening (FS: by 23%) in comparison with controls (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment, these values were higher (EF: by 30%, FS: by 28%) compared to iron-overloaded group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> may be useful for attenuating iron-induced changes in cardiac structure and function </plain></SENT>
