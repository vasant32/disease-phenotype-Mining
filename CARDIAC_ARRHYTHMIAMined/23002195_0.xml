<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this multicentre retrospective data review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> in patients with CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Electrophysiologists at academic medical centres were asked to identify consecutive patients with CS and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical information, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy history, and device complications were collected for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on 235 patients from 13 institutions, 64.7% male with mean age 55.6 ± 11.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 4.0 years, 85 of 234 (36.2%) patients received an appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (shocks and/or anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing) and 67 of 226 (29.7%) received an appropriate shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven of 235 patients (24.3%) received a total of 222 inappropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-six adverse events occurred in 41 of 235 patients (17.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who received appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies were more likely to be male (73.8 vs. 59.6%, P = 0.0330), have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (40.5 vs. 22.5%, P = 0.0044), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (38.1 ± 15.2 vs. 48.8 ± 14.7%, P ≤ 0.0001), ventricular pacing on baseline electrocardiogram (16.1 vs. 2.1%, P = 0.0002), and a secondary prevention indication (60.7 vs. 24.5%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared with those who did not receive appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with CS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> are at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This population also has high rates of inappropriate shocks and device complications </plain></SENT>
