<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome of patients treated with this electrode in this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-two patients (female = 52) with a mean age of 54.9 ± 17.7 years underwent SP elimination for typical AVNRT with the 8-mm tip cryocatheter in our institution between November 2009 to June 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and procedural characteristics were prospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> procedural success defined as AVNRT non-inducibility at the end of the procedure was obtained in 81/82 patients (98.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean procedure duration and fluoroscopy time were 74.4 ± 28.7 min (range, 35-160 min) and 8.7 ± 5.3 min (range, 2-26 min), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean number of energy applications was 4.0 ± 2.4 (range, 2-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> occurred in 12 patients (14.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Traumatic fast pathway conduction block occurred in one patient before cryoenergy delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using an intention-to-treat analysis, 78 patients (95.1 %) remained free of AVNRT recurrence during a mean follow-up of 17.8 ± 9.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that the 8-mm tip cryocatheter is both safe and highly effective for SP conduction elimination in patients with AVNRT and demonstrated a low recurrence rate during a long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
