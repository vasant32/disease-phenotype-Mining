<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Isorhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011709'>atrioventricular dissociation</z:hpo> (IAVD) is a rhythm disturbance in which atria and ventricles are driven by independent pacemakers at equal or nearly equal rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of IAVD in a group of 11 Labrador Retrievers and its possible correlation with focal junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (FJT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: Between December 2004 and October 2010, medical records of 11 Labrador Retrievers with surface electrocardiographic findings compatible with IAVD were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve-lead surface electrocardiograms, thoracic radiographs, and echocardiographic findings of each dog and electrophysiologic mapping results of 3 dogs were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 10 of 11 dogs, the ECG pattern revealed the presence of IAVD with type I synchronization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 10 dogs, IAVD with type I synchronization was interrupted by periods of junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> with 1 : 1 ventriculo-atrial conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of 11 dogs presented IAVD with type II synchronization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ECG diagnosis of IAVD with type I and type II synchronization, and junctional rhythm with 1 : 1 ventriculo-atrial conduction was confirmed in 3 of 11 dogs with endocardial mapping in which the diagnosis of focal junctional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: IAVD with type I synchronization is more common than IAVD with type II synchronization in Labrador Retrievers, and a correlation between IAVD and FJT can be hypothesized </plain></SENT>
