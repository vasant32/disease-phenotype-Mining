<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression and spinal stabilization should be pursued whenever indicated and feasible; however, there is no compelling evidence that early decompression facilitates neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">Methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, the subject of over two decades of trials, has proven to be of marginal benefit in improving functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the management of the respiratory, cardiovascular, autonomic, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, skeletal and integumentary systems have not only changed morbidity and survival of spinal cord injury patients but also improved quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progress has been made in the early diagnosis and effective treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, neurogenic shock, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aggressive respiratory care for high cervical level of injury patients should include an option for phrenic nerve pacing as it is a viable rehabilitative strategy for appropriately selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pressure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> remain a significant psychological, financial, and functional burden for many people with SCI and for healthcare providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This area will continue to require further work on early prevention and education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive scientific and clinical data on neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, there is no consensus regarding the best pharmacotherapeutic agents, dosing regimens, or rehabilitative strategies for prevention and treatment of bone loss </plain></SENT>
