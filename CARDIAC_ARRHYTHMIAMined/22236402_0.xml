<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomized crossover study of healthy adults (n=20), we measured heart rate variability (respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), blood pressure, and other hemodynamic variables after three test meals varying in type and amount of fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements were collected at rest and during speech and cold pressor tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant postmeal changes in resting diastolic blood pressure (-4%), cardiac output (+18%), total peripheral resistance (-17%), and interleukin-6 (-27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability and hemodynamic reactivity to stress was not affected by meal content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend that future studies control for time since last meal and continue to examine effects of meal content on heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
