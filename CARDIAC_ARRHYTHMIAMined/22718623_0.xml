<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated effects of common polymorphisms in Chinese in CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, and ABCB1 on flecainide pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single oral 100-mg doses of flecainide were given to 15 healthy male Chinese subjects who were genotyped for the CYP2D6*2, *5, *10, CYP3A5*3, CYP1A2*1F and ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of flecainide among CYP2D6 (mainly involving *10) genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CYP3A5*3/*3 subjects (n=8) had a 26% higher systemic exposure (AUC0-âˆž) and 17% lower apparent oral clearance of flecainide than the combined group of CYP3A5*1/*1 (n=6) and CYP3A5*1/*3 (n=1) subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects homozygous for CYP1A2*1F tended to have lower systemic exposure and increased clearance of flecainide compared to those with CYP1A2*1A/1F in subjects with at least one CYP2D6 variant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The disposition of flecainide appeared to be influenced by the CYP3A5*3 and possibly the CYP1A2*1F polymorphisms, particularly in subjects with CYP2D6 variant alleles </plain></SENT>
