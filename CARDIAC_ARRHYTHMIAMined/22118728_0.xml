<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation procedures vary widely between different centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to analyze the results and complications of this procedure in our center and identify factors predicting the efficacy and safety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 726 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation procedures were performed in our center between 2002 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning in January 2008, a protocol for anticoagulation and conscious sedation was systematically applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes and complications could therefore be compared in 2 well-differentiated groups: group A included 419 procedures performed prior to 2008 and group B included 307 procedures completed after 2008 using the new protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 8.7 months, 60.9% of patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free after one or repeat procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After only 1 procedure, the success rate was 41% and significantly higher in group B (51.6% vs 35.2% in group A; P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 31 major complications (4.2%), 26 in group A (6.2%) and 5 in group B (1.6%) (P=.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The implementation of the new protocol was an independent predictor of the absence of complications (odds ratio=0.406; 95% confidence interval, 0.214-0.769; P&lt;.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systematic application of an anticoagulation and conscious sedation protocol is associated with improved results and fewer complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors not evaluated in the present study, such as operator experience and ongoing improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation technology, could have influenced these findings </plain></SENT>
