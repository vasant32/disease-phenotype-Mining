<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prototype remote catheter navigation system (RCNS) has been developed to reduce occupational dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety, feasibility of this RCNS and a comparison of remote and conventional navigation techniques is investigated in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven anatomical locations in the right side of the heart in porcine models were chosen as navigation targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using fluoroscopy and electrogram analysis, an experienced electrophysiology interventionalist manipulated a radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter to each target using the RCNS and conventional navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Success rate, navigation time, exposure, exposure time and procedure time was recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> anatomical targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time to integrate the RCNS with the procedure suite was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> targets were successfully reached with the RCNS and conventional navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No erratic catheter motion was observed with the RCNS whereas 1 operation failure occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anatomical targets were found to have the largest effect on navigation time (P &lt; 0.05), exposure (P &lt; 0.05), and exposure time (P &lt; 0.01), although the navigation method had little to no effect on the metrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that remote navigation procedures can be performed with navigation times comparable to conventional bedside navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Remote navigation with the RCNS may present a safe method of reducing occupational dose, while providing comparable navigation time with conventional bedside navigation </plain></SENT>
