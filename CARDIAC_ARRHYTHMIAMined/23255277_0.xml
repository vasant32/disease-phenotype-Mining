<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (pLVADs) are increasingly being used to facilitate ablation of unstable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT), but the safety profile and hemodynamic benefits of these devices have not been described in a systematic, prospective manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with scar VT underwent ablation with a pLVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuromonitoring using cerebral oximetry was performed to evaluate a cerebral desaturation threshold to guide the duration of activation/entrainment mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of pLVAD support was tested in a controlled manner with simulated VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete procedural success was achieved in 50% (n=8) of patients, who were initially inducible for sustained VT, and partial procedural success in 37% (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a cerebral desaturation level of 55% as a lower safety limit to guide the duration of sustained VT, 3 patients (15%) developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resolved), and 1 (5%) patient developed mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During fast simulated VT (300 ms), cerebral desaturation to â‰¤55% occurred in more than half (53%) of patients tested without pLVAD support, compared with only 5% with full pLVAD support (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a consecutive series of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, pLVAD-supported scar VT ablation was safe and feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During fast simulated VT, a miniaturized axial flow pump imparted a more favorable hemodynamic profile compared with pharmacological agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral oximetry is a complimentary monitoring modality during scar VT ablation, and avoidance of cerebral desaturations below a threshold of 55% may safely guide the duration of mapping during unstable VT </plain></SENT>
