<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review describes the main pathophysiological mechanisms of no-reflow, its clinical manifestation, including the strong association with increased in-hospital mortality, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> as well as the diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter ranges from simple angiographic thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> grade score to more complex angiographic indexes, imaging techniques such as myocardial contrast echo or cardiac magnetic resonance, and surrogate clinical end points such as ST-segment resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review also summarizes the strategies of prevention and treatment of no-reflow, considering the most recent studies results regarding medical therapy and devices </plain></SENT>
