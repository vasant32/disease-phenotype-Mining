<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> have been demonstrated to be sensitive to short periods of athletic deconditioning; however, their response to retraining is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at peak training and after 3 to 6 months of deconditioning and was repeated in the present study after 2, 6, and 12 months of retraining in 37 athletes with frequent and complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001626'>cardiovascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These subjects showed partial (101 to 500 ventricular premature complexes [<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>]/24 hours) or marked (&lt;100 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>) reversibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after deconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retraining initially resulted in a significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> frequency compared with deconditioning (from 280 ± 475 to 1,542 ± 2,186 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>; p = 0.005), couplets (0.14 ± 0.42 to 4.4 ± 8.2; p = 0.005), and nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (from 0 to 0.8 ± 1.8; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a progressive reduction was seen in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> during the 1 year of training to well below that at the peak training levels (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> 917 ± 1,630, couplets 1.8 ± 4.2, and nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> 0.4 ± 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> reduction was significantly greater statistically in those athletes with marked reversibility after deconditioning than in the athletes with partial reversibility (69 ± 139 vs 1,496 ± 1,917 <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp>/24 hours, respectively; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cardiac events or symptoms occurred during 1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in elite athletes without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, a resumption in intense training after deconditioning was associated with variable, but prolonged, suppression of ventricular ectopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of adverse clinical events or symptoms associated with the resumption of training supports the continued eligibility in competitive sports for such athletes and is also consistent with the benign nature of physiologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340520" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">athlete's heart</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
