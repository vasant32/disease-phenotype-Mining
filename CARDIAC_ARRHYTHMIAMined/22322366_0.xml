<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials have shown that vernakalant is effective in terminating recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological actions of vernakalant are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we report the results of a blinded study comparing the in vitro canine atrial electrophysiological effects of vernakalant, ranolazine, and dl-sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Action potential durations (APD(50,75,90)), effective refractory period (ERP), post repolarization refractoriness (PRR), maximum rate of rise of the action potential (AP) upstroke (V(max)), diastolic threshold of excitation (DTE), conduction time (CT), and the shortest S(1)-S(1) permitting 1:1 activation (S(1)-S(1)) were measured using standard stimulation and microelectrode recording techniques in isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, non-remodeled canine arterially perfused left atrial preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vernakalant caused variable but slight prolongation of APD(90) (P=not significant), but significant prolongation of APD(50) at 30 Î¼mol/L and rapid rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ranolazine and dl-sotalol produced consistent concentration- and reverse rate-dependent prolongation of APD(90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vernakalant and ranolazine caused rate-dependent, whereas dl-sotalol caused reverse rate-dependent, prolongation of ERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant rate-dependent PRR developed with vernakalant and ranolazine, but not with dl-sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-mediated parameters (ie, V(max), CT, DTE, and S(1)-S(1)) also were depressed significantly by vernakalant and ranolazine, but not by dl-sotalol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only vernakalant elevated AP plateau voltage, consistent with blockade of ultrarapid delayed rectified <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current and transient outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In isolated canine left atria, the effects of vernakalant and ranolazine were characterized by use-dependent inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-mediated parameters, and those of dl-sotalol by reverse rate-dependent prolongation of APD(90) and ERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that during the rapid activation rates of AF, the I(Na) blocking action of the mixed ion channel blocker vernakalant takes prominence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This mechanism may explain vernakalant's anti-AF efficacy </plain></SENT>
