<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation in children have expanded, yet pediatric population-based data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We characterized trends in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> use in the United States from 1997 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined national hospital administrative data from the 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) for new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implants in patients younger than 18 years of age and characterized patients, hospitals, and hospitalization-related outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implants per year increased 3-fold (from 130 in 1997 to 396 in 2006, P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Implants with a concomitant diagnosis of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> decreased from 77% to 45% (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age decreased from 13.6 to 12.2 years (P = .01), and the percentage of patients younger than 5 years of age tended to increase (up to 10%, P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2006, the number of implants per center ranged from 1 to 24 (median 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over time, the complication rate tended to decrease (from 16 to 10%, P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complication rate was not related to a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, age, or implant volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> use increased dramatically in children from 1997 to 2006, although implantation declined in patients with a concomitant diagnosis of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (those likely to undergo implantation for secondary prevention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The complication rate tended to decrease overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Each center implants relatively few <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> per year, which may have implications for competency and training </plain></SENT>
