<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although conventional rhythm stabilization might be of help acutely, ES involves high mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of catheter ablation strategies in the setting of an interhospital collaborative network on the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes and mortality in patients with ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients presenting for invasive treatment of ES from December 2007 to December 2009 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The strategies were adapted to the individual cardiac pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up examination constituted periodic implantable cardioverter defibrillator interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 patients, 29 (91%) had monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of implantable cardioverter defibrillator-treated episodes within 7 days before ablation was 16 Â± 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 32 patients, 27 underwent ablation within 24 hours after admission, and 5 underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ablation within 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, epicardial ablation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients (6%), the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was successfully ablated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 15 months, 10 patients (31%) had recurrences of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, including 2 patients (6%) with recurrent ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients (9%) died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, catheter ablation effectively suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> midterm recurrences in patients presenting with ES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation is complex in these severely sick patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> appears to be 31% and the mortality rate to be 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Collaborative hospital networks to increase the prompt availability of ES ablation might help to optimize the ES outcome </plain></SENT>
