<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This review assesses in which respects a mouse heart is a miniature human heart, a suitable model for studying mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in humans and in which respects human and murine hearts differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Section I considers the issue of scaling of mammalian cardiac (electro) <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> to body mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, we summarize differences between mice and humans in cardiac activation (section II) and the currents underlying the action potential in the murine working myocardium (section III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in cardiac electrophysiology in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> are briefly outlined in section IV, while section V discusses technical considerations pertaining to recording cardiac electrical activity in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, section VI offers general considerations on the influence of cardiac size on the mechanisms of tachy-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
