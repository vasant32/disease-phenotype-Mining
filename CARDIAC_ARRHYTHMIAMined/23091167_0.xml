<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An efficient platform for evaluating cardiac repolarization in vitro significantly facilitates drug developmental programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a proof of principle study, we examined the effect of antiarrhythmogenic drugs (Vaughan Williams class I-IV) and noncardiac active drugs (terfenadine and cisapride) on the repolarization profile of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-free human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracellular field potential (FP) recording using microelectrode arrays demonstrated significant delayed repolarization as prolonged corrected FP durations (cFPDs) by class I (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> and flecainide), class III (sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>), and class IV (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>), whereas class II drugs (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7444">nadolol</z:chebi>) had no effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consistent with their <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-blocking ability, class I drugs also significantly reduced FPmin and conduction velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (class IB) had no effects on cFPDs, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> shortened cFPD and FPmin by 25 and 50%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reduced beating frequencies drastically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the examined drugs exhibited dose-response curve on prolongation of cFPDs at an effective range that correlated significantly with therapeutic plasma concentrations achieved clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with clinical outcomes, drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and bigeminy-like waveforms by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, flecainide, and sotalol was demonstrated at supraphysiological concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, off-target effects of terfenadine and cisapride on cFPD and Na( + ) channel blockage were similarly revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that hiPSC-CMs may be useful for safety evaluation of cardioactive and noncardiac acting drugs for personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
