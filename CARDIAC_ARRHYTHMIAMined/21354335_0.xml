<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myocardial imaging can also identify scars prior to ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between imaging and voltage mapping is not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify the anatomic location and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of scars as obtained by electroanatomic mapping with contrast-enhanced MRI (CeMRI) and histopathology, and to characterize the distribution of late potentials in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> porcine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vivo 3-dimensional cardiac CeMRI was performed in 5 infarcted porcine hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-density electroanatomic mapping was used to generate epicardial and endocardial voltage maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scar surface area and position on CeMRI were then correlated with voltage maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Locations of late potentials were subsequently identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These were classified according to their duration and fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hearts underwent histopathological examination after mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total dense scar surface area and location on CeMRI correlated to the total epicardial and endocardial surface scar on electroanatomic maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomic mapping (average of 1,532 Â± 480 points per infarcted heart) showed that fractionated late potentials were more common in dense scars (&lt;0.50 mV) as compared with border zone regions (0.51 to 1.5 mV), and were more commonly observed on the epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In vivo, CeMRI can identify areas of transmural and nontransmural dense scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fractionated late diastolic potentials are more common on the epicardium than the endocardium in dense scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for catheter ablation of VT and for targeting the delivery of future therapies to scarred regions </plain></SENT>
