<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Achieve catheter (AC) is a novel inner lumen catheter designed to be used in conjunction with the CB, which serves the double purpose of a guidewire and a mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of CB ablation in conjunction with the novel AC, in terms of PVI and safety in a series of patients affected by drug resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy patients (49 male) affected by paroxysmal AF were assigned to CB PVI using the AC as a mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent loop-Holter monitoring 1, 3 and 6 months after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isolation occurred in 98% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> with the CB-AC association without having switching to a regular guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein isolation could be documented by real-time (RT) recordings in 47% (132) of veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time to isolation was significantly longer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> exhibiting early left atrium-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnection if compared with veins with sustained isolation (117 ± 25 s vs. 59 ± 25 s; P&lt; 0,005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No serious complications occurred; four transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1442879" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">phrenic nerve palsies</z:e> occurred <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resolving completely before the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon ablation in conjunction with the novel AC is feasible, safe, and most importantly affords PVI in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> veins without having to switch to a regular guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, RT recordings could be documented in only 47% of pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
