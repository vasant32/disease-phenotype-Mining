<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to describe clinical outcomes with this ablation strategy in patients (pts) followed for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred pts underwent PVAI for longstanding persistent AF and were followed for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three pts with &lt;1-year follow-up and 37 pts with additional RF atrial ablation were excluded, leaving 130 pts for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 130 pts (108 men, mean LA 4.7 ± 0.6 cm, mean AF duration of 38 ± 44 months) underwent PVAI with entrance/exit block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 24 pts (15 pts during the initial procedure and 9 additional pts at repeat ablations) had 40 non-PVTA, including 3 with AVNRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) was noted in 7 (5%) pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AF-free survival after single procedure without antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repeat AF or AFL ablation was performed in 37 pts (28%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnection uniformly identified (3.7 ± 0.5 veins/pt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During mean follow-up of 41.1 ± 23.8 months (range 12-103 months), 85/130 pts (65%) were in sinus rhythm with 65 pts (50%) off AAD, 20 pts (15%) on AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 9 pts (7%) have had rare episodes of AF such that 72% of pts have had good long-term clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 pts with recurrent AF, 20 pts have not had a repeat procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVAI with non-PVTA for longstanding persistent AF provides good long-term AF control in over 70% of patients with infrequent (5%) AFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AAD therapy and repeat PVAI may be required for this optimal outcome </plain></SENT>
