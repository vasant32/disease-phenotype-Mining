<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and morphological characteristics of LAD in patients referred for radiofrequency transcatheter ablation of AF with dual-source computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Dual-source computed tomography images were obtained in 214 patients referred for AF catheter ablation and 214 sex- and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Images were analyzed to determine the prevalence and morphological characteristics of LAD and their relationship with adjacent pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AF patients 77 (36.0%) (95% confidence interval, 29.6-42.4%) had 90 LAD, whereas in control subjects 70 (32.7%) (95% confidence interval, 26.4-39.0%) had 81 LAD (P=0.551) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with AF, LAD locations were right anterosuperior (47.8%), left anterosuperior (8.9%), left lateral (32.2%), interatrial septum (4.4%), right inferior (5.6%), and posterosuperior (1.1%) walls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean size of LAD was 5.3±2.9×5.6±3.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The wall of the LAD was much thinner than that of adjacent left atrium (0.89±0.46 versus 2.39±0.83 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most LAD were located close to a pulmonary vein or atrial appendage ostium, with a mean distance of 8.7-13.1 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LAD are common, with a prevalence of 36.0% in patients with AF, which is not statistically greater than that in patients without AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thin-walled LAD are more commonly located on the superior anterior wall of left atrium and close to common ablation sites </plain></SENT>
