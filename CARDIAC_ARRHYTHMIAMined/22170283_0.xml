<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Bipolar endocardial signal amplitude (BESA) &lt;1.5 mV defines scar in the left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known if LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (LVH) increases overall bipolar signal amplitude and if scar identification with LVH requires a higher voltage cutoff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the LV BESA of four patients with moderate LVH on echo (≥1.6 cm) to that of ten consecutive patients with no LVH with both groups having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function and no scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in 12 patients with ischemic scar (ICM) and moderate LVH (≥1.6 cm), we assessed scar area and percent abnormal electrograms (width &gt;80 ms and/or split/fractionated) using 1.5 and 2.5 mV defined border zone cutoff values and compared results to those from 12 ICM patients with no LVH matched for age, sex, scar distribution, and LV ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average BESA in the setting of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function/no scar was comparable in patients with (4.7 ± 3.0 mV, 95% signals &gt;1.58 mV) and those without LVH (4.9 ± 1.6 mV, 95% signals &gt;1.62 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with ICM and LVH versus without LVH, there was a smaller area of dense scar &lt;0.5 mV/total scar (15% versus 23%, p = 0.03) but no significant difference in the size of the border zone, or percentage of abnormal electrograms identified within border zones defined by either the 0.5-1.5 mV or 0.5-2.5 mV cutoff values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with and without LVH with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> systolic function show similar LV endocardial bipolar signal characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modifying the bipolar amplitude cutoff at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border zone did not increase overall scar size in patients with versus those without LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 1.5 mV-bipolar voltage cutoff used for scar definition seems appropriate even in patients with marked LVH </plain></SENT>
