<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an important treatment modality for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with reduced ejection fraction and ventricular conduction delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering limited health care budgets in an aging population, adding a defibrillator function to CRT remains a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe the experience of a high-volume Belgian implantation centre with CRT with/without defibrillator (CRT-D/P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive CRT patients (n = 221), implanted between October 2008 and April 2011 in Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Genk), were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 209 primo-implantations, 74 CRT-D and 98 CRT-P patients with complete follow-up inside the centre, were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite differences in baseline characteristics, both groups demonstrated similar reverse left ventricular remodelling, improvement in New York Heart Association functional class and maximal aerobic capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During mean follow-up of 18 +/- 9 months, 21 patients died and 83 spent a total of 1200 days in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Annual mortality was 8% and equal among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> differed between CRT-D (predominantly pump failure) and CRT-P patients (pump failure, comorbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The yearly population attributable risk of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was 8.16% in CRT-D and 1.38% in CRT-P patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With current guidelines applied to the Belgian reimbursement criteria and at physicians'discretion, patient selection for CRT-D/ CRT-P was appropriate, with similar reverse remodelling, functional capacity improvement and good clinical outcome in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-risk patients for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were more likely to receive CRT-D, although the yearly attributable risk remained 1.38% in CRT-P patients </plain></SENT>
