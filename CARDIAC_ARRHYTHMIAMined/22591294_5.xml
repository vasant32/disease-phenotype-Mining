<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25105">macrolide antibiotics</z:chebi> are proarrhythmic and associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> is thought to have minimal cardiotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, published reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> may increase the risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a Tennessee Medicaid cohort designed to detect an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to short-term cardiac effects of medication, excluding patients with serious noncardiovascular illness and person-time during and shortly after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cohort included patients who took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> (347,795 prescriptions), propensity-score-matched persons who took no antibiotics (1,391,180 control periods), and patients who took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2676">amoxicillin</z:chebi> (1,348,672 prescriptions), ciprofloxacin (264,626 prescriptions), or levofloxacin (193,906 prescriptions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 5 days of therapy, patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi>, as compared with those who took no antibiotics, had an increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79 to 4.63; P&lt;0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.75; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2676">amoxicillin</z:chebi> had no increase in the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2676">amoxicillin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.38 to 4.50; P=0.002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.30; P=0.005), with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 1 million courses; patients in the highest decile of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> had an estimated 245 additional cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> per 1 million courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly greater with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> than with ciprofloxacin but did not differ significantly from that with levofloxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During 5 days of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> therapy, there was a small absolute increase in cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, which was most pronounced among patients with a high baseline risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
