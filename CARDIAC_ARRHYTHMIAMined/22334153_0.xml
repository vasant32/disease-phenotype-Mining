<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnostic Brugada-electrocardiogram (Br-ECG) is characterized by "coved-type" ST-segment elevation (type 1) in V(1) to V(2)/V(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test is clinically used to unmask diagnostic Br-ECG in patients with nondiagnostic "<z:mp ids='MP_0000162'>saddle-back</z:mp>" Br-ECG (type 2 and type 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blockers test in individuals with a nondiagnostic Br-ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 153 consecutive patients (128 men; age 41.7 ± 14.0 years) with a type 2/3 Br-ECG who underwent a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test with either flecainide (48%) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nondiagnostic Br-ECGs were identified during the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> in 5 patients (3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in 36 (24%), cascade family screening in 48 (31%), and incidental ECG in 64 (42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A spontaneous type 1 Br-ECG was systematically excluded by serial ECGs (6.1 ± 0.4) and recording of right precordial leads both at standard and second and third intercostal spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test result was positive in 76 (50%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 59 ± 33 months, 9 (5.9%) patients experienced events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (n = 4), appropriate interventions of defibrillator (n = 4), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test was associated with a significantly higher event rate in symptomatic patients (P = .01) but not in asymptomatic individuals (P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No events occurred among asymptomatic individuals with an incidental nondiagnostic Br-ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic individuals with a nondiagnostic Br-ECG, the incidence of events is low regardless of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test result while in symptomatic patients a positive <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel blocker test result is associated with an adverse arrhythmic outcome and may contribute to risk stratification </plain></SENT>
