<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Truly long-term follow-up data after transcatheter closure (TC) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e>) are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the 5- to 20-year outcomes of TC and surgical closure (SC) for typical <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the records of patients with isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> and right ventricular volume overload who underwent TC or SC (January 1, 1986 to September 30, 2005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was obtained through a combination of chart review, physician records, and telephone survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 375 patients (207 SC and 168 TC) and obtained follow-up data &gt;5 years (median follow-up 10 years) for 300 (152 SC, 148 TC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients have died (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The New York Heart Association functional class was unchanged in 227 patients, improved in 25, and was worse in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was found in 28 patients (9.3%); 21% aged &gt;40 years developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the odds of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> tended to be greater in the SC group, but this was statistically insignificant (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 3.9, p = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age and preprocedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, but not TC or SC, were independent risk factors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the incidence of late, probably embolic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the TC (3%) versus SC (2%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, long-term outcomes after <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> closure using modern methods are excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between TC versus SC with regard to survival, functional capacity, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, or embolic neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and neurologic events remain long-term risks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure, especially if the patient had pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
