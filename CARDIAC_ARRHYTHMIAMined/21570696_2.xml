<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term follow-up of minimally invasive epicardial ablation of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has been encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred four patients with drug-refractory isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> underwent minimally invasive surgical ablation through right 3- to 4-cm minithoracotomy by isolation of pulmonary veins and were followed-up for an average of 17 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous failed transcatheter ablation was not a criterion for this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic drugs were continued until postoperative month 6, despite demonstration of stable sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was confirmed to be safe (1 case of procedure-related morbidity, no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>) and effective (89% overall freedom from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at follow-up, 96% freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 80% freedom from persisting type <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results tended to improve with the expansion of the surgical experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cox hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis identified persisting type <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008726'>enlarged left atrium</z:mp> as the major predictors of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Health-related quality of life was confirmed to be improved at the end of the follow-up relative to baseline in most Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive epicardial ablation of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> yields stable, gradually improving results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier surgical referral is justifiable after careful cardiologic work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To define the relative roles of minimally invasive ablation and transcatheter ablation, which may be considered in the future as alternative therapies, a randomized trial to compare these procedures is advisable </plain></SENT>
