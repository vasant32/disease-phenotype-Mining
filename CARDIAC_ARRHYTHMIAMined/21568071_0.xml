<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The impact of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) severity on the number of exacerbations, and the interdependence of COPD and some concomitant diseases were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pulmonary patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the actual influence of some risk factors and comorbidity on the course of COPD, we conducted a study in two family medicine consulting offices, one in the city of Split and the other on the island of Brac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included a sample of 64 subjects, mean age 64.43 years, divided into two groups of 32 subjects each (group 1 and group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After taking history data and clinical examination, spirometry was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of COPD was determined on the basis of lung function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 15 (46.9%) smokers in group 1, seven of them former smokers, and 20 (65.6%) smokers in group 2, eight of them former smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups differed significantly according to the mean number of annual exacerbations (1.3 in group 1 and 2.4 in group 2; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of exacerbations was higher in smokers and depended on the stage of COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If COPD was more severe, the exacerbations were more frequent and influenced the progression of irreversible functional changes on the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Productive cough was more frequent in smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation of concomitant diseases and degree of COPD was found in group 2 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, r = 0.305; p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group 1, there was correlation between patient age and concomitant disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, r = 0.307; p = 0.013), whereas in group 2 it was significant in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (r = 0.474; p &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (r = 0.301; p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Cigarette smoke causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory changes in the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our study, the number of patients suffering from persistent cough accompanied by sputum was higher in group 2, which also comprised of more smokers, but differences between smokers and non-smokers according to this characteristic were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Study groups differed significantly according to the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">COPD exacerbations</z:e> per year (with more exacerbations in the group with more smokers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In group 2, there was a correlation between COPD severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity of COPD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> was confirmed, along with correlation between age and cardiovascular complications in patients with COPD </plain></SENT>
