<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the aVR lead in ECG differentiation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) and atrioventricular reciprocating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 12-lead ECG was recorded in 150 consecutive patients (96 women, mean age, 45 ± 13.5 years) with drug-refractory regular PSVT during both sinus rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ECGs were reviewed by two experienced electrophysiologists who had no knowledge of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ECG recordings were evaluated for standard criteria as well as our newly proposed criterion of pseudo-r' in the lead aVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was confirmed by the electrophysiological study and the successful catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AVNRT were older (50 ± 10 vs. 37 ± 15 years, P = 0.001), predominantly female (71 vs. 53%, P = 0.03), and presented with slower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (175 ± 25 vs. 186 ± 26 b.p.m., P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the ECG criteria of the AVRT diagnosis, visible P-wave with RP interval ≥ 100 ms had highest diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 79%, specificity 87%, and positive predictive value 79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For AVNRT diagnosis, pseudo-r' in aVR had a higher sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values compared with the conventional criteria of the pseudo-r' in V1 and pseudo-s in inferior leads (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: New criterion of pseudo-r' in lead aVR appears to be more accurate than the standard ECG criteria for ECG diagnosis of AVNRT </plain></SENT>
