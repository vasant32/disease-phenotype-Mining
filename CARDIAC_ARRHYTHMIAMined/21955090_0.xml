<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our objective was to determine whether patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF have an abnormal electroanatomic substrate within the left atrium (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with AF (17 paroxysmal AF and 14 persistent AF) were compared with 15 age-matched controls with left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-density 3-dimensional electroanatomic maps were created and the LA was divided into 8 segments for regional analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bipolar voltage, conduction, and effective refractory periods (ERPs) of the posterior LA, left atrial appendage (LAA), and distal coronary sinus (CSd) and percentage complex signals were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the majority of LA regions, compared with controls, AF patients had: (1) lower mean voltage and a higher percentage low voltage; (2) slower conduction; and (3) more prevalent complex signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many of these changes were more marked in the persistent than the paroxysmal AF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF have lower regional voltage, increased proportion of low voltage, slowed conduction, and increased proportion of complex signals compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many of these changes are more pronounced in persistent AF patients, suggesting there may be a progressive nature to the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences occurred in the absence of structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These substrate abnormalities provide further insight into the progressive nature of atrial remodeling and the mechanisms involved in maintenance of AF </plain></SENT>
