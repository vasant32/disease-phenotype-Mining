<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Long-standing persistent (LSP) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is the most challenging <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> has reached satisfactory results for the long-term treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, but not for the treatment of LSP <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several approaches with various outcomes have been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to summarize the ablation approach that we developed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: During ablation of LSP <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, in addition to pulmonary vein antrum and posterior wall isolation, ablation of nonpulmonary vein triggers disclosed by high dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> seems to be of utmost importance to achieve long-term success after a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The location of the nonpulmonary vein triggers includes the coronary sinus, the anterior part of the septum, the left atrial appendage and the superior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> during ablation does not seem to influence the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing radiofrequency power from 30 up to 45 W seems an important factor to favour durable lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The approach described in this review will guide the reader to what we believe is the best approach for the ablation of patients with LSP <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
