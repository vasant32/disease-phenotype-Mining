Raipaics has been extensively used to treat various kinds of disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in China for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to recent studies, its antiarrhythmic actions are attributable to the active component, acehytisine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: The effects of acehytisine on the spontaneous activity in sinoatrial nodes and the electropharmacological action of this drug on I(f) in pacemaker cells and hHCN4 channels in oocytes were to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sinoatrial nodes were cut from rabbit heart, and transmembrane potentials were recorded by standard microelectrode technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A whole-cell patch clamp technique was employed to record I(f) isolated enzymatically from rabbit sinoatrial node pacemaker cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Human HCN4 channels were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Acehytisine decreased the pacemaker rate of firing and slope of diastolic depolarization, modified the action potential configurations and blocked I(f) in rabbit sinoatrial node cells and hHCN4 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent and non-use-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its electropharmacological properties were consistent with those of a close-state blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings are likely to shed light on the clinical application of acehytisine in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
