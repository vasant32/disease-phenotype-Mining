<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coupled with a better understanding of how patient factors and anti-arrhythmic drug therapy affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> function, these changes have resulted in a modern <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> system which is highly effective at terminating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to a marked decrease in the conduct of intraoperative defibrillation testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Still, clinicians are faced with patients who have had unsuccessful intraoperative defibrillation testing or who have experienced one or more failed clinical shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, clinicians caring for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients must understand the expected performance of modern <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> systems, understand the issues with intraoperative defibrillation testing, and have a strategy for dealing with patients when their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> has failed to terminate a clinical or induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on the clinical approach to such patients, including trouble-shooting and system revision </plain></SENT>
