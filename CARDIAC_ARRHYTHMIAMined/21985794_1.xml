<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They result in typical wide Quantronic Resonance System (QRS) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on the sinus rhythm electrocardiographic characteristics are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients with accessory pathways of anterograde decremental conduction properties were studied retrospectively (10 atriofascicular pathways and 20 decremental atrioventricular pathways) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a pre-excited atrioventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> with anterograde conduction over anterograde decrementally conducting fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients fulfilled criteria of minimal pre-excitation during sinus rhythm before ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients (33%), delta wave was absent, and the only abnormality was terminal QRS slurring or notching on the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was mainly in leads I, V5, and V6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After ablation, terminal QRS slurring or notching disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also did a survey in a control group comprised of 200 subjects without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> who were matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Terminal QRS slurring or notching was found in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high prevalence of terminal QRS slurring or notching in patients with atriofascicular or decremental atrioventricular pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It can be the sole manifestation of such accessory pathways during sinus rhythm, and disappearance of terminal slurring or notching can be the only hallmark of successful ablation visible on the surface ECG </plain></SENT>
