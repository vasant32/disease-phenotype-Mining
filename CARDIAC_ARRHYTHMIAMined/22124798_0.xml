<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In randomized studies, female patients are underrepresented and data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is a determinant of poor prognosis but has not been consistently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the risk factors for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation for primary prophylaxis were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, detected sustained episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis controlled for propensity score was used to evaluate the correlation between gender, history of AF, and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 400 patients (19.8% female; n = 79) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 64 patients (16%) had appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men (18%) had significantly more often episodes than women (8%; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of AF (102, 25.5%) had significantly more often episodes (30%) compared to patients without a history of AF (11%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate model, only gender (p = 0.02) and history of AF (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated predictors of the occurrence of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on the propensity score model, the adjusted hazard ratio for male gender was 2.7 (p = 0.02) and 2.6 (p = 0.0004) for history of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Male gender and history of AF are independent predictors for the occurrence of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to evaluate whether history of AF in female patients might be an indicator for higher risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
