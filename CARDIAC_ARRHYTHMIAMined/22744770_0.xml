<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young women with such disorders often wish to embark on pregnancy, but pregnancy outcome data for this group is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore evaluated pregnancy outcome in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> in situ, who had pregnancy care provided by the specialist maternal cardiology service at University College London Hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for 19 pregnancies in 14 women were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying cardiac diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (one), familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (eight), familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (one), inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (one), and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three women had moderate impairment of the left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction &lt;45%), in the remainder it was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implants were for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (64%) and five for secondary prevention (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 pregnancies, 18 continued beyond 24 weeks gestation with 18 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In eight pregnancies there were medical or device-related complications (42.9%) as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (four) (21.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (two) (9.1%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks (one) (5.3%), atrial lead fracture (one) (5.3%), and lead-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (one) (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no inappropriate device shocks or therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implant can have a good outcome during pregnancy but medical and device complications are not uncommon </plain></SENT>
