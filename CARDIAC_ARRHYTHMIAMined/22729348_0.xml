<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a sub-cellular model of myocardium, we studied the mechanism of block caused by tissue microstructure remodeling: cell geometry [quantified as length/width (L/W) cell ratio] and cell-to-cell coupling (G(j)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneities</z:hpo> in cell L/W ratio and G ( j ) lead to block when excitability is reduced and the corresponding space constant Î» (in the direction of propagation) increases by &gt;40 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue architectures with elongated cells (i.e. large cell L/W ratios) that are better coupled (i.e. large G(j)) are less prone to block at sites of regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneities</z:hpo> in cell geometry and/or cell coupling than tissue architectures consisting of cells with smaller L/W ratios and/or poorer coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whether an increase in tissue anisotropic ratio (ANR) is arrhythmogenic or not depends on the cellular mechanism of the increase: ANR leads to an increased risk of block when G(j) decreases, but to a decreased risk of block when cell L/W ratio increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings are useful to understand the mechanisms of block in cardiac pathologies that result in tissue architecture remodeling </plain></SENT>
