<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosing blunt cardiac injury (BCI) can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients with mechanism for BCI are admitted to the critical care setting based on associated injuries; however, debate surrounds those patients who are hemodynamically stable and do not otherwise require a higher level of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To allow safe discharge home or admission to a nonmonitored setting, BCI should be definitively ruled out in those at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) practice management guideline (PMG) updates the original from 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>English-language citations were queried for BCI from March 1997 through December 2011, using the PubMed Entrez interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 599 articles identified, prospective or retrospective studies examining BCI were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each article was reviewed by two members of the EAST BCI PMG workgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were collated, and a consensus was obtained for the recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 35 institutional studies evaluating the diagnosis of adult patients with suspected BCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This PMG has 10 total recommendations, including two Level 2 updates, two upgrades from Level 3 to Level 2, and three new recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electrocardiogram (ECG) alone is not sufficient to rule out BCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on four studies showing that the addition of troponin I to ECG improved the negative predictive value to 100%, we recommend obtaining an admission ECG and troponin I from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom BCI is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BCI can be ruled out only if both ECG result and troponin I level are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, a significant change from the previous guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with new ECG changes and/or elevated troponin I should be admitted for monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Echocardiogram is not beneficial as a screening tool for BCI and should be reserved for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The presence of a sternal fracture alone does not predict BCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> from BCI in trauma patients </plain></SENT>
