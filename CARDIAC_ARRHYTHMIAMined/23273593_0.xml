<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequent ventricular ectopy can be associated with deterioration of cardiac function and may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>-induced inter- and/or intraventricular dyssynchrony has been postulated as the main mechanism underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>-induced left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For risk stratification, <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> can not be regarded to be a benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as in an apparently healthy subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, any potential survival benefits to be derived from suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> or nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> may be offset by the negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and may be masked by the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that is already high in this subgroup of patients. β-Blockers are currently considered to be the first-line therapy, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> as a back-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation, although invasive and not without procedural risk, avoids the common adverse effects of currently available antiarrhythmic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From a standpoint of preventing or reversing left ventricular dysfunction, frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPCs</z:mp> should be treated earlier regardless of their site of origin or the presence of associated symptoms, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation may be the preferable approach in selected patients, particularly when β-blocker therapy has been ineffective or not tolerated </plain></SENT>
