<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fewer articles have described the potential arrhythmogenic risk related to chocolate intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004763'>paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in a woman after consumption of large quantity of chocolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented to us with complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> after consuming large amounts of chocolate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> at 165 beats per minute, which was restored to sinus rhythm after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiology studies showed atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chocolate contains <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28946">theobromine</z:chebi>, which are <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25348">methylxanthines</z:chebi> and are competitive <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and can have arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case very well describes an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> precipitated by large amount of chocolate consumption in a patient with underlying substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are occasional case reports describing association between chocolate, <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A large Danish study, however, did not find any association between amount of daily <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> consumption and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
