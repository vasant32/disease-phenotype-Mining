<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is common and associated with impaired long-term survival and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is also prevalent in patients with other severe, non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> has not yet been systematically tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 595 patients with obstructive (OD, 54.8%) or restrictive disease (RD, 45.2%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (CRF), anthropometric data, laboratory parameters, lung function, blood gases and comorbidities were assessed prior to initiation of home mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as anaemic based on <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels (Hb&lt;12/13 g/dl, female patients/male patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with known causes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with CRF the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was 13.3% and not different between RD (11.5%) and OD (14.7%) (p=0.276) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A sex-related difference occurred only in OD [7.9% (f) vs. 17.3% (m); p=0.035] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with OD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> presented with higher age (p=0.003), pH (p=0.014) and arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2) ) (p=0.012), lower body mass index (BMI) (p=0.011) and total protein (p=0.012) and higher rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (p=0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p=0.014) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (p=0.003) in comparison to non-anaemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with RD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was associated with higher age, (p=0.008), pH (p=0.011) and lower leucocytes numbers (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> is frequent not only in COPD but also in other severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> combined with CRF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was associated with advanced age, several comorbidities, impaired nutritional state and elevations of pH and PaO(2) , probably because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its prognostic impact has to be elucidated in future studies </plain></SENT>
