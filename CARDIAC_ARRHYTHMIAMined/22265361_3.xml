<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between stimulant use and risk of cardiovascular events and symptoms in youth with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder and compared the risks associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Claims were reviewed of privately insured young people 6 to 21 years old without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (n = 171,126) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A day-level cohort analysis evaluated the risk of cardiovascular events after a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder in relation to stimulant exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on filled stimulant prescriptions, follow-up days were classified as current, past, and no stimulant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endpoints included an emergency department or inpatient diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, cardiac dysrhythmia, or transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (cardiac events) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (cardiac symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 0.92 new cardiac events and 3.08 new cardiac symptoms per 1,000,000 days of current stimulant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with no stimulant use (reference group), the adjusted odds ratios of cardiac events were 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.42-1.12) during current stimulant use and 1.18 (95% CI 0.83-1.66) during past stimulant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The corresponding adjusted odds ratios for cardiac symptoms were 1.18 (95% CI 0.89-1.59) for current and 0.93 (95% CI 0.71-1.21) for past stimulant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in risks of cardiovascular events (2.14, 95% CI 0.82-5.63) or symptoms (1.08, 95% CI 0.66-1.79) for current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> use compared with <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> use (reference group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnoses of cardiovascular events and symptoms were rare and not associated with stimulant use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results help to allay concerns over the cardiovascular safety of stimulant treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> disorder in young people without known pre-existing risk factors </plain></SENT>
