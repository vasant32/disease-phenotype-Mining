<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we have observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> in children when MUF is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such alterations may elicit severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, no studies have focused on the effects MUF may have in plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K) and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (Mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of our study was to determine if there is any variation in plasma levels of K (plK) and Mg (plMg) after MUF in children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients: Sixteen children scheduled for cardiac surgery with CBP and MUF were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi>, CPB and MUF management were standardized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the latter lasting for 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma K average levels before and after MUF were 4.16 mmol/L and 3.58 mmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average plasma Mg levels before and after MUF were 4.82 mmol/L and 4.81 mmol/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The plasma level of K is reduced by 13.7% after MUF (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction in Mg at the same period of time was not statistically significant (p&lt;0.970) </plain></SENT>
