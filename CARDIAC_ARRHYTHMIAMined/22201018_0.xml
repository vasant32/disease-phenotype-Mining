<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We sought to compare two stylet shapes to achieve mid-septal lead placement, as well as the utility of a novel right anterior oblique (RAO) fluoroscopic landmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing pacemaker implantation were enrolled into four consecutive groups according to stylet shape: a standard curve [two-dimensional (2D) stylet] or with an additional distal posterior curve [three-dimensional (3D) stylet], and whether RAO fluoroscopy was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left oblique anterior (LAO) and postero-anterior (PA) fluoroscopic views were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After implantation, validation of right ventricular lead position (septal vs. anterior) was performed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 113 patients were included, of whom lead position could be validated in 106 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Septal position was achieved in only 10 of 22 (45%) patients in the 2D stylet group and in 17 of 23 (74%) patients in the 3D stylet group (P = 0.07) when only PA and LAO fluoroscopy were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were significantly improved by additional use of RAO fluoroscopy, with successful septal placement in 25 of 28 (89%) patients in the 2D stylet + RAO group (P = 0.001) and 32 of 33 (97%) patients in the 3D stylet + RAO group (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A septal lead position was obtained in only about half of the patients when a 2D stylet was used with only LAO and PA fluoroscopic views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 3D stylet was useful to attain the target position, and additional RAO fluoroscopy significantly improved success rate with both stylet shapes </plain></SENT>
