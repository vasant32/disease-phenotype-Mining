<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The coordinated functions can be simulated by computational cardiac cell models, which could not only overcome the practical and ethical limitations in physical experiments but also provide predictive insights on the underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation is aimed at modeling the variations of cardiac electrical signaling due to changes in glycosylation of a voltage-gated K+ channel, hERG, responsible for late phase 2 and phase 3 of the human ventricular AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The voltage-dependence of hERG channels steady-state activation and inactivation under four glycosylation conditions, i.e., full glycosylation, reduced sialylation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-rich and N-Glycanase treated, demonstrated that reduced glycosylation modulates hERG channel gating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, the proposed multi-scale computer model incorporates the measured changes in hERG channel gating observed under conditions of reduced glycosylation, and further predicts the electrical behaviors of cardiac cells and tissues (cable/ring) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The multi-scale modeling results show that reduced glycosylation would act to shorten the repolarization period of cardiac APs, and distort the AP propagation in cardiac tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This multi-scale modeling investigation reveals novel mechanisms of hERG channel modulation by regulated glycosylation that also impact cardiac myocyte and tissue functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can potentially lead to new pharmaceutical treatments and drug designs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
