<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical ablation for SA-AF can now be successfully performed utilizing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study provides an overview of state-of-the-art MIS for the treatment of SA-AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies selected for this review were identified on PUBMED and exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied to select the publication to be screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight studies were included; 27 (96.4%) were observational in nature whereas 1 was prospective non-randomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total number of patients was 1051 (range 14-114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age ranged from 45.3 to 67.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal results were obtained when employing microwave and high focused ultrasound energies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MIS ablation of SA-AF achieved satisfactory 1-year results when the bipolar radiofrequency was employed as energy source, with antiarrhythmic drug-free success rate comparable to percutaneous catheter ablation (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The success rate in paroxysmal was even higher than in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, ganglionated plexi ablation and left atrial appendage removal seem not to influence the recurrence of AF and the occurrence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive surgery ablation of SA-AF achieved satisfactory 1-year results when the bipolar radiofrequency was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the relatively high complication rate reported suggest that such techniques require further refinement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, the preliminary results of the hybrid approach are promising but they need to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
