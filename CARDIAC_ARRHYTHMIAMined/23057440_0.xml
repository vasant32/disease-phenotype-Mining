<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases of poor or negative morphologic findings at autopsy and poor or negative test results from laboratory, diagnostic quandary can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The grant project IGA MZ CR (Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic) targets cases of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> of young people under 40 years of age, where, even after an autopsy performed, and other laboratory examinations at the Department of Forensic Medicine are completed, it fails to detect the exact cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as a possible etiology is supposed malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The project aims to introduce a genetic analysis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> of individuals and determine the frequency of genetic pathologies related to malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, as well as clinical examination of direct relatives of the deceased by cardiologist, focusing on the identification of families at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This examination and identification of causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> will offer bereaved relatives prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article summarizes a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> of young people with a focus on monitoring diagnosed and unspecified cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and an analysis by age, gender and time of day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the age range 1-40 years, the authors found less than 15 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> cases where it was not possible after performing autopsies or laboratory examinations to establish a clear cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In such cases, it is considered category of hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1720983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">channelopathies</z:e> such as largely the congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long-QT syndromes</z:hpo> as possible etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors consider useful to offer cardiological investigation to the relatives of the deceaseds, as well as genetic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden deaths</z:hpo> (molecular autopsy) and their relatives, which in the Czech Republic is not usually performed.Keywords: sudden and unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> - malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> - <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LQT</z:e> syndrome - molecular autopsy </plain></SENT>
