<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: RyR2 mutations are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, a condition characterized by ventricular and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present experiments investigate the atrial electrophysiology of homozygotic murine RyR2-P2328S (RyR2(S/S)) hearts for ectopic triggering events and for conduction abnormalities that might provide a re-entrant substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electrocardiograph recordings were made from regularly stimulated RyR2(S/S) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) hearts, perfused using a novel modified Langendorff preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This permitted the simultaneous use of either floating intracellular microelectrodes to measure action potential (AP) parameters, or a multielectrode array to measure epicardial conduction velocity (CV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RyR2(S/S) showed frequent sustained tachyarrhythmias, delayed afterdepolarizations and ectopic APs, increased interatrial conduction delays, reduced epicardial CVs and reduced maximum rates of AP depolarization ((dV/dt)(max)), despite similar effective refractory periods, AP durations and AP amplitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effective interatrial CVs and (dV/dt)(max) values of APs following ectopic (S2) stimulation were lower than those of APs following regular stimulation and decreased with shortening S1S2 intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, although RyR2(S/S) atria showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> over a wider range of S1S2 intervals, the interatrial CV and (dV/dt)(max) of S2 APs provoking such <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were similar in RyR2(S/S) and WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) homoeostasis produces both arrhythmic triggers and a slow-conducting arrhythmic substrate in RyR2(S/S) atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar mechanism might also contribute to arrhythmogenesis in other conditions, associated with diastolic Ca(2+) release, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
