<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Emergency electrical intervention for patients in the form of defibrillation, cardioversion and external cardiac pacing can be life saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Advances in medical technology have enabled electrical intervention to be delivered from small, portable devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the rising use of air transport for patients, electrical intervention during aeromedical transfer has an increasing incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe the incidence of electrical intervention in a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients undergoing aeromedical transfer and review the risks associated with electrical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> secondary retrievals undertaken by a national aeromedical critical care retrieval service were reviewed over a 48-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a mixed medical and trauma critical care population, 11 of 967 (1.1%) secondary retrievals required electrical intervention during aeromedical critical care retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of these patients was 77 years (range 32-86) and the median transport time was 70 min (range 40-100 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients had an underlying primary cardiac condition and had been identified as high risk for developing an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrical intervention in a transport environment brings unique challenges, particularly during aeromedical transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study in a European model shows that there is a small but significant incidence of electrical intervention required during aeromedical flight for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are potential safety issues with electrical intervention in aeromedical flight; therefore, any service involved in the transport of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients needs to have a robust procedure in place to deliver this safely </plain></SENT>
