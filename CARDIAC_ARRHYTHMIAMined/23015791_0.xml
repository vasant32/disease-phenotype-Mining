<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several medical and interventional therapies, such as atrial specific drugs and pulmonary vein isolation, have demonstrated prevention of recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their suboptimal long-term success and significant rate of secondary effects have led to intensive research in the last decade focused on novel alternative and supplemental therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One such candidate is <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (PUFAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of their biological properties, safety, simplicity, and relatively cheap cost, there is a special clinical interest in omega-3 PUFAs as a possible antiarrhythmic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Obtained from diets rich in fish, they represent one of the current supplemental therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, an increasing body of evidence has shown that n-3 PUFAs exert a variety of effects on cardiac ion channels, membrane dynamic properties, inflammatory cascade, and other targets related to AF prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the current basic and clinical evidence pertinent to n-3 PUFAs in AF treatment and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also discuss controversial outcomes among clinical studies and propose specific subsets of AF patients who will benefit most from n-3 PUFAs </plain></SENT>
