<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical Riata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead presumably because of increased risk of electric failure and mechanical separation via inside-out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the incidence and time dependence of inside-out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0580209,C1456154,C1302752" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">abrasion</z:e> in asymptomatic patients implanted with the Riata lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Asymptomatic patients implanted with the Riata lead at our institution were offered voluntary fluoroscopic screening in 3 views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electric testing of the Riata lead with provocative isometric muscle contraction was performed at the time of fluoroscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 245 patients undergoing fluoroscopic screening, 53 (21.6%) patients showed clear evidence of lead separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these externalized leads, 0%, 13%, and 26% had a dwell time of &lt;3 years, 3 to 5 years, and &gt;5 years, respectively (P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Externalized leads had a significantly pronounced decrease in R-wave amplitude (-1.7±2.9 mV versus +0.35±2.5 mV; P&lt;0.001), and more patients with externalized leads had ≥25% decrease in R-wave amplitude from baseline (28.0% versus 8.1%; P=0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with externalization exhibited new noise on near-field electrogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Riata lead exhibits time-dependent high rates of cable externalization exceeding 20% at &gt;5 years of dwell time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Externalized leads are associated with a more pronounced decrease in R-wave amplitude, which may be an early marker of future electric failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of fluoroscopic and electric screening of asymptomatic patients with the Riata lead remains controversial in the management of patients affected by the recent Food and Drug Administration recall </plain></SENT>
