<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized prospective study, 100 patients undergoing gastrectomy were assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (n=50) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> (n=50) anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No anticholinergic prophylaxis was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was defined as a sudden decrease in heart rate to &lt;50 beats/min, or a decrease to 50-59 beats/min if associated with a systolic arterial pressure of 70 mmHg in response to surgical manoeuvres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> developed, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> or ephedrine were administered according to a predefined treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 85 patients were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with symptomatic reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> groups was similar (69.0% versus 55.8%, respectively) and both groups required a similar amount of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> and/or ephedrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> occurred with a relatively high frequency during gastrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4445">desflurane</z:chebi> is associated with sympathetic activation, it did not provide a protective effect against vagally mediated reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> during gastrectomy compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
