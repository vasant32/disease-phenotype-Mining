<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the rate of abnormal TTM findings in transvenous versus epicardial PM systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our TTM database was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients younger than 21 years of age enrolled for TTM between 1990 and 2010 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormal TTM recordings (not including elective replacement indicator) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Note that P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 186 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 75 (40%) epicardial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at TTM enrollment was 6.8 Â± 5.9 years (2 months-20.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 41 (22%) patients with abnormal TTM findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were found in 23/75 (31%) epicardial and 18/111 (16%) transvenous systems (odds ratio [OR]: 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-4.62, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When controlling for age and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> the OR for abnormal transmission in epicardial systems compared with transvenous was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.03-4.43, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with epicardial systems were more likely to have capture abnormalities on TTM than transvenous systems (OR: 6.1, 95% CI: 1.9-19.5, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with epicardial PM systems are more likely to have abnormal TTM test (particularly capture problems) than patients with transvenous systems regardless of age or presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consequently, patients with epicardial PM systems should be followed closely with TTM </plain></SENT>
