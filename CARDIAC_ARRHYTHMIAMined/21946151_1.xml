<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">Local anesthetics</z:chebi> (LAs) are typically used for regional anesthesia but can be given systemically to mitigate postoperative pain, supplement general anesthesia, or prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, systemic application or inadvertent intravenous injection can be associated with substantial toxicity, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for this toxic action remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We characterized inhibition by different LAs of homomeric and heteromeric K channels containing TASK-1 (K2P3.1, KCNK3) and TASK-3 (K2P9.1, KCNK9) subunits in a mammalian expression system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used TASK-1/TASK-3 knockout mice to test the possibility that TASK channels contribute to LA-evoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LAs inhibited homomeric and heteromeric TASK channels in a range relevant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> induction; channels containing TASK-1 subunits were most sensitive and IC₅₀ values indicated a rank order potency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> &gt; ropivacaine &gt;&gt; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LAs induced tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in mice with the same rank order potency, but higher LA doses were required to evoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in TASK knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi>, which produced the longest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> times, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> duration was significantly shorter in TASK knockout mice; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were associated with an increase in electroencephalogram power at frequencies less than 5 Hz in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and TASK knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased neuronal excitability associated with TASK channel inhibition by LAs contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LAs were capable of evoking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in TASK channel deleted mice, albeit at higher doses, the results imply that other molecular targets must also be involved in this toxic action </plain></SENT>
