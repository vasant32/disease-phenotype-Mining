<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present an algorithm which processes RR interval time series in the time and frequency domain, identifying spectral peaks with characteristics consistent with fetal RSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tested on 50 data sets from the second and third trimester, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 96.1%, false positive rate 35.7%, false negative rate 3.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of automatically and visually identified episodes were very similar and corresponded the expected changes over gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method is suited for easy and reliable identification of fetal breathing movements </plain></SENT>
