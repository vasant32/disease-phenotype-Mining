<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the transition from sinus rhythm to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> happens by different mechanisms in different people, it is unrealistic to think that a single measure will be adequate to provide a good index for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyze the dynamical properties of ventricular premature complexes over 24â€‰h in an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to better understand the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> that occur in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two dimensional density plots, called heartprints, correlate characteristic features of the dynamics of premature ventricular complexes and the sinus rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heartprints show distinctive characteristics in individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on a better understanding of the natures of transitions from sinus rhythm to sudden cardiac and the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, it should be possible to develop better methods for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
