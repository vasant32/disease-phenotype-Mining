<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metrics are highly correlated, new findings illustrate that the metrics are noticeably different on the above dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one method conforms to the assumptions for parametric analyses, is not moderated by respiration, is not influenced by nonstationarity, and reliably generates stronger effect sizes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this method is also the most sensitive to vagal blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific features of this method may provide insights into improving the statistical characteristics of other commonly used RSA metrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide the evidence to question, based on statistical grounds, published reports using particular metrics of RSA </plain></SENT>
