<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left atrial reconstruction and mapping allowed the zone of the earliest atrial potential to be recorded; the entire course of the ablation catheter was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were successfully ablated; no thrombotic complications were observed </plain></SENT>
