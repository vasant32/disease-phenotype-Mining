<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> the patient was submitted to electrophysiological study revealing a re-entrant circuit at the level of the medium segment of interventricular septum, successfully treated with transcatheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case highlights how the presence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, suspected or proven, could be associated with a pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrate, therefore these patients should be submitted to electrophysiological study in order to rule out the presence of arrhythmogenic focuses that can be treated with transcatheter ablation </plain></SENT>
