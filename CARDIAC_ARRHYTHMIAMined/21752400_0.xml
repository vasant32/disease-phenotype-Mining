<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Coronary hypoperfusion contributes to higher left ventricular mass persistence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study compares 2 similarly sized aortic prostheses (mechanical and porcine) regarding coronary flow and hemodynamic performances in patients who underwent surgery for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients having undergone aortic valve replacement for pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> with Medtronic Mosaic Ultra bioprosthesis 21 mm (n = 30) or St Jude Regent mechanical valve 19 mm (n = 30) were evaluated preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively comparing the coronary flow and the hemodynamic behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography and cardiac <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography were performed at rest and during exercise or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> maximal stimulation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The St Jude Regent mechanical valve, compared with the Medtronic Mosaic Ultra bioprosthesis, had reduced coronary flow reserve (2.1 ± 0.3 vs 2.3 ± 0.2; P = .003), less favorable systolic/diastolic time ratio (0.87 ± 0.02 vs 0.78 ± 0.03; P &lt; .001), and higher mean transprosthetic gradient (46 ± 11 vs 38 ± 9; P = .003) during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of impaired coronary reserve related indexed effective orifice area less than 0.65 cm/m(2) (risk ratio [RR], 1.9; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.5-2.8; P &lt; .001), mechanical valve (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-3.3; P &lt; .001), and systolic/diastolic time ratio greater than 0.75 (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.8; P &lt; .001), as well as high transprosthetic gradient (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4; P &lt; .001) ) during exercise with coronary reserve less than 2.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of coronary flow and reserve was more evident for bioprostheses than for mechanical valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bioprostheses demonstrated superior hemodynamics during exercise, which may have some impact on exercise capability during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily life </plain></SENT>
