<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Observational studies identified increased age, left atrial (LA) size, type and duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) as independent predictors for failure of AF surgical ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rhythm at discharge following the Cox maze (CM) procedure for AF was never considered a significant predictor of success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were to: (i) Determine the association of sinus rhythm (SR) at discharge and maintenance of SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(ii) Identify the variables associated with discharge rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(iii) Identify the effects of discharge rhythm on health-related quality of life (HRQL) post-CM procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study (n = 534) of CM III/IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rhythm captured during hospitalization, discharge, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months and verified by electrocardiogram and 24-h holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent SR interventions were captured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression identified predictors of discharge rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HRQL (Short-Form 12; AF symptom frequency and Severity Checklist V3) obtained during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent were discharged in SR (n = 469) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LA size (OR = 1.36, CI: 1.02-1.82, P = 0.035) and long-standing AF type (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.31-5.50, P = 0.007) were the only independent predictors of non-SR at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lower rates of SR at 2 years were found in patients discharged in non-SR (75 vs 91%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients discharged in SR had fewer perioperative morbidities [prolonged ventilation &gt;24 h (6 vs 14%, P = 0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> requiring dialysis (0.9 vs 5%, 0.04) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (2 vs 9%, P = 0.005)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean = 43 Â± 27 months), patients discharged in SR had fewer cardioversions (15 vs 29%, P = 0.006), similar percutaneous catheter ablations (6 vs 5%, P = 1.00) and no difference in late embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.5 vs 1.1%, P = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort study, rhythm at discharge was found to be clinically significant with predicting SR at 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should be aware that the prognosis of non-SR patients at discharge remains excellent with high rates of SR at 24 months if managed appropriately using rhythm rather than rate control strategies </plain></SENT>
