<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> (DM) have an annual mortality of approximately 3.5%, one-third of which is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predictors of cardiac conduction disease in these patients are incompletely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single-center cohort study included 211 patients with DM type 1 (DM1) and 25 DM type 2 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A severe electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality was defined as a PR interval of ≥240 ms or QRS duration of ≥120 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> was found in 24% of DM1 patients and 17% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among DM1 patients, those with a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> were older (41.6 ± 14.6 vs 35.4 ± 12.6 years) and more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (13.2% vs 4.2%, P = 0.038), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (4.4% vs 0%, P = 0.056), atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (6.6% vs 0.7%, P &lt; 0.001), a higher number of trinucleotide repeats (689 ± 451 vs 474 ± 322, P = 0.01), and a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (26.7% vs 5.6%, P &lt; 0.001) or pacemaker implantation (20% vs 0.7%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pacemakers or defibrillators were implanted in 14% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, including 65% of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 57 ± 46 months, 13 patients died (1.16% per year), including three patients who died suddenly, two of whom had normally functioning pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In DM1, atrio-ventricular conduction disease is associated with increasing age, concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, nucleotide repeat length, and family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The systematic identification of conduction disease and aggressive use of prophylactic pacemakers is associated with low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
