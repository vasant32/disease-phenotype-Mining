<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated heart rate and prolonged ECG indices of conduction and repolarization have been associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insight into the genetic underpinnings of these parameters thus provides an important means to the dissection of the genetic components modulating risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) modulating heart rate, ECG indices of conduction and repolarization, and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, in a conduction disease-sensitized F(2) mouse population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, P-duration, PR-, QRS- and QT-interval were measured at baseline (n=502) and after flecainide administration (n=370) in mutant F(2) progeny (F(2)-MUT) resulting from the FVB/NJ-Scn5a1798(insD/+) X 129P2-Scn5a1798(insD/+) mouse cross </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Episodes of sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and ventricular tachyarrhythmia occurring post-flecainide were treated as binary traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>F(2)-MUT mice were genotyped using a genome-wide 768 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interval mapping uncovered multiple QTL for ECG parameters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A sex-interacting scan identified QTL displaying sex-dependency, and a two-dimensional QTL scan unmasked locus-locus (epistasis) interactions influencing ECG traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A number of QTL coincided at specific chromosomal locations, suggesting pleiotropic effects at these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Through transcript profiling in myocardium from the parental mouse strains we identified genes co-localizing at the identified QTL that constitute highly relevant candidates for the observed effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The detection of QTL influencing ECG indices and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is an essential step towards identifying genetic networks for sudden, arrhythmic, cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
