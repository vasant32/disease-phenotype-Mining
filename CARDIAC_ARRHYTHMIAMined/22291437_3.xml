<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of the present study was too explore the role of interatrial dyssynchrony in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: For the case study we selected seven patients with severe HFPEF, with interatrial block on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a delayed and interrupted A wave on mitral Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic left atrial (LA) volumes/functions, mitral E/A and E/e' ratios, mitral A wave duration/deceleration time, and interatrial mechanical delays (IAMDs) at tissue Doppler, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed right heart catheterization, and an electrophysiological study (EPS) for the measurement of interatrial conduction delay (IACD) and left atrioventricular interval (LAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean IAMD was 106 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients exhibited a restrictive mitral Doppler pattern, high E/A and E/e' ratios, and short A wave duration/deceleration time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial volume was increased, with severely depressed functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right heart catheterization showed severe post-capillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EPS showed an IACD of 170 ± 20 ms, with a short LAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left atrial pacing through the coronary sinus reduced the IACD to 25 ± 15 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the pilot study, 29 patients with HFPEF were compared with 27 age-matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HFPEF patients had longer P waves, shorter A waves, and a longer IAMD than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of severe IAMD &gt;60 ms was 59% in HFPEF and 0% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the HFPEF group, patients with an IAMD &gt;60 ms had significantly shorter A waves and higher E/e' ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Some HFPEF patients present with IACD, delayed LA systole, shortened LA emptying, decreased LA compliance, and increased filling pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Whether the condition of these patients could be improved by atrial resynchronization deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
