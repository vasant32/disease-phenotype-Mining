<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impaired HRT is of a significant prognostic value in humans after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far no studies were performed assessing the importance of HRT in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the HRT turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) and the turbulence slope (TS) in healthy dogs and in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> and to compare the HRT in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> that died during the first 30 days of observation and dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> that survived the first 30 days after the HRT analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current study was aimed at determining reference value of the TO and TS of HRT in healthy dogs (control group) and dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tests were carried out on 30 healthy dogs and 30 dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> composed of Boxers, Doberman pinschers and Great Danes, of different sexes and body weights from 22 to 72 kg, aged between 1.5 and 11.5 years, submitted to the 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HRT parameters were calculated using an HolCard software algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TO is a percentage difference between the heart rate immediately following ventricular premature complex (<z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp>) and the heart rate immediately preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>VPC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TS corresponds to the steepest slope of the linear regression line for each sequence of five consecutive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals in the local tachogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average TO in healthy dogs was determined as -13.55 +/- 11.12%, TS was 21.33 +/- 9.66 ms/RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TO in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> was determined as - 2.61 +/- 2.1% and TS was 6.15 +/- 3.86 ms/RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Parameters of HRT were statistically significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HRT TO and TS were statistically significantly decreased in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> that survived more than 30 days of observation had HRT statistically significantly decreased in comparison to dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> that died after the 30'th day of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Decreased HRT parameters in dogs with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> suggest an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> which principally consists of the withdrawal of the cardiac parasympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The more the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> is advanced the faster the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the dog with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> might occur, with no correlation with the level of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
