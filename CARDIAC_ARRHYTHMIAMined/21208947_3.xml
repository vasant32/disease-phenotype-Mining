<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on potential differences between both groups in mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy rates during long-term follow-up are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess differences in mortality and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy between secondary and primary prevention <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: With the exception of patients with congenital monogenetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, regardless of the underlying cardiac pathology, from 1996 to 2008 at the Leiden University Medical Center were included in the current analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study population was grouped by the type of prevention (secondary or primary) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of device therapy (appropriate or inappropriate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 2134 (80% men, mean age 63 ± 12 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1302 (61%) patients received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> for primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and 832 (39%) patients for secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 3.4 ± 2.8 years, 423 (20%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 25% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 21-29%] for primary prevention patients and 23% (95% CI: 20-26%) for secondary prevention patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secondary prevention patients exhibited a 74% increased risk for appropriate therapy when compared with primary prevention patients [hazard ratios (HR): 1.7; P&lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A comparable risk for inappropriate shocks was observed (HR: 1.0; P= 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During long-term follow-up, primary prevention patients exhibited a lower risk of appropriate therapy, but comparable mortality rates were observed between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both groups showed similar occurrence of inappropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
