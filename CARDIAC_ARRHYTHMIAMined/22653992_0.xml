<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study purpose was to examine whether the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> or sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (mito K(ATP) or sarc K(ATP), respectively) mediates exercise-induced cardioprotection against post-IR cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six, 4-mo-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to treadmill exercise (Ex; 30 m/min, 3 days, 60 min, ∼70 maximal oxygen uptake) and sedentary (Sed) treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were exposed to regional <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> (50 min) and reperfusion (120 min) or Sham (170 min; no ligation) surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise subgroups received placebo (saline), 5-hydroxydecanoate (5HD; 10 mg/kg ip), or HMR1098 (10 mg/kg ip) to inhibit mito K(ATP) or sarc K(ATP) channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive outcome assessments included post-IR ECG <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, cardiac tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, redox perturbations, and autophagy biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> differences existed between exercised and sedentary hearts following extended-duration IR (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sarc K(ATP) channel was confirmed essential (P = 0.002) for prevention of antinecrotic tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with exercise (percent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, Sed = 42%; Ex = 20%; Ex5HD = 16%; ExHMR = 42%), although neither the mito K(ATP) (P = 0.177) nor sarc K(ATP) (P = 0.274) channel provided post-IR protection against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxy <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15713">UTP</z:chebi>-mediated nick-end labeling-positive nuclei/mm(2), Sham = 1.8 ± 0.5; Sed = 19.4 ± 6.7; Ex = 7.5 ± 4.6; Ex5HD = 14.0 ± 3.9; ExHMR = 11.1 ± 1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exercise preconditioning also appears to preserve basal autophagy levels, as assessed by Beclin 1 (P ≤ 0.001), microtubule-associated protein-1 light-chain 3B ratios (P = 0.020), and P62 (P ≤ 0.001), in the hours immediately following IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to better understand these findings and corresponding redox changes in exercised hearts </plain></SENT>
