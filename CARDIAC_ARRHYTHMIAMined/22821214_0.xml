<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) may be a therapeutic adjunct for young patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) who are not fully protected by beta-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to report our institutional experience with LSCD in young patients for the management of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> and LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> and LQTS underwent transaxillary LSCD at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age at surgery was 14.0 (range 3.9-42) years, mean body weight was 45.7 (range 15.5-90) kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>, three were genotype positive for a mutation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi>-receptor-2-gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of five LQTS patients were genotype positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications for LCSD were recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> and/or internal cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) discharges, and aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> despite high doses of beta-blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCSD was performed via the transaxillary approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients already had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, 6 patients received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> at the same operation or shortly thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median length of follow-up after LCSD was 2.3 (range 0.6-3.9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After LCSD a marked reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden and cardiac events was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients while medication was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had any further <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> discharge for sustained VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After LCSD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden could significantly be reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> and LQTS </plain></SENT>
