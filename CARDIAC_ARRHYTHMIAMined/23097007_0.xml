<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PAF) is an effective treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Favourable outcomes at 6-12 months post-ablation have been reported using the multi-electrode catheter 'pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC)' but little is known about longer term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are also limited data on quality of life (QoL) post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation beyond 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred three consecutive patients (77 % male, mean age 57.7 ± 11 years) who had a PAF ablation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent conventional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) (n = 128) or PVAC ablation (n = 75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' symptoms were scored at baseline, at clinic follow-up and on questionnaire follow-up using the validated Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity of AF (CCS-SAF) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 'AF Effect on QualiTy of life' (AFEQT) questionnaire was used on questionnaire follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean questionnaire follow-up was 854 ± 176 days with 74 % response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (91.6 % overall) were highly symptomatic at baseline with CCS-SAF class 3 or 4 symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCS-SAF class on follow-up questionnaire decreased significantly from baseline for both groups (mean 1.69 ± 1.7 for PVAC and 1.45 ± 1.5 for PVI, p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) with no difference between groups (p = 0.52) and the majority being class 0 or 1 (59.9 % overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean AFEQT questionnaire scores were similar between both groups (78.1 ± 25 vs. 82 ± 23, p = 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Total procedure time was significantly shorter in the PVAC group (135 ± 54 vs. 178 ± 43 min, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was a comparable and significant improvement in QoL post-ablation in patients who underwent ablation using PVAC catheter and conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
