<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of elderly patients diagnosed with digitalis intoxication, on the Emergency Department, University Hospital Complex, A Coruña, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the study period (January-September 2008) cases were included in which digitalis intoxication was confirmed by plasma digoxin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We collected data on age, gender, base-line diseases, therapeutic indications for digoxin, functional classification, ejection fraction, plasma digoxin levels, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance, ions, gasometry, electrocardiogram, concomitant medication, symptomatology and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were: mean age 82.0 ± 6.6 years, predominantly female subjects (83.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent pathologies were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac valvulopathy</z:e> (81.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (68.3%) and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> (46.3%), 95.1% had a background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac insufficiency</z:hpo>, and 52.6% were in functional grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean digoxin level was 2.7 ± 0.69 ng/ml, 23.1% of the patients had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 2.6% had a severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (clearance&lt;30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was found between digoxin levels and clearance (r = -0.22; p = 0.18) and between the levels and cardiac frequency (r = -0.35; p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 47.5% presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and 87.8% <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, most frequently auricular <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (54.8%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (42.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (33.3%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo> (28.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that clinical digestive symptoms in elderly women who are taking digitalis, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and impaired renal functioning, should lead us to suspect digitalis intoxication </plain></SENT>
