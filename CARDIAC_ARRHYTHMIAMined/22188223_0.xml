<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-rays still serve as part of the routine assessment before elective surgery in many institutions, even though there is little evidence of their predictive value relating to perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the correlation of abnormal findings in pre-operative tests and pathologic findings in the medical history with perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients scheduled for elective surgery in a secondary care hospital were included in this prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal pre-operative tests, significant findings from the medical history and perioperative complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis was performed in order to identify the strongest predictors for perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1363 (56.1% female) patients were consecutively included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of abnormalities in pre-operative tests ranged from 1.6% (electrolytes) and 29.7% (echocardiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six (6.3%) patients had at least one perioperative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent complications were hypo- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 55 cases (4.0%), followed by 20 patients (1.5%) who suffered from hemodynamically relevant cardiac dysrhythmias such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The binary logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of perioperative complications showed significant results for age, invasiveness of the procedure, history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that age, type of surgery and medical history are appropriate predictors of perioperative complications, whereas abnormalities in laboratory tests seem to have restricted ability in predicting adverse perioperative outcome </plain></SENT>
