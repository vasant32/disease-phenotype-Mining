<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This anomaly and its hemodynamic effects is similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our two described cases, in which cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was, respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> by hanging, the cephalad portion of the left APM was inserted directly into the ventricular surface of the anterior mitral leaflet and chordae tendineae were absent in the area of the direct anomalous muscle insertion; the aberrant papillary muscle was very large and showed an exaggerated anterior displacement within the left ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The described anomaly is a cause of LVOT obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This condition is considered to be rare, although incidence estimates do not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the absence of other possible causes, this finding may indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as being the immediate cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
