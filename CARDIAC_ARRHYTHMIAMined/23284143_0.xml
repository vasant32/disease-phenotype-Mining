<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker implant in PLSVC can be technically challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most operators have hitherto manipulated ventricular leads through the coronary sinus (CS) into the right ventricle (RV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case series, we describe the use of standard passive tined ventricular leads implanted into the left ventricular (LV) epicardial veins in PLSVC.METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients with PLSVC underwent pacemaker implantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast injection in the dilated CS identified LV coronary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard passive tined pacing leads were manoeuvred into these branches using hand-shaped stylets without need for additional equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Atrial leads were actively fixed to the anterolateral right atrial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> ventricular capture threshold at 6 months of follow-up was 1.0 mV@ 0.4 ms.CONCLUSION: Implanting standard leads into the LV veins in PLSVC is safe, effective, and simple without the need for special tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is easier than manipulating leads into the RV in PLSVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer-term follow-up and dedicated clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach </plain></SENT>
