<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of commonly used beat-to-beat QT interval measurement algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different methods (conventional, template stretching and template time shifting) were subjected to simulated data featuring typical ECG recording issues (broadband noise, baseline wander, amplitude modulation) and real short-term ECG of patients before and after infusion of sotalol, a QT interval prolonging drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the three algorithms, the conventional algorithm was most susceptible to noise whereas the template time shifting algorithm showed superior overall performance on simulated and real ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the algorithms was able to detect increased beat-to-beat QT interval variability after sotalol infusion despite marked prolongation of the average QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QTV estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three algorithms were inversely correlated with the amplitude of the T wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, template matching algorithms, in particular the time shifting algorithm, are recommended for beat-to-beat variability measurement of QT interval in body surface ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recording noise, T wave amplitude and the beat-rejection strategy are important factors of QTV measurement and require further investigation </plain></SENT>
