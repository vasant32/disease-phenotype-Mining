<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disruption to the ventricular t-tubule network occurs in various cardiac pathologies and leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> changes of [Ca(2+)]i which are thought to contribute to the reduced contractility and increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> of the diseased ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we review evidence that, despite the long-held dogma of atrial cells having no or very few t-tubules, there is indeed an extensive and functionally significant t-tubule network present in atrial myocytes of large mammals including human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the atrial t-tubule network is highly plastic in nature and undergoes far more extensive remodelling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> than is the case in the ventricle with profound consequences for the resulting systolic Ca(2+) transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to considering the functional role of the t-tubule network in the healthy and diseased atria we also provide an overview of recent data concerning the putative factors controlling the formation of t-tubules and conclude by posing some important questions that currently remain to be addressed and whether or not targeting t-tubules offers potential novel therapeutic possibilities for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
