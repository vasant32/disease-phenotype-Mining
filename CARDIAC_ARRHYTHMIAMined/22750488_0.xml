<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tested antipsychotic drugs caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> of the rat embryonic heart in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, with the possible exception of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> the tested drugs did not cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> typically seen with the highly selective I(Kr)/hERG blocking drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For six of the eight drugs tested the effects on the embryonic rat heart were only seen at free drug concentrations that were much greater than those likely to occur in pregnant women taking antipsychotic medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the safety margins for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8707">quetiapine</z:chebi> were lower </plain></SENT>
