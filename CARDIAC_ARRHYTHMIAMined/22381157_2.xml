<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the usefulness of perioperative NT-proBNP and ACE-2 for predicting cardiac events after emergency orthopedic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The perioperative NT-proBNP and ACE-2 levels were determined in 187 consecutive patients aged &gt;60 years who underwent orthopedic surgery with 1 year of follow-up for any cardiac complications (defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 187 patients, 20 (10.7%) sustained an in-hospital postoperative cardiac complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause in-hospital and 1-year mortality rate was 1.6% (3 of 187) and 8.6% (16 of 187), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median preoperative and postoperative NT-proBNP level was greater in patients who sustained an in-hospital cardiac event than in those who had not (386 vs 2,273 pg/ml, p &lt;0.001, and 605 vs 4,316 pg/ml, p &lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the postoperative median ACE-2 levels were significantly greater in the patients with an in-hospital cardiac event than in those without (25.3 vs 39.5 pmol/ml/min, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A preoperative NT-proBNP level of â‰¥741 pg/ml (odds ratio 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 15.2, p = 0.017), postoperative troponin elevation (odds ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 18.9, p = 0.022), and number of co-morbidities (odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8, p = 0.009) independently predicted in-hospital cardiac complications on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pre- and postoperative NT-proBNP level independently predicted 1-year cardiovascular complications but not the ACE-2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevated perioperative NT-proBNP predicted in-hospital and 1-year cardiac events in an emergency orthopedic population but the ACE-2 levels did not, which requires additional study for validation </plain></SENT>
