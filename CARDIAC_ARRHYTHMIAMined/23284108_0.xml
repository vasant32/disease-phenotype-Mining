<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: data of 101 patients (mean age, 63.86 years; age range, 30-85 years; 92% male), operated on with stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30% between April 2000 and June 2010, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: operative mortality was 1.9% (2/101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from 25.99% ± 3.8% preoperatively to 34% ± 12% postoperatively (p &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 56.3 ± 33 months, and it was 97% complete (98/101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 18/96 (18.75%) late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall actuarial survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 96%, 89%, 83% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, and logistic EuroSCORE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were cerebrovascular disease and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: our study suggests that myocardial revascularization for ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> improves left ventricular ejection fraction and is associated with favorable long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with cerebrovascular disease and preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> had poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
