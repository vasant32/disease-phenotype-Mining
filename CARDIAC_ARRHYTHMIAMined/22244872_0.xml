<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The unintended block of hERG channels by compounds can prolong the cardiac action potential duration and induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several compounds not only block hERG channels but also enhance channel activation after the application of a depolarizing voltage step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is referred to as facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tried to extract the property of compounds that induce hERG channel facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We first examined the facilitation effects of structurally diverse hERG channel blockers in Xenopus oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of 13 assayed compounds allowed facilitation, suggesting that it is an effect common to most hERG channel blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We constructed a pharmacophore model for hERG channel facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The model consisted of one positively ionizable feature and three hydrophobic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Verification experiments suggest that the model well describes the structure-activity relationship for facilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the pharmacophore for facilitation with that for hERG channel block showed that the spatial arrangement of features is clearly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is therefore conceivable that two different interactions of a compound with hERG channels exert two pharmacological effects, block and facilitation </plain></SENT>
