<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case one: a 49 year-old woman with post <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> extrasytoles (34 000/24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ectopic focus was located on the tricuspid annulus - directly in the area of largest and sharpest His bundle potential and where direct His bundle capture was observed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pace mapping attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case two: a 15 year- -old men with idiopathic, very frequent premature ventricular beats from septal aspect of the mitral annulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area of earliest activation during the spontaneous ectopy with 12/12 pace map match showed obvious His bundle potential, moreover, the radiofrequency ablation catheter was unstable in that position (inferoseptal from retrograde aortic approach) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases treatment with cryoablation was successfully and uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, cryoablation instead of radiofrequency current ablation should be used for ventricular ectopy from septal part of the tricuspid or mitral annuli especially in cases of parahisian localisation and/or catheter instability </plain></SENT>
