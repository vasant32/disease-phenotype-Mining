<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As part of the regulatory requirements for drug approval, the potential of novel compounds for causing unwanted proarrhythmia should be studied in a thoroughly designed clinical QT/corrected QT (QTc) study (International Conference on Harmonisation [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>] E14 guideline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to evaluate whether nalmefene 20 and 80 mg/day induced changes in cardiac repolarization biomarkers indicative of proarrhythmia (the QTc interval and T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled, single-centre study carried out in a clinical pharmacology unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 270 healthy male and female subjects (age 18-45 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subjects were randomized to a 7-day treatment period of placebo, nalmefene 20 mg/day or nalmefene 80 mg/day, or placebo for 6 days followed by a single dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial triplicate ECGs were obtained over a 24-hour period at protocol-defined time-points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary protocol-defined endpoint was the largest time-matched baseline- and placebo-adjusted mean difference in the individually heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcNi) recorded at any of the 12 ECG time-points distributed over a 24-hour period on day 7 of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included a similar analysis using the Fridericia- (QTcF) and Bazett-corrected (QTcB) intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An explorative analysis included quantitative assessment of T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> using the T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> composite score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e>) to assess for differences between treatment groups and placebo on day 7 of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of outliers in the QTc intervals, the pharmacokinetics of nalmefene and the tolerability of nalmefene were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nalmefene was rapidly absorbed with a time to reach maximum plasma concentration of 2.2 hours and a dose-proportionate relationship between dose administered and exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The largest baseline- and placebo-adjusted mean changes from baseline in the individualized QTcNi (primary endpoint) were 5.45 ms (90% CI 1.52, 9.37) and 5.57 ms (90% CI 1.62, 9.52) for nalmefene 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively, with study sensitivity confirmed by the expected largest increase in mean QTcNi of 10.15 ms (90% CI 5.67, 14.63) for moxifloxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quantitative assessment using the T-wave <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> demonstrated the largest baseline- and placebo-adjusted increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCS</z:e> to be non-significantly different from the intra-subject variability of triplicate recordings in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or serious adverse events occurred in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This thorough QT/QTc study was a negative study in accordance with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> E14 guideline, meaning that nalmefene has no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval and T-wave <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The study predicts no concern over proarrhythmia or need for intensive QTc monitoring with the use of nalmefene in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
