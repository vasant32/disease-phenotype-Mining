<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of the hERG function by mutations or a wide variety of pharmaceutical compounds cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and lead to potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For detailed insights into the structural and biochemical background of hERG function and drug binding, the purification of recombinant protein is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the hERG channel is a challenging protein to purify, fast and easy techniques to evaluate different expression, solubilization and purification conditions are of primary importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the generation of a set of 12 monoclonal antibodies against hERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beside their suitability in western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining, these antibodies were used to establish a sandwich ELISA for the detection and relative quantification of hERG in different expression systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a Fab fragment was used in fluorescence size exclusion chromatography to determine the oligomeric state of hERG after solubilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These new tools can be used for a fast and efficient screening of expression, solubilization and purification conditions </plain></SENT>
