<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite low potential toxicity of this <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicide</z:chebi>, a number of fatalities and severe outcomes are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, some authors have described the clinical features associated with blood and urine concentrations following intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical feature and determinate the utility of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27744">glyphosate</z:chebi> concentration in blood and urine and the dose taken for predicting clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 13 glyphosate poisoning cases treated in our laboratory within 7 years period from 2002 to 2009, we registered clinical observations and collected blood and urine samples to HPLC-MS-MS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We classified our patients by the intoxication severity using simple clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We obtained clinical observations from 10 patients and the others three patients were treated in forensic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 patients, one was asymptomatic, 5 had mild to moderate poisoning and 2 had severe poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> whose 3 were forensic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were oropharyngeal ulceration (5/10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> (3/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main altered biological parameters were high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (3/10) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> (7/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also noted <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> (3/10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (4/10), hyperkaleamia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>impaired renal function</z:hpo> (2/10), hepatic toxicity (1/10) and altered consciousness (3/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In fatalities, the common symptoms were cardiovascular shock, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo>, haemodynamic disturbance, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="D.I.C.">intravascular disseminated coagulation</z:e> and multiple organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27744">glyphosate</z:chebi> concentrations had a mean value of 61 mg/L (range 0.6-150 mg/L) and 4146 mg/L (range 690-7480 mg/L) respectively in mild-moderate intoxication and fatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the severe intoxication case for which blood has been sampled, the blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27744">glyphosate</z:chebi> concentration was found at 838 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was most of the time associated with larger taken dose (500 mL in one patient) and high blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27744">glyphosate</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To predict clinical outcomes and to guide treatment support in patients who ingested <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27744">glyphosate</z:chebi>, blood concentrations of this compound and the taken dose have been useful </plain></SENT>
