<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, point-by-point circumferential ablation was performed to achieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> electrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation with an incomplete circumferential ablation line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, the impact of this intentional 'visual gap' (ViG) on the conduction properties of the ablation lesion set was assessed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and pacing manoeuvres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal (n= 20) or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (n= 8) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) ablation was performed around ipsilateral vein pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> isolation was achieved, ablation was halted and the presence and size of the ViG were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ViG electrophysiological properties were tested with pace capture along the ViG at 10 mA/2 ms, and assessment for dormant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> conduction with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite electrical isolation, a ViG was present in 75% (n= 42/56) of vein pairs (21 of 28 left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> and 21 of 28 right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the ViG size between the left and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> (22.1 ± 14.2 and 17.3 ± 11.3 mm, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dormant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> connections were revealed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> in more than a quarter (n= 12/42) of acutely isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> pairs, of which the majority were dependent on conduction through the ViG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation can usually be achieved without complete circumferential ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, more than a quarter of these 'isolated' <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> exhibit dormant conduction-predominantly via the un-ablated 'ViGs' in the ablation lesion set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that reversible tissue injury contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation that may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> but not necessarily durable </plain></SENT>
