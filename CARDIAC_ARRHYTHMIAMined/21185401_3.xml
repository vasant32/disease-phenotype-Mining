<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of CRT on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important among patients with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> is a leading cause of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to assess the impact of CRT on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in mild HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic left vEntricular dysfunction (REVERSE) study is a multicenter randomized, double-blind trial of CRT among patients with mild systolic HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time to first appropriate, treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) episode or spontaneous sustained VT in cardiac resynchronization therapy plus defibrillation device (CRT-D) patients was compared between groups, as were predictors of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study randomized 508 patients who received CRT-D devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant demographic differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes or VT storm between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, in the CRT ON group, the estimated event rate was 18.7% at 2 years, compared with 21.9% in the CRT OFF group (hazard ratio 1.05, P = .84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, among CRT ON patients, those with reverse remodeling had a reduced incidence of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> compared with those without remodeling (5.6% vs. 16.3%, hazard ratio 0.31, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CRT for up to 2 years does not impact VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in mild HF despite marked clinical and remodeling effects of pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This neutral effect may be attributable to competing antiarrhythmic effects of reverse remodeling and proarrhythmic effect of pacing </plain></SENT>
