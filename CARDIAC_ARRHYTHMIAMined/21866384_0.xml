<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies indicate that intramyocardial injection of autologous cells to augment contractile function may modify the arrhythmogenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of epicardial injections of autologous dermal fibroblasts in infarcted pigs on the incidence of spontaneous and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight pigs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was induced, and the skin was excised for fibroblast isolation, culture, and labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 weeks, animals received epicardial injection of the autologous fibroblasts (n = 4) or saline (n = 4) across the scarred and border zone regions, with continuous ECG monitoring for the following 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiologic study with programmed stimulation was performed before injections and at sacrifice, and histological analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG monitoring showed that the fibroblast group had a lower total number of ectopic ventricular complexes per day when compared to the control group (58 ± 119 versus 478 ± 1,308 respectively; p = 0.013) and fewer episodes of non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> per day (0 episodes versus 31 ± 148 respectively; p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inducibility during programmed ventricular stimulation was no different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis disclosed the presence of viable BrdU-labeled cells in injected areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study showed that fibroblasts can be safely transplanted in an infarcted heart and survive for at least 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast injection did not increase the inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and reduced the incidence of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
