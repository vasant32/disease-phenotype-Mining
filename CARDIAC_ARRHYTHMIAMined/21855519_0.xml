<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Short QT syndrome is one of the underlying disorders associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the precise prognostic implication of a short QT interval remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and long-term prognosis in patients with a shorter-than-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QT interval in a large hospital-based population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We chose patients with a short Bazett QTc interval from a database consisting of 114,334 patients to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of a short QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 427 patients (mean age 43.4 ± 22.4 years) had a short QT interval with about a 1.2 times higher male predominance (234 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QTc interval was significantly longer in female than in male patients (363.8 ± 6.1 ms vs 357.1 ± 5.8 ms, P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-specific prevalence of patients with short QT interval was biphasic, peaking at young and old age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and early repolarization were complicated with short QT interval in 39 (9.1%) and 26 (6.1%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of 327 patients (182 men; mean age, 46.4 ± 27.3 years) with a short QT interval could be assessed (mean follow-up period, 54.0 ± 62.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 2 patients, 1 of whom had early repolarization, developed life-threatening events, in contrast to 6 patients who died of noncardiac causes and did not have early repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of a short QT interval showed a slight male preponderance and biphasic age-dependent distribution in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complication rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was higher in those with a short QT interval than in general populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcome suggested that early repolarization in a short QT interval might be associated with potential risk of lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
