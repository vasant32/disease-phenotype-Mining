<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced ROS release (RIRR) is a fundamental mechanism by which cardiac mitochondria respond to elevated ROS levels by stimulating endogenous ROS production in a regenerative, autocatalytic process that ultimately results in global <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (OS), cellular dysfunction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite elegant studies describing the phenomenon of RIRR under artificial conditions such as photo-induced oxidation of discrete regions within cardiomyocytes, the existence, biophysical properties and functional consequences of RIRR in intact myocardium remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we used a semi-quantitative approach of optical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-)) mapping using dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence to explore RIRR, its arrhythmic consequences and underlying mechanisms in intact myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, perfusion of rat hearts with 200 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> for 40 min (n = 4) elicited two distinct <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) peaks that were readily distinguished by their timing and amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first peak (P1), which was generated rapidly (within 5-8 min of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> perfusion) was associated with a relatively limited (10 ± 2%) rise in normalized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) levels relative to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the second peak (P2) occurred 19-26 min following <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> perfusion and was associated with a significantly greater amplitude compared to P1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spatio-temporal ROS mapping during P2 revealed active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) propagation across the myocardium at a velocity of ~20 μm s(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of hearts (n = 18) to a short (10 min) episode of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> perfusion revealed consistent generation of P2 by high (≥200 μM, 8/8) but not lower (≤100 μM, 3/8) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these hearts, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of P2 occurred following, not during, the 10 min OS protocol, consistent with RIRR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, P2 (+) hearts exhibited a markedly greater (by 3.8-fold, P &lt; 0.001) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score compared to P2 (-) hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To explore the mechanism underlying RIRR in intact myocardium, hearts were perfused with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) or 4-chlorodiazepam (4-Cl-DZP) to inhibit the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition pore (mPTP) or the inner membrane <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> channel (IMAC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, perfusion with CsA failed to suppress (P = 0.75, n.s.) or even delay <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-induced P2 or the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared to untreated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, perfusion with 4-Cl-DZP markedly blunted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) levels during P2, and suppressed the incidence of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, perfusion of hearts with the synthetic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 completely abolished the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-mediated RIRR response as well as the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings extend the concept of RIRR to the level of the intact heart, establish regenerative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>(-) production as the mediator of RIRR-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reveal their strong dependence on IMAC and not the mPTP in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> model of OS </plain></SENT>
