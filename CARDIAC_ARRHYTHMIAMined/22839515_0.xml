<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our work is to describe the CBA technique and to report its short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBA was performed in 12 patients (8 men; age 53.1+/-5.7 years) with highly symptomatic drug-refractory AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paroxysmal AF was present in 11 and persistent AF - in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBA procedure was carried out under general anesthesia with intubation in 6 and under light sedation in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transseptal access and direct <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> angiography, 28 mm-cryoballoon was introduced into the left atrium, and more or equal 2 cryoapplications were delivered to each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, once good <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> occlusion was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation was verified utilizing a circular mapping catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences were monitored every 3 months after ablation using 24-hour Holter, and additional ECG registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring was also performed in a case of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete electrical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation was achieved by only cryoballoon ablation in 11 patients, and additional cryocatheter touch-up ablation was required in left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total procedure time was 203.1+/-34.2 min, fluoroscopy time - 50.5+/-14.0 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 136.8+/-59.8 days 9 (75%) patients were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence after a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Redo ablation was required in 1 patient, in whom electrical reconnection to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CBA is a novel promising technique for treatment of patients with AF, and now is available in Russian Federation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The method standardizes and facilitates interventional AF treatment with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> isolation of 96% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The short-term follow-up shows freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias in 75% of patients </plain></SENT>
