<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used latent growth curve modeling to explore adaptive patterns of dynamic RSA change in response to anger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Greater change in RSA during anger-induction, characterized by more initial RSA suppression and a subsequent return to baseline, was related to children's better regulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For anger-themed materials, low levels of authoritarian parenting predicted more RSA suppression and recovery for more anger-prone children, whereas more authoritative parenting predicted more RSA suppression and recovery for less anger-prone children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that children's adaptive patterns of dynamic RSA change can be characterized by latent growth curve modeling, and that these patterns may be differentially shaped by parent socialization experiences as a function of child temperament </plain></SENT>
