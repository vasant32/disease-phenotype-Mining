<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibition of human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels has been recognized as the main mechanism for QT prolongation (Cardiovasc Res 58:32-45, 2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mechanism has been demonstrated for a variety of small-molecule agents, which access the inner pore of the hERG channel preferentially from inside the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> inhibitors of hERG, such as BeKm-1, interact with the extracellular amino acid residues close to the external pore region of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the isolated rabbit heart was used to assess whether BeKm-1 could induce QTc prolongation like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> and N-[4-[[1-[2-(6-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51635">pyridinyl</z:chebi>)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>]methanesulfonamide (E-4031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five hearts were perfused with 10 and 100 nM BeKm-1 sequentially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG parameters and left ventricular contractility were measured with spontaneously beating hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both concentrations of BeKm-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc intervals</z:hpo> significantly and concentration-dependently (4.7 and 16.3% at 10 and 100 nM, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When evaluated for their inhibitory effect in a hERG functional assay, BeKm-1, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>, and E-4031 caused QTc prolongation at concentrations that caused significant hERG channel inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, two polyclonal anti-hERG antibodies were also assessed in the hERG channel assay and found to be devoid of any inhibitory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the isolated rabbit heart assay can be used to measure QTc changes caused by specific hERG inhibition by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that specifically block the external pore region of the channel </plain></SENT>
