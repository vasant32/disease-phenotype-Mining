<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> do not definitively indicate therapy failure over the long term, this period is also referred to as the 'blanking' or 'therapy stabilization' period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, early recurrences have been linked to the occurrence of late recurrences after catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies aiming at these early recurrences range from conservative management to repeat catheter ablation with controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we evaluate a recent publication investigating the efficacy of an aggressive rhythm control approach, with the use of prompt electrical cardioversion for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences on long-term outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation, and discuss the results in the light of current evidence </plain></SENT>
