<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, sustained insults such as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, hemodynamic overload, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> lead to dysfunctional NOS activity with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> produced instead of NO and worse pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RECENT ADVANCES: Major strides in understanding the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal constitutive NOS in the heart have revealed molecular targets by which NO modulates myocyte function and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, the role and nature of post-translational modifications of NOS, and factors controlling <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Localized and differential signaling from NOS1 (neuronal) versus NOS3 (endothelial) isoforms are being identified, as are methods to restore NOS function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRITICAL ISSUES: Abnormal NOS signaling plays a key role in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e>, while targeted modulation may potentially reverse this pathogenic source of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Improvements in the clinical translation of potent modulators of NOS function/dysfunction may ultimately provide a powerful new treatment for many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hearts diseases</z:e> that are fueled by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-redox imbalance </plain></SENT>
