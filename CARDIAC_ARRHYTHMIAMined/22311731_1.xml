<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two months after <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>, trains of 30 stimuli (burst pacing) performed following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> injection (0.2 mg/kg, ip), induced VT in 50% of the <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>-Ctr and in none of the <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>-DT mice (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
