<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to examine the contemporary epidemiology and autopsy characteristics of SCD in an ethnically diverse community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three physicians reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of individuals aged â‰¥20 years reported to the San Francisco medical examiner in 2007 for presentations fitting World Health Organization (WHO) SCD criteria-within 1 hour of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (witnessed) or within 24 hours of being observed alive and symptom free (unwitnessed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After comprehensive review of medical examiner investigation, WHO SCDs were classified as sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (SAD) or nonarrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and cardiac mass were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SADs undergoing autopsy and compared with demographically similar accidental trauma control <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 252 WHO SCDs; 145 were SADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men had a 2.2-fold higher SAD rate (P &lt; .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blacks had a 3.15-fold higher SAD rate compared with whites (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant CAD was present in 38.9% of SADs and associated with higher SAD risk compared with control <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.12-5.97, P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean cardiac mass was linearly associated with risk for SAD in cases without significant CAD (OR 2.06 per 100 g, 95% CI 1.43-2.98, P &lt; .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse, urban population, SAD incidence varied substantially by gender and race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant CAD accounted for far fewer SADs than previous studies but remained associated with a 2.6-fold higher risk as compared with control <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings may reflect the evolving contemporary epidemiology of SCD </plain></SENT>
