<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of HDACIs on the functional expression of cardiac gap junctions (GJs) are essentially unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) and vorinostat (VOR) on functional GJ expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of HDAC inhibition on connexin43 (Cx43) expression and functional GJ assembly were examined in primary cultured neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TSA and VOR reduced Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, protein expression, and immunolocalized Cx43 GJ plaque area within ventricular myocyte monolayer cultures in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed altered protein interactions with the Cx43 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VOR also altered the phosphorylation state of several key regulatory Cx43 phospho-serine sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp analysis revealed reduced electrical coupling between isolated ventricular myocyte pairs, altered transjunctional voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics, and steady state junctional conductance inactivation and recovery relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single GJ channel conductance was reduced to 54 pS only by maximum inhibitory doses of TSA (â‰¥ 100 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two hydroxamate pan-HDACIs exert multiple levels of regulation on ventricular GJ communication by altering Cx43 expression, GJ area, post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation), gating, and channel conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although a 50% downregulation of Cx43 GJ communication alone may not be sufficient to slow ventricular conduction or induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the development of class-selective HDACIs may help avoid the potential negative cardiovascular effects of pan-HDACI </plain></SENT>
