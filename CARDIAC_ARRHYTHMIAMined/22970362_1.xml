<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is able to regulate various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to examine if NOS3(-/-) myocytes had altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APs, transient outward (I(to)), sustained (I(Ksus)), and inward rectifier (I(K1)) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents were measured in NOS3(-/-) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During β-AR stimulation, AP duration (measured as 90% repolarization-APD(90)) was prolonged in NOS3(-/-) compared to WT myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we did not observe differences in I(to), I(Ksus), or I(K1) between WT and NOS3(-/-) myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our previous work showed that NOS3(-/-) myocytes had a greater Ca(2+) influx via L-type Ca(2+) channels with β-AR stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we measured β-AR-stimulated SR Ca(2+) load and found a greater increase in NOS3(-/-) versus WT myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, our data suggest that the prolonged AP in NOS3(-/-) myocytes is not due to changes in I(to), I(Ksus), or I(K1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in spontaneous activity in NOS3(-/-) myocytes may be due to a greater increase in SR Ca(2+) load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are increased and NOS3 expression is decreased </plain></SENT>
