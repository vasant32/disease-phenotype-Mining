<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This association may be of particular importance in differential diagnosis, since authors have reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanism of these ECG changes has remained unclear to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a few reports have been published on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>-induced QT prolongation and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case report describes the case history of a young female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> accompanied with a substantial prolongation of the QT interval, resulting in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A thorough cardiologic work-up (including coronary angiography and electrophysiology screen) ruled out other causes of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, the QT interval normalized and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> has not recurred during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the best knowledge of the authors, there is no case reports in the literature similar to that described in this paper </plain></SENT>
