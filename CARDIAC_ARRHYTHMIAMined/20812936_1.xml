<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone has been thought to be insufficient in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (PersAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that preablation treatment of PersAF with a potent antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) would facilitate reverse atrial remodeling and result in high procedural efficacy after PVI alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-one consecutive patients (59.4 ± 9.8 years) with PersAF and prior AAD failure were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> (768 ± 291 mcg/day) for a median of 85 days pre-PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-wave duration (Pdur) on ECG was used to assess reverse atrial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with paroxysmal (P) AF not treated with an AAD served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent PVI alone; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> was discontinued 1-3 mos postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the PersAF patients, the Pdur decreased from 136.3 ± 21.7 ms (assessed postcardioversion on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>) to 118.6 ± 20.4 ms (assessed immediately prior to PVI) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no change in Pdur (122.6 ± 11.5 ms vs. 121.3 ± 13.7 ms, P = NS) was observed in PAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 6 and 12 mos AAD-free response to ablation was 76% and 70%, respectively, in PersAF patients, similar to the 80% and 75%, response in PAF patients (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decline in Pdur in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> was the only predictor of long-term clinical response to PVI in patients with PersAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment with AAD resulted in a decrease in Pdur suggesting reverse atrial electrical remodeling in PersAF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may explain the excellent clinical outcomes using PVI alone, and may suggest an alternative ablation strategy for PersAF </plain></SENT>
