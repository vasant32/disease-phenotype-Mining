<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scar can be detected by delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of pre-procedural scar identification and intraprocedural real-time image registration with an electroanatomical map in 23 patients with previous infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Registration accuracy and cardiac magnetic resonance/electroanatomical map correlations were assessed, and critical areas for VA were correlated with the presence of scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a positional registration error of 3.8 Â± 0.8 mm, 86% of low-voltage points of the electroanatomical map projected onto the registered scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance-defined scar correlated with the area of low voltage (R = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sites critical to VAs projected on the registered scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selective identification and extraction of delayed-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance defined scar followed by registration into a real-time mapping system are feasible and help to identify and display the arrhythmogenic substrate in post-infarction patients with VAs </plain></SENT>
