<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activation can provoke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> mediated by cAMP-dependent alterations of Ca(2+) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, cAMP can activate both protein kinase A and an exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), but their functional interaction is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In heart, selective Epac activation can induce potentially arrhythmogenic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release that involves Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) effects on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested whether physiological β-AR activation causes Epac-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and whether it requires Epac1 versus Epac2, β(1)-AR versus β(2)-AR, and CaMKIIδ-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2-S2814 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used knockout (KO) mice for Epac1, Epac2, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> KOs exhibited unaltered basal cardiac function, Ca(2+) handling, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in response to pressure overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, SR Ca(2+) leak induced by the specific Epac activator 8-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was abolished in Epac2-KO and double-KO mice but was unaltered in Epac1-KO mice. β-AR-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were also less inducible in Epac2-KO versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice. β-AR activation with protein kinase A inhibition mimicked 8-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> effects on SR Ca(2+) leak and was prevented by blockade of β(1)-AR but not β(2)-AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibition (KN93) and genetic ablation of either CaMKIIδ or CaMKII phosphorylation on RyR2-S2814 prevented 8-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-induced SR Ca(2+) leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: β(1)-AR activates Epac2 to induce SR Ca(2+) leak via CaMKIIδ-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2-S2814 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pathway contributes to β-AR-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and reduced cardiac function </plain></SENT>
