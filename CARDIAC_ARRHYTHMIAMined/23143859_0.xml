<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate CRT mid-term effects on LV-arterial coupling, arterial load and its determinants, and the association between CRT-dependent aortic haemodynamic changes and the arterial biomechanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac and aortic echographies were done in 25 patients (age: 61 ± 12 years; 14 men; New York Heart Association functional classes III-IV; LV ejection fraction = 28 ± 7%, QRS = 139 ± 20 ms) before and after (23 ± 12 days) CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard structural and functional parameters and dyssynchrony indices were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ascending aorta flow and diameter waveforms were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Central pressure was derived using a transfer function and the diameter calibration method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Calculus: arterial elastance (EA); aortic impedance (Zc) and distensibility (AD); systemic resistances (SVR), total compliance (CT); global reflection coefficient; LV end-systolic elastance (EES); and LV-arterial coupling (EA/EES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After CRT EA diminished (-30%;P = 0.001), EES increased (29%; P = 0.001) and EA/EES improved (pre-CRT: 2.9 ± 0.9, post-CRT: 1.6 ± 0.7; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial elastance changes were associated with changes in arterial properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization therapy was associated with pressure-independent increase in mean aortic diameter (pre-CRT: 30.0 ± 4.0 mm, post-CRT: 33.0 ± 5.1 mm; P = 0.005) and distensibility (pre-CRT: 3.8 ± 2.6 × 10(-3)mmHg(-1), post-CRT: 6.4 ± 2.5 × 10(-3) mmHg(-1); P = 0.002), and Zc reduction (pre-CRT: 3.5 ± 1.8 × 10(-2)mmHg.s/mL, post-CRT:1.9 ± 0.8 × 10(-2) mmHg.s/mL; P = 0.001) and SVR (pre-CRT:1.7 ± 0.4 mmHg.s/mL, post-CRT:1.0 ± 0.3 mmHg.s/mL; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in EA determinants were associated with changes in aortic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early after CRT central and peripheral arterial biomechanics improved, determining a pressure-independent increase in aortic diameter and a reduction in arterial load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic performance and LV-arterial coupling were enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Arterial biomechanical changes were associated with aortic flow changes </plain></SENT>
