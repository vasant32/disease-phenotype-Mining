<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the influence of mating behavior on cardiac function, changes in heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), hematocrit (Hct) and serum concentration of alpha-atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (alpha-ANP) were evaluated in 10 clinically sound Thoroughbred stallions before and after mating behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stallions were submitted twice to experimental pseudomating in the same month in 2009 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements and blood samples were collected at a stable before mating (baseline) and at a covering yard before and after mating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG was recorded by a Holter-ECG system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected in 5 stallions before or after mating behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minimum HR (HRmin), maximum HR (HRmax) and HR recorded when the stallions entered into yard (HRent) and ejaculated (HRejc) were 34.2 ± 3.7, 168.9 ± 14.2, 141.8 ± 35.3 and 142.6 ± 27.3 beats/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Time from entrance into the yard to ejaculation (mating time; MT) ranged from 30 to 2,103 sec and was highly correlated with HRent (r=-0.82) and the time required for attaining HRmax after entrance into the yard (dT HRmax) (r=0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hct and serum alpha-ANP concentration significantly increased after ejaculation (60.0 ± 3.2%, P&lt;0.0001, and 1.54 ± 0.61 ng/ml, P=0.0353) compared with the baselines values (46.9 ± 4.4%, 1.40 ± 0.60 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HRent and Hct were significantly higher in the stallions with an MT of less than 5 min (n=5) compared with those (n=5) with an MT of more than 5 min (P=0.0324 and P=0.0082) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mating behavior increases the workload of the heart in Thoroughbred stallions </plain></SENT>
