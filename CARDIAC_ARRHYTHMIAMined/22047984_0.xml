<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence suggests that the changes of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> levels and gender differences may affect ventricular repolarization and be associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies showed that the level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> in the IOTVA male patients decreased significantly and the count of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly negatively correlated with the level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> in male patients with IOTVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy could inhibit significantly the count of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the postmenopausal patients with IOTVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy may be a potential therapeutic approach for IOTVA besides postmenopausal patients </plain></SENT>
