<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data comparing radiofrequency catheter ablation with antiarrhythmic drug therapy as first-line treatment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomly assigned 294 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and no history of antiarrhythmic drug use to an initial treatment strategy of either radiofrequency catheter ablation (146 patients) or therapy with class IC or class III antiarrhythmic agents (148 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up included 7-day Holter-monitor recording at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were the cumulative and per-visit burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (i.e., percentage of time in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> on Holter-monitor recordings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the ablation and drug-therapy groups in the cumulative burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (90th percentile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> burden, 13% and 19%, respectively; P=0.10) or the burden at 3, 6, 12, or 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly lower in the ablation group than in the drug-therapy group (90th percentile, 9% vs. 18%; P=0.007), and more patients in the ablation group were free from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (85% vs. 71%, P=0.004) and from symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (93% vs. 84%, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ablation group was due to a procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; there were three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> in the ablation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the drug-therapy group, 54 patients (36%) underwent supplementary ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In comparing radiofrequency ablation with antiarrhythmic drug therapy as first-line treatment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, we found no significant difference between the treatment groups in the cumulative burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> over a period of 2 years </plain></SENT>
