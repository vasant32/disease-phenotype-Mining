<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate rates and identify predictors of inpatient complications and 30-day readmissions, as well as repeat hospitalization rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: AF is the most common clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency or cryotherapy ablation of AF is a relatively new treatment option, and data on post-procedural outcomes in large general populations are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from the California State Inpatient Database, we identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adult patients who underwent their first AF ablation from 2005 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of complications and/or 30-day readmissions and Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> readmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 4,156 patients who underwent an initial AF ablation, 5% had periprocedural complications, most commonly vascular, and 9% were readmitted within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older age, female, prior AF hospitalizations, and less hospital experience with AF ablation were associated with higher adjusted risk of complications and/or 30-day readmissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause hospitalization was 38.5% by 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of readmission for recurrent AF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, and/or repeat ablation was 21.7% by 1 year and 29.6% by 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Periprocedural complications occurred in 1 of 20 patients undergoing AF ablation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related rehospitalizations were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Older age, female sex, prior AF hospitalizations, and recent hospital procedure experience were associated with a higher risk of complications and/or 30-day readmission after AF ablation </plain></SENT>
