<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dynamic indices, including pulse pressure, systolic pressure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume variation (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, SPV, and SVV), are accurate predictors of fluid responsiveness under strict conditions, for example, controlled mechanical ventilation using conventional tidal volumes (TVs) in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in routine clinical practice, these prerequisites are not always met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of regularly used ventilator settings, different calculation methods, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> on the ability of dynamic indices to predict fluid responsiveness in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 47 fluid challenges in 29 consecutive cardiac surgery patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into different groups based on TV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic indices were calculated in various ways: calculation over 30 s, breath-by-breath (with and without excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>), and with correction for TV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predictive value was optimal in the group ventilated with TVs &gt;7 ml kg(-1) with correction for TV, calculated breath-by-breath, and with exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> [area under the curve (AUC)=0.95, 0.93, and 0.90 for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, SPV, and SVV, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Including patients ventilated with lower TVs decreased the predictive value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dynamic indices, while calculating dynamic indices over 30 s and not excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> further reduced the AUC to 0.51, 0.63, and 0.51 for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, SPV, and SVV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>, SPV, and SVV are the only reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness under strict conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In routine clinical practice, factors including low TV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and the calculation method can substantially reduce their predictive value </plain></SENT>
