<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36592">pyrrolidin-2-one</z:chebi> derivatives (17 compounds) with adrenolytic properties was evaluated for antiarrhythmic, electrocardiographic and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of them displayed antiarrhythmic activity in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and in the rat coronary artery ligation-reperfusion model, and slightly decreased the heart rate, prolonged P-Q, Q-T intervals and QRS complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, compound EP-40 (1-[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36592">pyrrolidin-2-one</z:chebi> showed excellent antiarrhythmic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This compound had significantly <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that the antiarrhythmic effect of compound EP-40 is related to their adrenolytic and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A biological activity prediction using the PASS software shows that compound EP-35 and EP-40 can be characterized by antiischemic activity; whereas, compound EP-68, EP-70, EP-71 could be good <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> agents </plain></SENT>
