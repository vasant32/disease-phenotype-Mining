<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CS remains a difficult condition to diagnose, particularly in cases of isolated cardiac involvement and it can present with a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the appropriate management of these patients remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET has a potential role not only in diagnosis of CS but also in directing further therapies, facilitating the decision to start immunosuppression and monitoring the response to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this article, we discuss when to consider FDG-PET, outline the current optimal patient preparation and scanning protocols and then, using case examples, discuss the use of FDG-PET in follow-up of patients with known or suspected CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also outline how PET can influence management decisions in these patients </plain></SENT>
