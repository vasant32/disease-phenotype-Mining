<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides their deleterious effects, these factors may trigger adaptive processes in the heart resulting in greater resistance against IRI, which is also a characteristic feature of the female myocardium </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased ischemic tolerance can be induced by the pleiotropic (independent of the primary) effects of some hypolipidemic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs, even in the diseased myocardium </plain></SENT>
