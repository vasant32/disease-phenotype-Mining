<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The substrate of AF is composed of a complex interplay between structural and functional changes of the atrial myocardium often preceding the occurrence of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are only few animal models reproducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of the AF substrate to the spontaneous occurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice (TG) with cardiomyocyte-directed expression of CREM-IbΔC-X, an isoform of transcription factor CREM, develop atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and spontaneous-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we tested the hypothesis that TG mice develop an arrhythmogenic substrate preceding AF using physiological and biochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overexpression of CREM-IbΔC-X in young TG mice (&lt;8weeks) led to atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> combined with distension of myocardium, elongated myocytes, little <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, down-regulation of connexin 40, loss of excitability with a number of depolarized myocytes, atrial ectopies and inducibility of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities continuously progressed with age resulting in interatrial conduction block, increased atrial conduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and the spontaneous occurrence of paroxysmal and later persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This distinct atrial remodelling was associated with a pattern of non-regulated and up-regulated marker genes of <z:mp ids='MP_0010633'>myocardial hypertrophy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression of CREM-IbΔC-X in TG hearts evokes abnormal growth and development of the atria preceding conduction abnormalities and altered calcium homeostasis and the development of spontaneous and persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transcription factor CREM is an important regulator of atrial growth implicated in the development of an arrhythmogenic substrate in TG mice </plain></SENT>
