<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> after TBI manifests as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> excess, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001629'>abnormal heart rate</z:mp> variability, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, and is associated with poor neuropsychological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">Propranolol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> are centrally acting drugs that may decrease sympathetic outflow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is no prospective randomized evidence available demonstrating the feasibility, outcome benefits, and safety for adrenergic blockade after TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The DASH after TBI study is an actively accruing, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial, where one group receives centrally acting sympatholytic drugs, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (1 mg intravenously every 6 h for 7 days) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> (0.1 mg per tube every 12 h for 7 days), and the other group, double placebo, within 48 h of severe TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study uses a weighted adaptive minimization randomization with categories of age and Marshall head CT classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Feasibility will be assessed by ability to provide a neuroradiology read for randomization, by treatment contamination, and by treatment compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> level as measured on day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints include comprehensive plasma and urine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels, heart rate variability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> measures using the Richmond <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>Agitation</z:hpo>-Sedation Scale and Agitated Behavior scale, medication use (anti-hypertensive, sedative, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi>, and antipsychotic), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological outcomes will be measured at hospital discharge and at 3 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The domains tested will include global executive function, memory, processing speed, visual-spatial, and behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other assessments include the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and Quality of Life after Brain Injury scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Safety parameters evaluated will include cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The DASH After TBI Study is the first randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial powered to determine feasibility and investigate safety and outcomes associated with adrenergic blockade in patients with severe TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the study results in positive trends, this could provide pilot evidence for a larger multicenter randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If there is no effect of therapy, this trial would still provide a robust prospective description of sympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> after TBI </plain></SENT>
