<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although this measure has a high degree of reliability, diagnosticity, and sensitivity, a reliable physiological measure of cognitive workload could provide a non-invasive, objective measure of workload that could be tracked in real or near real-time without interrupting the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated changes in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) during seven different sub-sections of a proposed selection test for Navy aviation and compared them to changes reported on the NASA-TLX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>201 healthy participants performed the seven tasks of the Navy's Performance Based Measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RSA was measured during each task and the NASA-TLX was administered after each task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multi-level modeling revealed that RSA significantly predicted NASA-TLX scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A moderate within-subject correlation was also found between RSA and NASA TLX scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings support the potential development of RSA as a real-time measure of cognitive workload </plain></SENT>
