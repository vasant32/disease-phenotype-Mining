<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic activities are elevated in the central SNSs (sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems) of hypertensive animals, but it is not known whether sympathetic innervation is also elevated in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic hyper-responsiveness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may result from <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate sympathetic hyperinnervation in DOCA (deoxycorticosterone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>)-salt hypertensive rats with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks after the start of DOCA-salt treatment and uninephrectomization, male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups for 8 weeks: vehicle, NAC (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi>) and triple therapy (hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DOCA-salt was associated with increased oxidant release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DOCA-salt produced concentric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic hyperinnervation was observed in DOCA-salt rats, as assessed by myocardial <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> levels, immunofluorescent analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase, growth-associated factor 43 and neurofilament and Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) of NGF (nerve growth factor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in DOCA-salt rats were significantly higher than those in the control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Triple therapy, despite being effective on BP (blood pressure), offered neither attenuated cardiomyocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> nor anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effects of DOCA-salt treatment on NGF expression, sympathetic hyperinnervation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were attenuated by NAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of NAC on NGF were abolished by administering BSO (L-buthionine sulfoximine), an inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-cysteine ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DOCA-salt treatment contributes to up-regulation of NGF proteins probably through a free radical-dependent pathway in a BP-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DOCA-salt rats treated with NAC attenuate sympathetic hyperinnervation and thus show a beneficial effect on arrhythmogenic response to programmed electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
