<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Separation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder (SAD) is one of the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders in childhood and is predictive of adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030319" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">panic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the disorder has seldom been studied and the attempt to distinguish SAD from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders with regard to psychophysiology has not been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We expected exaggerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> as well as sympathetic and respiratory reactivity in SAD during separation from the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were 49 children with a principal diagnosis of SAD, 21 clinical controls (CC) with a principal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder other than SAD, and 39 healthy controls (HC) not meeting criteria for any current diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of covariance controlling for age were used to assess sympathetic and parasympathetic activation (preejection period and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) as well as cardiovascular (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, total peripheral resistance), respiratory (total breath time, minute ventilation, tidal volume, end-tidal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> , respiratory variability), electrodermal, and self-report (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, cognitions, symptoms) variables during baseline, 4-min separation from, and reunion with the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with a diagnosis of SAD were characterized by elevated self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> responses to separation and increased sympathetic reactivity compared with CC and HC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SAD group also displayed greater vagal withdrawal and higher reactivity in multiple cardiovascular, respiratory, and electrodermal measures compared with the HC group, while corresponding responses were less in the CC group and not significantly different from the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Separation from the mother elicits greater autonomic, respiratory, and experiential responses in children with SAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings based on brief experimental separation demonstrate differential subjective and physiological manifestations of specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> diagnoses, thus supporting the validity of the diagnostic category of SAD </plain></SENT>
