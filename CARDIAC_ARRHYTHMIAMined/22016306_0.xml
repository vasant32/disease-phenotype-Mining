<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: High thresholds and frequent lead dislodgement limit pacing the left atrium (LA) from the mid to distal coronary sinus (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this report is to describe a method for and the results of prolapsing a double-canted bipolar lead into the mid-to-distal CS to eliminate lead dislodgement and improve pacing thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: After CS access the 9 Fr. anatomic sheath is withdrawn to the right atrium (RA) over an extra support wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A double-canted bipolar lead is advanced into the RA until the proximal bend is outside the tip of the sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the stylet withdrawn to the proximal bend, the sheath and lead are advanced over the wire back into the CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lead distal to the proximal bend is prolapsed beside the sheath as the tip of the sheath enters the CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lead was successfully prolapsed in 11 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, capture was &gt;5 V in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 successful implants, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thresholds were: mean 1.53 V, median 1.35 V, range 0.4-4.0 V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> thresholds were: mean 2 V, median 2 V range 0.4-4.0 V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no displaced leads or lead fractures through 6-10 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_626'>Prolapse</z:mpath> of a commercially available double-canted bipolar passive fixation lead eliminates lead dislodgment and improves thresholds providing a means for permanent pacing of the LA from the mid to distal CS and provides the design principles for a dedicated lead </plain></SENT>
