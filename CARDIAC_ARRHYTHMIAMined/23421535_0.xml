<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> is the most important risk factor directly attributable to the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and is one of the few modifiable risk factors for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activation and overactivity of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (SNS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN) appears to be an effective adjunctive treatment for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and may be beneficial in other conditions characterized by SNS overactivity, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The H-FIB study is a multicenter prospective, double-blind, randomized (1:1) controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy endpoint is antiarrhythmic drug-free freedom from AF recurrence through 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a history of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> who are receiving treatment with at least one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive agent</z:chebi> who are planned for a first time ablation for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF will be randomized to either AF ablation alone (control group) or AF ablation + RSDN (study group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: H-FIB is a multicenter, randomized trial that will test the hypothesis that adjunctive renal sympathetic denervation, at the time of AF ablation, will increase the freedom from recurrent AF </plain></SENT>
