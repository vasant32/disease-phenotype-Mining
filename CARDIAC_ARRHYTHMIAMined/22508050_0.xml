<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) is involved in repolarization of cardiac action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of liensinine and neferine on the biophysical properties of hERG channel and the underlying structure-activity relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of liensinine and neferine were examined on the hERG channels in the stable transfected HEK293 cells using a whole-cell patch clamp technique, western blot analysis and immunofluorescence experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution determination of liensinine and neferine in rats were determined by a validated RP-HPLC method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liensinine and neferine induced decrease of current amplitude in dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liensinine reduced hERG tail current from 70.3±6.3 pA/pF in control group to 56.7±2.8 pA/pF in the 1 μM group, 53.0±2.3 pA/pF (3 μM) and 17.8±0.7 pA/pF (30 μM); the corresponding current densities of neferine-treated cells were 41.9±3.1 pA/pF, 32.3±3.1 pA/pF and 16.2±0.6 pA/pF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neferine had binding affinity for the open and inactivated state of hERG channel, liensinine only bound to the open state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of liensinine and neferine on hERG current were attenuated in the F656V or Y652A mutant channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neferine distributed more quickly than liensinine in rats, which was found to be in higher concentration than liensinine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both liensinine and neferine had no effect on the generation and expression of hERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, neferine is a more potent blocker of hERG channels than liensinine at low concentration (&lt;10 μM), which may be due to higher hydrophobic nature of neferine compared with liensinine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neferine may be safety even for long-term treatment as an antiarrhythmic drug </plain></SENT>
