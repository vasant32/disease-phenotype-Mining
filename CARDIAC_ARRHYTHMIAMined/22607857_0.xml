<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated differences in clinical and angiographic features, practice patterns, and outcomes between Canada and United States in 2,086 patients with ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> undergoing primary PCI in the APEX <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2,086 patients, 335 (19%) were enrolled in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with US patients, Canadians were older with lower body mass index and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> clearance and less likely to have history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking, or prior revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> artery patency was higher, and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump and drug-eluting stents was lower in Canadian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median door-to-PCI time was significantly shorter among Canadian patients (0.9 hours [interquartile range 0.6-1.3] vs 1.2 hours [interquartile range 0.8-1.7]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes at 90 days were lower among Canadian patients, including shock (2.7% vs 4.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (3.6% vs 5.6%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (3.6% vs 9.6%), and atrial (3.6% vs 7.4%) and ventricular (3.0% vs 6.4%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 90-day mortality (2.7% vs 4.8%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-1.28) and composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, shock, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (6.8% vs 11.5%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.47-1.27) were similar in the 2 cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with US patients, Canadian patients had shorter door-to-PCI time but similar 90-day outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest an opportunity for US sites to examine and learn from the Canadian systems of processes of care and implement changes so as to improve the timeliness of primary PCI </plain></SENT>
