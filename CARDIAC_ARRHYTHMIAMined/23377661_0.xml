<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose Panobinostat, a pan-deacetylase inhibitor, is a promising anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> agent that increases acetylation of proteins associated with growth and survival pathways of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary objective of this phase I dose-escalation study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous (i.v.) panobinostat administered on different dosing schedules in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Secondary objective was to characterize safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profiles, and activities of the i.v. formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods i.v. panobinostat was administered at escalating doses on a daily (days 1-3 and 8-10 of a 21-day cycle; days 1-3 and 15-17 of a 28-day cycle) or weekly (days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle; days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) schedule, and safety and tolerability were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial blood samples were collected following dosing for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results The MTD for the daily administration schedule was 7.2 g/m(2), whereas the MTD for the weekly schedule was 20.0 mg/m(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including prolonged QTcF, DLTs associated with the study drug were principally due to myelosuppressive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum concentrations and bioavailability of i.v. panobinostat increased dose-proportionally across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Based on the results of this study and others, the i.v. formulation of panobinostat was well tolerated in many patients, but concerns remain regarding its potential suitability outside the study setting due to potential electrocardiogram abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further development will focus on the panobinostat oral formulation </plain></SENT>
