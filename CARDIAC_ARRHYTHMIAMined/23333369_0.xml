<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about risk factors for AF with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LA size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively followed 34713 initially healthy women for incident AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on echocardiographic LA size at first AF diagnosis was abstracted from medical charts during AF confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LA enlargement was defined as LA diameter &gt;40mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using a competing risk approach, we constructed Cox proportional-hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of risk factors for incident AF with and without LA enlargement, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 796 women with incident AF and available LA size, 328 (41%) had LA enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariable competing risk models, the relationship between age and incident AF was stronger in those with (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.14) versus without (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.09) LA enlargement (p for difference &lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Body weight was associated with AF only in the presence of LA enlargement (HR per 10kg 1.34, 95% CI 1.26-1.43; versus 1.07, 95% CI 0.998-1.14, p for difference&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and height were significantly associated with AF both in the presence (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.49-2.65; and HR per 10cm 1.36, 95% CI 1.13-1.63) and absence (1.55, 1.25-1.92 and 1.29, 1.10-1.50) of LA enlargement (p for difference 0.17 and 0.66, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that LA enlargement explains much of the increased AF risk associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, height and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appear to also influence AF risk through other mechanisms besides LA enlargement </plain></SENT>
