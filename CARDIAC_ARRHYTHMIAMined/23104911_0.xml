<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To study, using simulation, the spectral characteristics of different patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) at high spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dominant frequency (DF) and organization index (OI) maps have been used to approximate the location of the focal source of high frequency during AF events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A realistic three-dimensional model of the human atria that includes fibre orientation, electrophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and anisotropy was implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular model was modified to simulate electrical remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than 43 000 electrograms were calculated on the surface, and were processed to reconstitute the DF and OI maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes were triggered by a source of transitory and of continuous activity (both with a cycle length of 130 ms) in five different locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maps obtained during the AF events triggered by transitory foci did not show areas with high DF or OI values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When continuous foci were applied, the DF maps show ample zones with high values in the atrium where the focus was applied; while OI maps display smaller areas with high values, always within the areas of high DF and, in three of five locations, this high-value area was located at the site of focus application and at the nearby area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other two locations, the area presenting the highest OI values is small and located at the site of focus application, which allowed its precise localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Organization index maps provide a better approximation than DF maps for the localization of ectopic sources of high frequency and continuous activity during episodes of simulated AF in remodelled tissue </plain></SENT>
