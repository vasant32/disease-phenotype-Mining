<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is becoming one of the most widely employed therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet selection of patients who will benefit from this treatment remains a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous works have examined several electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters as potential predictors of CA success, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, they require a manual computation and consider only a subset of electrodes, so inter-lead spatial variability of the 12-lead ECG is not fully exploited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study puts forward an automatic procedure for f-wave amplitude computation to non-invasively predict CA outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An extension of this quantitative measure to the whole set of leads is also proposed, based on Principal Component Analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that exploiting the spatial diversity present in the surface ECG not only improves the robustness to electrode selection but also increases the predictive power of the amplitude parameter </plain></SENT>
