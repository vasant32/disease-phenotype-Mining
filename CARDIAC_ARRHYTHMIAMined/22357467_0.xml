<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the status of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in patients with β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia intermedia</z:e> and major in mainland China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The status of transfusion and chelation was examined in 39 patients with β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia intermedia</z:e> or major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI T2* technique was used to detect cardiac and hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum ferritin levels ranged from the minimum of 1500 ng/mL up to a maximum of 11491 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From liver MRI T2* measurement, 15 cases had severe hepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> (38%) and moderate deposition was found in 15 cases (38%), mild in 7 cases (18%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 2 cases (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Heart MRI T2* showed severe heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in 7 cases (18%), mild in 5 cases (13%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 27 cases (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four cases were over 20 years of age, and presented with gonadal function <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients did not receive regular transfusion and they had delayed, suboptimal chelation due to financial problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin level was closely related with timing and dosage of chelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> who do not receive early regular transfusion and iron chelation therapy, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> may occur at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Important organs and tissue functional lesions and related complications also result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Relevant agencies and family members should be aware of this trend and develop appropriate strategies to improve the medical condition and quality of life of patients with this disorder </plain></SENT>
