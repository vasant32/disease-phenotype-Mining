<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine whether a cyclic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE), PDE4, is expressed in human atrium and contributes to the control of electrical stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is accompanied by a profound remodeling of membrane receptors and alterations in cAMP-dependent regulation of Ca(2+) handling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Being responsible for cAMP hydrolysis, PDEs are likely to play a role in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the rodent heart, PDE4 contributes up to 60% of total cAMP-hydrolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, its role in the human heart remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: L-type Ca(2+) current and spontaneous Ca(2+) release were recorded in isolated human atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intracellular cAMP was measured by live cell imaging using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contractile force and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded in human atrial trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PDE activity was measured in human atrial tissue from patients in sinus rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PDE4 is expressed in human atrial myocytes and accounts for approximately 15% of total PDE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PDE4D represents the major PDE4 subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PDE4 inhibition increased intracellular cAMP and L-type Ca(2+) current and dramatically delayed their decay after a brief β-adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PDE4 inhibition also increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) release at baseline, as well as the contractile response and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in human atrial strips during β-adrenergic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Total PDE activity decreased with age, and the relative PDE4 activity was lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> than in age-matched sinus rhythm controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PDE4 is critical in controlling cAMP levels and thereby Ca(2+) influx and release in human atrial muscle, hence limiting the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
