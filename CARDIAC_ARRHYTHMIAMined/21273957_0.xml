<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorder</z:hpo>, originating in a pluripotent stem cell common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three hematopoietic lineages, characterized by overproduction of myeloid cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approval of the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> in the United States in 2001 and its introduction in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> changed the evolution and prognosis of the disease and began the era of molecular therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">Imatinib</z:chebi> is highly effective and causes fewer adverse reactions than earlier treatments based on interferon and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Cuba, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> has been treated with interferon since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Starting in 2003, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> was gradually introduced for use in newly-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> as first-line therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in a group of Cuban patients, based on hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response; overall and event-free survival rates; and most frequency and severity of adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During May 2003 to May 2008, 33 newly-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients (25 adults, 8 children; &lt;6 months from diagnosis) received a single daily oral dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> 400 mg from the time of study enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Variables used: (1) to evaluate treatment efficacy: hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response; overall and event-free survival; and (2) to evaluate safety: presence of adverse reactions leading to definitive interruption of treatment or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete hematologic response occurred in 100% of patients, major cytogenetic response in 90.9%, and complete cytogenetic response in 48.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Molecular response occurred in 36.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a mean follow-up of 39 months, overall survival was 96% and estimated five-year event-free survival was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No adverse reactions occurred in 39.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions most frequently observed were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> (24.2%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive disorders</z:e> (21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These were followed, in decreasing order, by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, primarily orbital (9.1%), skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162835" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">depigmentation</z:e> (3%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45783">imatinib</z:chebi> was effective first-line therapy for patients with newly-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, as determined by overall and event-free survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No severe adverse reactions were observed </plain></SENT>
