<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> presents with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, conduction system disease (CSD), and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Knowing the time interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CSD and its progression to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> would help to guide clinical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated family members from 16 pedigrees previously identified to carry LMNA mutations for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>, CSD, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and of left ventricular enlargement (LVE) and/or systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 103 subjects, 64 carried their family LMNA mutation, and 51 (79%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> with a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of 41.2 years (range 18-76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ventricular dysfunction was observed in 26 with a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of 47.6 years (range 28-82); at diagnosis 9 had systolic dysfunction but no LVE, 5 had LVE but no systolic dysfunction, and 11 had <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 16 subjects identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> who later developed ventricular dysfunction, the median <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> by log-rank analyses were 41 and 48 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> preceded <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> with a median difference of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical surveillance should occur at least annually in those at risk for LMNA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> with any ECG findings </plain></SENT>
