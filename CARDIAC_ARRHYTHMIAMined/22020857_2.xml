<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many important differences in the presentation and clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are present between men and women that should be accounted for in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review published data on gender differences in cardiac excitable properties, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, and the utilisation of implantable defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women have a higher heart rate at rest, and a longer QT interval than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They further have a narrower QRS complex and lower QRS voltages on the 12-lead ECG with more often non-specific repolarisation abnormalities at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>Supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, such as AV nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, are twice as frequent in women compared with men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, however, has a 1.5-fold higher prevalence in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The triggers for idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) initiation are gender specific, i.e. hormonal changes play an important role in the occurrence of these VTs in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are clear-cut gender differences in acquired and congenital LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> affects men more commonly and severely than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>Sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> is less prevalent in women at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages and occurs 10Â years later in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may be related to the later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinically manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients who receive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> and CRT devices, women appear to be under-represented, while they may benefit even more from these novel therapies </plain></SENT>
