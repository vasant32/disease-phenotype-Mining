<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various antidepressants are commonly used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and several other neuropsychiatric disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to their primary effects on serotonergic or noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems, antidepressants have been shown to interact with several receptors and ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of antidepressants have not yet been sufficiently clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G protein-activated inwardly rectifying <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (GIRK, Kir3) channels play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and heart rate, and GIRK channel modulation has been suggested to have therapeutic potential for several neuropsychiatric disorders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of various classes of antidepressants on GIRK channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In oocytes injected with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for GIRK1/GIRK2 or GIRK1/GIRK4 subunits, extracellular application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2675">amoxapine</z:chebi> effectively reduced GIRK currents, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7494">nefazodone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9943">venlafaxine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51137">mianserin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6950">mirtazapine</z:chebi> weakly inhibited GIRK currents even at toxic levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects were concentration-dependent, with various degrees of potency and effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> were voltage-independent and time-independent during each voltage pulse, whereas the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36796">duloxetine</z:chebi> were voltage-dependent with weaker inhibition with negative membrane potentials and time-dependent with a gradual decrease in each voltage pulse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, Kir2.1 channels were insensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the GIRK currents induced by <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> were inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> but not by intracellularly applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that GIRK channel inhibition may reveal a novel characteristic of the commonly used antidepressants, particularly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi>, and contributes to some of the therapeutic effects and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
