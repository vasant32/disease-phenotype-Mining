<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Potential side effects of stimulants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit disorder</z:hpo> are in the focus of scientific discussions, intensified by the higher number of prescriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with known <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or other severe cardiac problems should not receive stimulants because of their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 24-hour Holter electrocardiograms from 100 consecutive children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit disorder</z:hpo> from January, 2006 to April, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, nine children had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (mean age 11.4 Â± 3.1 years, 77% male, 77% received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these children had ventricular parasystole - four of them with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0078888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AIVR">accelerated idioventricular rhythm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant circadian rhythm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> in seven children and the effect of standing and exercise clearly indicate the influence of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these children, hourly analysis of circadian rhythm within a 24-hour period showed a highly significant correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> and the vagal tone indicated by the heart rate variability parameter RMSSD (r = -0.83; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> was unaffected in seven children who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> before diagnosis and decreased during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: By Holter electrocardiogram analysis, we observed a remarkably high incidence of ventricular parasystole and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0078888" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AIVR">accelerated idioventricular rhythm</z:e> in nine of 100 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit disorder</z:hpo>, which depends on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262385" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic imbalance</z:e> and not on stimulant treatment </plain></SENT>
