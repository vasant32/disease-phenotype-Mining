<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty New Zealand rabbits were divided into four groups randomly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, 20 rabbits received intracerebroventricular (icv) saline, and then received icv ropivacaine 30 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whenever dysrhythmias continued for more than 5 min, 0.1 ml saline was administered into the left cerebral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes later, 0.1 ml midazolam was given into the left lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group 3, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine, and once the dysrhythmias developed, the inspired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> concentration was increased from 0.75% to 1.50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group 4, 20 animals received an intravenous (iv) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> infusion until dysrhythmias occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Group 1, the rabbits did not develop dysrhythmias in response to icv saline, whereas dysrhythmias did develop in these animals after icv ropivacaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, icv saline had no effect on the dysrhythmias; however, icv midazolam terminated cardiac dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Group 3, an increase in the concentration of the inspired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> had no effect on dysrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Group 4, icv midazolam had no effect on dysrhythmias in response to iv <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ropivacaine administered directly into the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> is capable of producing cardiac dysrhythmias; midazolam terminated dysrhythmias presumably by potentiation of Î³-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) receptor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that ropivacaine produces some of its cardiotoxicity not only by the direct cardiotoxicity of the drug, but also by the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> effects of ropivacaine </plain></SENT>
