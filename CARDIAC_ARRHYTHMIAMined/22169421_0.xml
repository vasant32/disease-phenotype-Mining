<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between electrocardiographic (ECG) features and disease severity in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study group consisted of 61 subjects with a definite diagnosis of ARVC on the basis of published guideline criteria and patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to the extent of diseased myocardium defined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Group A: local involvement (n = 19, 31%), Group B: diffuse involvement of whole right ventricle (n = 28, 46%) and Group C: involvement of both right and left ventricles (n = 14, 23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> electrocardiogram was shown in 1 patient in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epsilon wave was detected in 24 (39%) patients, QRS duration was prolonged [≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] in 21 (34%) patients, S-wave upstroke was prolonged (≥ 55 ms) in 17 (28%) patients, complete right branch bundle block was evidenced in 10 (16%) patients and pathologic Q waves was found in 9 (15%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of above <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> changes was increased in proportion to the degree of disease severity (group A &lt; group B &lt; group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of Epsilon wave and prolonged QRS duration [ ≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] were significantly higher in Group C than in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms) was significantly higher in Group C than in Group A and Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T-wave inversion in V(1) leads was often found in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-wave inversion in inferior leads (V(1)-V(3) leads or beyond V(3)) was often presented in Group B and Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> ECG does not exclude the possibility of diagnosis of ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads and incidence of Epsilon wave, prolonged QRS duration [ ≥ 110 ms (V(1)-V(3))] and prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms) were related to degree of disease severity in patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
