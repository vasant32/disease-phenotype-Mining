<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrial and Pulmonary Vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) muscle sleeve microstructural remodeling is present, and establishes a vulnerable substrate for AF maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of an incomplete understanding of the anatomo-functional basis for AF, current evidence demonstrates that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> usually requires a trigger for initiation and a vulnerable electrophysiological and/or anatomical substrate for maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is still unclear whether the trigger mechanisms include focal enhanced automaticity, triggered activity and/or micro re-entry from myocardial tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initiation of AF can be favored by both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation, which also seem to play a role in maintaining AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, evolving clinical evidence demonstrates that <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and recurrent AF through a mechanism that possibly involves cellular degeneration, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and subsequent atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
