<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> may experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> for which electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, about the safety of ECT in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety of ECT in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and decreased left ventricular systolic heart function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 35 patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and reduced left ventricular systolic heart function who underwent ECT at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, between January 1995 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 35 patients, 18 (51%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 77 years (range, 54-92 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% (range, 15%-40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 35 patients underwent 513 ECT sessions (median number of sessions per patient, 10; range, 1-44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 35 patients tolerated ECT well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient died or experienced decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> during or within 24 hours after an ECT session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic intravenous Î²-blockers were given to patients who, during previous ECT sessions, had marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (eg, systolic blood pressure &gt;180-200 mm Hg) or a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute; overall, this prophylaxis was used in 26 patients during 413 ECT sessions (80% of the total number of ECT sessions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced temporary, non-life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy was safe in 35 patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and decreased left ventricular systolic heart function treated at our institution </plain></SENT>
