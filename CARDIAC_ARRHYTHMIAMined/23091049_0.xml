<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of externalized conductors and electrical abnormalities in Riata <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> leads by fluoroscopic screening and standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation centers were contacted by the Netherlands Heart Rhythm Association Device Advisory Committee to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with an active Riata <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> lead and to perform fluoroscopic screening of the lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the electrical integrity of the lead was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As of March 1, 2012, data for 1029 active Riata leads were available; 47% of these were 8-F Riata and 53% were 7-F Riata ST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Externalized conductors were observed in 147 leads (14.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proportion of externalized conductors was higher in 8-F Riata compared with 7-F Riata ST (21.4% vs 8.0%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time from implantation to detection of externalized conductors was 65.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The estimated rates of externalized conductors were 6.9% and 36.6% at 5 and 8 years after implantation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 147 leads with externalized conductors, 10.9% had abnormal electrical parameters vs 3.5% in nonexternalized leads (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of externalized conductors in Riata leads is significantly high (14.3%) using fluoroscopic screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of externalized conductors are not detectable with standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening with fluoroscopy is reasonable </plain></SENT>
