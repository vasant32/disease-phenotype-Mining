<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was carried out in a tertiary referral centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 29 patients diagnosed with supraventricular foetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> between 2001 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mode of presentation, foetal cardiac function, maternal anti-arrhythmic serum levels, drug tolerance, and maternal electrocardiogram recordings were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postnatal outcome of each infant was also evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 27 foetuses were treated with digoxin and flecainide combination, and two foetuses were delivered without any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 27 foetuses treated, six [corrected] had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and the remaining 21 [corrected] had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011688'>atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were eight foetuses with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> (27%), of whom three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011688'>atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia</z:hpo>; 26 foetuses (96%) responded to flecainide and digoxin combination, with restoration of sinus rhythm in 22 (81.4%) and rate control in the other four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one severely hydropic foetus, there was no response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 26 treated infants were delivered alive, but one pregnancy was terminated for non-cardiac causes when the foetus was in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no intrauterine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although there were minor side effects to anti-arrhythmic medications, none of the pregnant women developed proarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flecainide and digoxin combination treatment offers a safe and effective treatment for foetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> with fast restoration of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
