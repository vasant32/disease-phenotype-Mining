<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> contribute to mortality in a number of pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several parameters obtained from a non-invasive, easily obtained electrocardiogram (ECG) are established, well-validated prognostic indicators of cardiac risk in patients suffering from a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>Increased heart rate</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003929'>decreased heart rate variability</z:mp> (HRV), and increased duration and variability of cardiac ventricular electrical activity (QT interval) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicative of enhanced cardiac risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animal models, it is valuable to compare these ECG-derived variables and susceptibility to experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous infusion of the arrhythmogenic agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> has been widely used to evaluate susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a range of experimental conditions, including animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, following exercise and exposure to air pollutants, as well as determination of the antiarrhythmic efficacy of pharmacological agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that QT dispersion in humans is a measure of QT interval variation across the full set of leads from a standard 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the measure of QT dispersion from the 2-lead ECG in the rat described in this protocol is different than that calculated from human ECG records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represents a limitation in the translation of the data obtained from rodents to human clinical medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>Status epilepticus</z:hpo> (SE) is a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> or series of continuously recurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> lasting more than 30 min, and results in mortality in 20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many individuals survive the SE, but die within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism(s) of this delayed mortality is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> contribute to many of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition to SE, patients experiencing spontaneously recurring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, are at risk of premature sudden and unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SUDEP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As with SE, the precise mechanisms mediating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SUDEP</z:e> are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that ventricular abnormalities and resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> make a significant contribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-related cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and the efficacy of cardioprotective therapies, it is necessary to obtain both ECG-derived indicators of risk and evaluate susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Here we describe methods for implanting ECG electrodes in the Sprague-Dawley laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus), following SE, collection and analysis of ECG recordings, and induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during iv infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These procedures can be used to directly determine the relationships between ECG-derived measures of cardiac electrical activity and susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rat models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorders, or any pathology associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
