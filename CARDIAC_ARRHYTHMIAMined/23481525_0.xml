<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background- Comparative effectiveness reviews offer a systematic method to critically appraise existing research and to identify unaddressed clinical areas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> where significant morbidity, mortality, and variation in the use of resources persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To delineate and help select areas where comparative effectiveness reviews are needed, the Effective Health Care Program of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality involved stakeholders in prioritization of the research agenda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We involved a diverse panel of stakeholders representing a broad range of clinical, policy, and patient perspectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assist in prioritization of topics for evidence synthesis, we created a framework evaluating 12 cardiovascular disease subcategories that reflect American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association disease-based guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed an environmental scan for each disease subcategory to populate this framework with existing knowledge, levels of evidence, and degrees of public interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through a formalized process, 4 disease subcategories were prioritized: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within these subcategories, 11 topics that address the comparative safety and effectiveness of existing treatments and evaluate emerging treatments were nominated by the stakeholder panel to proceed for feasibility assessment before developing comparative effectiveness reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Using a systematic process deriving consensus from multiple stakeholders across cardiovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp>, we generated a prioritized list of evidence synthesis topics to inform decision makers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The topics vetted through this process seek to determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of a range of treatments, both established and emerging, and are immediately relevant for prevalent <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
