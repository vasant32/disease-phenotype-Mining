<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 5.5 Â± 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on indications for system upgrade and complications were collected by reviewing patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between predictors and system upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients (9.3%) in the AAIR group underwent system upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine of these patients (89.3%) had a documented class I indication for system upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age (aOR 0.98 for each 1-year increase in age; 95% CI 0.6-1.0), and left atrial enlargement (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0-3.8) were predictors for system upgrade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No single clinically applicable predictor for upgrade was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 patients (16.7%) experienced at least one major complication after system upgrade.CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with AAIR pacing who underwent system upgrade had a class I indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of major complications after system upgrade was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present data support the use of DDDR pacing rather than AAIR pacing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
