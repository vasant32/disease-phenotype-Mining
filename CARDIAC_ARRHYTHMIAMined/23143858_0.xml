<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Although an increase in the ventricular pacing threshold (VPT) has been observed after administration of transthoracic shock for ventricular defibrillation, few studies have evaluated the phenomenon with respect to the defibrillation waveform energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study examined the VPT behaviour after transthoracic shock with a monophasic or biphasic energy waveform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: Domestic Landrace male piglets implanted with a permanent pacemaker stimulation system were divided into three groups: no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) induction and transthoracic shock with monophasic or biphasic energy (group I); <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> induction, 1 min of observation without intervention, 2 min of external cardiac massage, and transthoracic shock with monophasic or biphasic energy (group II); and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> induction, 2 min of observation without intervention, 4 min of external cardiac massage, and transthoracic shock with monophasic or biphasic energy (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After external shock, the VPT was evaluated every minute for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 143 experiments were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of the observation period, groups I and II showed steady VPT values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group III showed an increase in VPT with monophasic or biphasic external energy, with no difference between the external energy sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The monophasic but not the biphasic waveform was associated with higher VPT values when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Defibrillation does not have a significant impact on pacing threshold, but a longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> period is related to a higher VPT after defibrillation with monophasic waveform </plain></SENT>
