<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of MetS on mortality and morbidity late after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 1,726 consecutive patients who had elective coronary artery bypass grafting were retrospectively reviewed and clinical follow-up was completed (mean follow-up time, 34.4 months; range, 6 to 79 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MetS was diagnosed using the modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, and to eliminate covariate differences, a propensity score adjustment was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events were investigated, and C-reactive protein levels were assessed both preoperatively, postoperatively, and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 798 of 1,726 patients (46.2%) met the diagnostic criteria for MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (7% versus 4.6%; p=0.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (35.3% versus 25.2%; p&lt;0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (12% versus 8.7%; p=0.03), and major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (52.4% versus 39.5%; p&lt;0.0001) showed a significantly higher incidence in MetS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variables correlated with late mortality at propensity-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression were age (p=0.0008), preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.001), preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (p=0.001), and MetS (p=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher C-reactive protein levels were found preoperatively (8.6±2.3 versus 5.14±3.1 mg/L; p&lt;0.0001) and both early (71.2±9 versus 49.6±8.7 mg/L; p&lt;0.0001) and late (7.4±2.7 versus 4.8±2.5 mg/L; p&lt;0.0001) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of our study was the association between MetS and mortality both early and late after coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, MetS should be recognized as an independent preoperative variable that can lead to the identification of high-risk patients and as a risk factor to correct with lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy </plain></SENT>
