<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of transmural repolarization alternans and to investigate the link between alternans and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in rabbits with left ventricular dysfunction following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optical mapping was used to record action potentials from the transmural surface of left ventricular wedge preparations from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and post-infarction hearts during a progressive reduction in pacing cycle length at 30 and 37°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using custom software, including spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in baseline transmural electrophysiology between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-infarction hearts had a lower threshold for both repolarization alternans (286 vs. 333 bpm, p&lt;0.05) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (79 vs. 19%, p&lt;0.01) during rapid pacing, which was not accounted for by increased transmural discordant alternans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-prone hearts, alternans in optical action potential amplitude was observed and increased until 2:1 block occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of optical action potential amplitude alternans (12.0 ± 7.0 vs. 1.8 ± 0.3, p&lt;0.05), but not APD(90) alternans (1.4 ± 0.6 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1, p&gt;0.05) was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> inducibility during rapid pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-infarction hearts are more vulnerable to transmural alternans and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> at rapid rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternans in optical action potential amplitude was associated with conduction block and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that changes in optical action potential amplitude may underlie a mechanism for alternans-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in left ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
