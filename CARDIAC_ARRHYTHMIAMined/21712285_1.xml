<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the use of antithrombotic treatment in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who came to our institution to have their pacemakers checked during the year 2008 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The atrial activity was assessed by slowing down the paced frequency if necessary, and by the analysis of atrial electrograms in atrial-based pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The appropriateness of the antithrombotic treatment was evaluated by a cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Out of 585 patients, 216 (36.9%) displayed AF at some point during the 5.5-year monitoring period (1.5-11), although only 58 (9.9%) displayed it at the time of the implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 216, 58% were men, with an average age of 80 years (76-86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pacemaker was implanted in response to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> (AVB) in 46.3% of the cases, sinoatrial node disorder in 24.1% of the cases, and slow AF in 25.9% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CHADS2 score was 0 points in 4.2% (9) of the cases, 1 point in 19% (41) of the cases, and â‰¥ 2 points in 77% (173) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite this, only 58.3% of the cases received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The existence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at the time of implantation [odds ratio (OR) = 4.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.72-10.51; P = 0.002] and the implantation of a pacemaker with atrioventricular synchronization (OR = 13.23; 95% CI, 2.89-60.56; P = 0.001) were associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in those cases with CHADS2&gt;2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is common in patients fitted with pacemakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the high risk of embolism, an underuse of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment was observed </plain></SENT>
