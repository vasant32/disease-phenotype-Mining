<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 2-dimensional ventricular muscle layer was prepared in rabbit hearts, and action potential signals were analyzed by optical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During constant stimulation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISP, 0.1 µM) significantly shortened action potential duration (APD); chromanol 293B (30 µM), a selective I(Ks)-blocker, reversed the APD shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VTs induced in the presence of ISP lasted longer than in the control, and this was reversed by 293B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E-4031 (0.1 µM), a selective I(Kr)-blocker, did not cause such reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spiral-wave (SW) reentry with ISP was characterized by more stable rotation around a shorter functional block line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FBL</z:e>) than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After application of 293B, SW reentry was destabilized, and rotation around a longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FBL</z:e> with prominent drift reappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The APD abbreviation by ISP close to the rotation center was more pronounced than in the periphery, leading to an opposite APD gradient (center &lt; periphery) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was also reversed by 293B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, β-adrenergic stimulation stabilizes SW reentry most likely though an enhancement of I(Ks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blockade of I(Ks) may be a promising therapeutic modality in prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias under high sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
