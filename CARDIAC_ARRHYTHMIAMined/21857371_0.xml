<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Exercise is protective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (I), the condition of inadequate blood flow, and reperfusion (R), the reestablishment of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This protection is observed clinically and scientifically by decreased incidence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous scoring systems exist for the quantification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of preventricular contractions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> frequency, these scoring systems are intended to provide more robust ECG outcome indicators than individual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scoring systems vary primarily on continuous versus discontinuous treatment of the data, which should be considered when matching these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> metrics to scientific applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this investigation was to evaluate seven ECG scoring systems in the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> severity after IR in male Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Animals remained sedentary or exercised (3 d of treadmill exercise for 60 min) before surgically induced IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subset of sedentary animals served as sham, undergoing surgical procedure without IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECGs were evaluated under blinded conditions by three trained individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Single <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> data and the parametric score were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare group means for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonparametric scoring systems between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IR produced a significant arrhythmic response in exercised and sedentary rats as determined by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> metrics resulted in significant differences between exercised and sedentary treatments (P &lt; 0.001), whereas three metrics did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Continuous versus discontinuous treatment of the data may account for variation in scoring system outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data confirm that exercise protects against IR-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and care must be taken when selecting an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scoring system for ECG evaluation </plain></SENT>
