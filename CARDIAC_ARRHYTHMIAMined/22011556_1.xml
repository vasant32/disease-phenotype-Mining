<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (POAF) is associated with poorer short- and long-term outcomes after isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there is considerable debate as to whether this reflects an independent association of POAF with poorer outcomes or confounding by other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data obtained from June 2001 through December 2009 by the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database Program were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and operative data were compared between patients who developed POAF and those who did not using chi-square and t tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent impact of POAF on 14 short-term complications and long-term mortality was determined using binary logistic and Cox regression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excluding patients with preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery was performed in 19,497 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5,547 (28.5%) developed POAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with POAF were generally older (mean age 69 vs 65 years, p &lt;0.001) and presented more often with co-morbidities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001), cerebrovascular disease (p &lt;0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with POAF demonstrated a greater 30-day mortality on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis (p = 0.376) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with POAF were, however, at an independently increased risk of perioperative complications including permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001), new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (p &lt;0.001), infective complications (p &lt;0.001), gastrointestinal complications (p &lt;0.001), and return to the theater (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>POAF was also independently associated with shorter long-term survival (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, POAF is a risk factor for short-term morbidity and decreased long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rigorous evaluation of various therapies that prevent or decrease the impact of POAF is imperative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients who develop POAF should undergo strict surveillance and be routinely screened for complications after discharge </plain></SENT>
