<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Identification of recurrent patterns in complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) has been used to differentiate paroxysmal from persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of the atrial CFAE patterns might therefore be assistive in guiding radiofrequency catheter ablation to drivers of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study a technique for robust detection and classification of recurrent CFAE patterns is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: CFAE were obtained from the four pulmonary vein ostia, and from the anterior and posterior left atrium, in 10 patients with paroxysmal AF and 10 patients with longstanding persistent AF (216 recordings in total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequences 8.4 s in length were analyzed (8,192 sample points, 977 Hz sampling) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 216 sequences, two recurrent patterns A and B were substituted for 4 and 5 of the sequences, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To this data, random interference, and random interference + noise were separately added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basis vectors were constructed using a new transform that is derived from ensemble averaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patterns A and B were then detected and classified using a threshold level of Euclidean distance between spectral signatures as constructed with transform coefficients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the presence of interference, sensitivity to detect and distinguish two patterns A and B was 96.2%, while specificity to exclude nonpatterns was 98.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the presence of interference + noise, sensitivity was 89.1% while specificity was 97.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transform coefficients computed from ensemble averages can be used to succinctly quantify synchronized patterns present in AF data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The technique is useful to automatically detect recurrent patterns in CFAE that are embedded in interference without user bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This quantitation can be implemented in real-time to map the AF substrate prior to and during catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
