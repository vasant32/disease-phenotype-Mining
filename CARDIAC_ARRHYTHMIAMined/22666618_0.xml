<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is increasing in parallel with an ageing population leading to increased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most feared complication of AF is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> being responsible for up to 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An important contributor to this increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the left atrial appendage (LAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A combination of the LAA's unique geometry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> leads to low blood flow velocity and stasis, which are precursors to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized for over half a century that excision of the LAA would lead to a reduction in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has only been in the last 20-25 years that the knowledge and technology has been available to safely carry out such a procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now have a number of viable techniques, both surgical and percutaneous, which will be covered in this paper </plain></SENT>
