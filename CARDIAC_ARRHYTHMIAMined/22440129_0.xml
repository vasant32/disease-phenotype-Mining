<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and the clinical impact of AF types on outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) treated invasively, we analyzed 2,980 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> admitted to our department from 2003 through 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data collected by the insurer were screened to identify patients who died during the median follow-up of 41 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AF was recognized in 282 patients (9.46%, AF group); the remaining 2,698 patients (90.54%) were free of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AF group was divided into 3 subgroups: prehospital paroxysmal AF (n = 92, 3.09%), new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF (n = 109, 3.66%), and permanent AF (n = 81, 2.72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital and long-term mortalities were significantly higher (p &lt;0.001 for the 2 comparisons) in the AF than in the control group (14.9% vs 5.3%, 37.2% vs 17.0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Long-term mortality was significantly higher (p &lt;0.001 for the 2 comparisons) in the new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF (35.8%) and permanent AF (54.3%) groups than in the control group but did not differ significantly between the prehospital AF and control groups (21.7% vs 17.0%, p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> separately, only permanent AF (hazard ratio 2.59) was an independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the studied population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AF occurs in 1 of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> treated invasively, with nearly equal distributions among prehospital, new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and permanent forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is a marker of worse short- and long-term outcomes, only permanent AF is an independent predictor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
