<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Conduction block in the posterior right atrium (RA) plays an important role in perpetuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although conduction blocks have functional properties, it is not clear how the block line changes with the pacing rate, pacing site, and administration of antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients with typical AFL were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pacing (110, 170, 230 ppm) from the coronary sinus ostium (CSo) and low lateral RA was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 mg/kg pilsicainide (pure <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel blockade) administration, the pacing protocol was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conduction block was assessed based on a color-coded isopotential map and 20 points of virtual unipolar electrograms in the posterior RA using noncontact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Block line proportion was defined as the percentage of length of the block line between the superior and inferior vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pacing rate-dependent extension of the block proportion was significant during pacing from both sides (pacing from the CSo: 59 ± 17% at 110 ppm, 69 ± 16% at 230 ppm, P &lt; 0.05; pacing from the low lateral RA: 43 ± 19% at 110 ppm, 55 ± 22% at 230 ppm, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The block line was significantly longer during CSo pacing than during low lateral RA pacing at each rate (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After pilsicainide administration, the block line extended further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to pacing rate-dependent and site-dependent changes in the block line, pilsicainide further extended the block line length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon explains the clinical observation that counterclockwise AFL occurs more frequently than clockwise AFL, and the mechanism of class IC AFL </plain></SENT>
