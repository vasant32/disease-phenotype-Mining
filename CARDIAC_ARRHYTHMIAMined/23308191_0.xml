<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> with traditional sedative agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RCTs comparing the effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and traditional sedative agents during gastrointestinal endoscopy were found on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary complications (i.e., <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>) and sedation profiles were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two original RCTs investigating a total of 1,798 patients, of whom 912 received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> only and 886 received traditional sedative agents only, met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> use was associated with shorter recovery (13 studies, 1,165 patients; WMD -19.75; 95% CI -27.65, 11.86) and discharge times (seven studies, 471 patients; WMD -29.48; 95% CI -44.13, -14.83), higher post-anesthesia recovery scores (four studies, 503 patients; WMD 2.03; 95% CI 1.59, 2.46), better sedation (nine studies, 592 patients; OR 4.78; 95% CI 2.56, 8.93), and greater patient cooperation (six studies, 709 patients; WMD 1.27; 95% CI 0.53, 2.02), as well as more local pain on injection (six studies, 547 patients; OR 10.19; 95% CI 3.93, 26.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> on cardiopulmonary complications, procedure duration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, pain during endoscopy, and patient satisfaction were not found to be significantly different from those of traditional sedative agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> is safe and effective for gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures and is associated with shorter recovery and discharge periods, higher post-anesthesia recovery scores, better sedation, and greater patient cooperation than traditional sedation, without an increase in cardiopulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Care should be taken when extrapolating our results to specific practice settings and high-risk patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
