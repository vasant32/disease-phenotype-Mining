<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the use of a quadripolar left ventricular (LV) lead for cardiac resynchronization therapy and to compare its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and mid-term outcomes with those obtained with bipolar leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac resynchronization exhibits a high incidence of problems involving the LV lead when conventional leads are used, and these problems may be minimized by using multipolar leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We gathered clinical, implant, and follow-up data at 3 and 9 months from 21 consecutive patients in whom a quadripolar (Group Q) or bipolar (Group B) lead was used for a biventricular defibrillator implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The leads were successfully implanted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group B, more than one lead was used in 20% (p = 0.048) of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no clinical differences or differences in the implant parameters between the two groups except for the radiation dose, which was greater in group B (p = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of problems related to the LV lead during follow-up was higher in group B, but the difference was not significant (42.9% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.326) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of more than one LV lead was the only variable that was significantly associated with lead-related problems during follow-up (p = 0.03; OR = 10.8; 95% CI 1.07-108.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The quadripolar lead was associated with excellent implantation success rates and mid-term performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multi-programmability capabilities of quadripolar leads facilitated the achievement of implant goals and helped to reduce problems during the implant and follow-up </plain></SENT>
