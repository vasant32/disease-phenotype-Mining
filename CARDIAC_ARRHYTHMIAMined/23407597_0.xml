<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> were treated with the Mito-FLAG regimen consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50729">mitoxantrone</z:chebi> (7 mg/m(2), day 1, 3 and 5), fludarabine (30 mg/m(2), days 1-5), Ara-C (1 g/m(2), over 3 h every 12 h, days 1-5) and G-CSF [5 μg/kg/day subcutaneously from day 0 until the white blood count (WBC) was &gt;20×10(9)/l] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with a partial response (PR) received another course of the same regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a suitable donor and aged &lt;50 years received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (51%) and 3 patients (7%) achieved complete remission (CR) and PR, respectively, following one or two courses of Mito-FLAG, and the overall response (OR) rate was 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (20%) received allo-SCT and 4 patients (9%) succumbed early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematological toxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were the most prominent toxicities of this regimen </plain></SENT>
