<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an admixture of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> with regard to the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> abilities, hemodynamic parameters, and postoperative pain control and to compare the results with those obtained with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with poorly controlled, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (American Society of Anesthesiologists class II) who presented for uncomplicated upper third molar extraction were included in a double-blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action, duration, and intensity of anesthesia and the vasoconstrictor properties were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic changes (ie, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of 1 mm or greater, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of postoperative pain and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirements were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed using an unpaired, type sample equal-variance t test with the Bonferroni correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (American Society of Anesthesiologists class II), 25 received 2 mL of 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> (15 μg/mL) and 25 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (12.5 μg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the 2 agents with regard to the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of action, duration or intensity of anesthesia, or the vasoconstrictor properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> group showed better hemodynamic parameters compared with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> group showed significantly lesser postoperative pain and, therefore, had lesser <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">Clonidine</z:chebi> could be a useful and safe alternative to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> for intraoral block anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and American Society of Anesthesiologists class II </plain></SENT>
