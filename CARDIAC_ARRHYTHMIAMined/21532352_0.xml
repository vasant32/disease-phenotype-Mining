<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies of healthy children have indicated a link between autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) reactivity and health outcomes, but there is limited research on whether ANS reactivity is similar for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if ANS reactivity differs for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD) compared with a community sample of children without SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: In two cross-sectional, descriptive studies, 32 public school children without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> health problems were compared with 33 children with SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The children were 5-8 years old and they completed standardized protocols measuring ANS responses (respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and preejection period) during rest and challenge conditions in social, cognitive, sensory, and emotion domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactivity was calculated as the difference between challenge response minus rest for each domain and overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were differences in the distributions of the samples in parent education and child age, so these variables were adjusted for in subsequent analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The community sample showed parasympathetic withdrawal (low respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> scores) and greater parasympathetic reactivity (low respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> difference scores and percentage of negative scores) compared with the children with SCD in the social (p &lt; .05) and sensory (p &lt; .05) domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The children with SCD showed greater sympathetic reactivity (low preejection period difference scores) compared with the community children in the cognitive domain (p &lt; .05), and a greater percentage of children with SCD versus the community children showed negative preejection period difference scores (sympathetic reactivity) in the social domain (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The community sample, but not the children with SCD, showed changes in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> across domains (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Children with SCD may display a different pattern of ANS responses to laboratory challenges compared with children without SCD from the same community </plain></SENT>
