<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a microscopic scale, such uncoupling structures change the pattern of the electrical conduction from uniform towards complex and may play a role in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anatomical diversity of conduction structures and their topology at a microscopic size scale is overwhelming for experimental techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mathematical models have been often employed to study the behavior of the electrical propagation at a sub-cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, very fine and computationally expensive meshes are required to capture <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microscopic details found in the cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, we present a numerical technique based on the finite element method which allows to reproduce the effects of microscopic conduction barriers caused by the presence of uncoupling structures without actually resolving these structures in a high resolution mesh, thereby reducing the computational costs significantly </plain></SENT>
