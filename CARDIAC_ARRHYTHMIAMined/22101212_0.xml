<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-a-go-go related gene (hERG) encodes the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K⁺ currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of hERG K⁺ channels leads to cardiac repolarization prolongation, which contributes to either the anti-arrhythmic effects of anti-arrhythmic drugs, or the pro-arrhythmic effects (induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>) of some drugs not used for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> shows multiple beneficial effects and clinical significance, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on hERG K⁺ channels, elucidating its potential cardiac therapeutic or toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> inhibited hERG K⁺ currents in HEK293 cells stably expressing hERG channels in a dose-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ value of 5.55 μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deactivation, inactivation and the recovery time from inactivation of hERG channels were significantly changed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of 10 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incubation of 20 μM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> for 24h reduced the HEK293 cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of maximal amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in rabbits (20 mg/animal) did not affect the cardiac repolarization manifested with QTc value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> inhibits hERG K⁺ channels in vitro </plain></SENT>
