<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rate of significant conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) following surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is 2-8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative management approach in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> who are not considered candidates for AVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TAVI using the CoreValve (CV) bioprosthesis is associated with a nearly 30% rate of conduction disturbances requiring postprocedural <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To provide an initial evaluation of the rate of conduction disturbances and the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, and to analyse factors that increase the risk of this complication in patients undergoing TAVI using CV bioprosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the rate of permanent conduction disturbances in patients who underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> at one year after TAVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studies 22 initial patients in a single centre who underwent CV bioprosthesis implantation in 2009-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of 6 patients with preprocedural <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, we ultimately evaluated 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed using χ(2), Fisher, and Wilcoxon tests, and logistic regression analysis was performed using the SAS software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 8 (50%) patients in our study group required <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> after TAVI (TAVI + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>), and the remaining 8 patients did not require <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (TAVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common indication for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001709'>complete heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decision to implant a pacemaker was made on average at 9 ± 7 days following TAVI (range 3 to 22 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When we analysed risk factors for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> that were unrelated to the TAVI procedure, we found that the TAVI + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group was characterised (vs the TAVI group) by a significantly larger diameter of the native aortic valve (p = 0.03) and a larger left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) dimension in the frontal (p = 0.02) and the corresponding frontal dimension in the transverse view (p = 0.01) by computed tomography angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> increased more than 2.5 times for each increase in the aortic annulus diameter by 1 mm (OR 2.64; 95% CI 0.90-7.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the risk factors related to TAVI resulted in a significant increase in the rate of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among the patients who underwent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>, we only noted a trend for a larger valvulotomy balloon diameter (p = 0.08), shorter procedure duration (p = 0.06), and deeper CV insertion within LVOT (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, the bioprosthesis was inserted deeper in those patients who developed new <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> after TAVI (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The ECG analysis at one day after the procedure showed a significant prolongation of PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, and increased left axis deviation in the TAVI + + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, the TAVI + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group showed increased QRS duration (p = 0.03) and increased left axis deviation (p = 0.049) compared to the TAVI group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Each increase in QRS duration by 10 ms was associated with 2.5-fold increase in the risk of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.97-1.22), and each increase in PR interval duration by 10 ms with a 23% increase in risk (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.99-1.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> following CV implantation was noted significantly more frequently in the TAVI + <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> group vs the TAVI group (p 〈 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Pacemaker interrogation at one year after TAVI showed that the mean percentage of ventricular pacing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a pacemaker (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> and VVI) pacing was 41%, and it was less than 10% in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Transcatheter implantation of a CV bioprosthesis is associated with an increased risk of persistent conduction disturbances and subsequent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>New <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> after TAVI may predict the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Careful ECG monitoring is necessary for one week after CV bioprosthesis implantation due to a risk of atrioventricular conduction disturbances and the need for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Patients at an increased risk of postprocedural <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> may be those with deep bioprosthesis insertion in LVOT, larger LVOT diameter, and larger aortic annulus diameter in the frontal view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These observations require confirmation in a larger group of patients </plain></SENT>
