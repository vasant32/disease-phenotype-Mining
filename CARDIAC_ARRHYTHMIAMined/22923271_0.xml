<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Sprint Fidelis implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead was recalled in 2007 because of an levated risk of lead fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated an accelerating risk of lead failure over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to identify predictors and characterize trends of Fidelis lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 604 Fidelis leads with ≥ 90 days of follow-up implanted at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fidelis lead survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of log-log plots of cumulative hazard plots was performed to assess changes in lead failure rate over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of 3.3 ± 1.7 years, 51 (8.4%) Fidelis lead failures were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-year and 5-year Fidelis lead survival rates were 93.5% and 85.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female sex was the only significant predictor of lead failure (heart rate, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of lead failure initially increased exponentially with a power of 2.3 (95% CI, 2.22-2.43; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, log-log analysis of cumulative hazard for leads functioning at 2 and 4 years revealed a stable rate of failure of 4.5%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mathematical modeling of the Fidelis lead failure demonstrated a transition from an exponential to linear pattern of lead failure at 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After 3 years, failure rates of Fidelis leads stabilize but at a significantly elevated rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Female sex is associated with a doubling of the risk of Fidelis lead failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings have implications for Fidelis lead management decisions that are based on the prediction of lead failure risk </plain></SENT>
