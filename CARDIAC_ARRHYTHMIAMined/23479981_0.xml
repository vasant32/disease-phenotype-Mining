<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To estimate the prognostic value of the parameters of the microcirculatory bed for the assessment of risk for in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiovascular events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty (62.5%) and 18 (37.5%) of 48 patients (mean age 63.5 +/- 10.2 years) admitted to an intensive care unit for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome subsequently developed MI in the anterior and lower walls of the left ventricle (LV), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the GRACE scale, 28 (58.3%), 7 (14.6%), and 13 (18.1%) patients had high, low, and moderate risks for in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Uncomplicated MI was noted in 18 (37.5%) of the patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> LV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was formed in 12 (25%); 14 (29.1%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> as frequent ventricular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature beats</z:e>, paroxysms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and flutter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early post-infarction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> was noted in 2 (4.2%) patients, Killip Class I and II <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> in 36 (75%) and 12 (25%), respectively; 3 patients died (2 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018813" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial rupture</z:e> and 1 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to GRACE scores, complicated MI was significantly more frequently encountered in patients at high risk for in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (75% versus 28.5% in those at low risk; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the microcirculatory bed revealed substantial changes in microcirculation (MC), which reflected its hypereremic type and characterized high perfusion and high MC flow index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the coefficient of variation (CV) was significantly higher than that in the control; on days 4 and 20 it did not virtually differ from that in the control on day 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The found changes in MC parameters (MC value and CV) may suggest the higher influence of active mechanisms for regulation of vascular tone as a response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in the regulation of vascular tone is supported by the significant change in the normalized amplitudes of low- and high-frequency oscillations while the intravascular resistance index remained considerably higher at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follow-up stages, which may suggest that central hemodynamics is unstable in patients with MI and necessitates monitoring of their clinical status </plain></SENT>
