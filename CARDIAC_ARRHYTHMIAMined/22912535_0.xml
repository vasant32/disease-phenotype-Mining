<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent optical mapping of electrically active cardiac tissues provides a unique method to examine the excitation wave dynamics of underlying action potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such mapping can be viewed as a bridge between cellular level and organ systems <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, e.g., by facilitating the development of advanced theoretical concepts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the design and use of a high-speed, high-resolution optical mapping system composed entirely of "off the shelf" components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrical design integrates a 256 element photodiode array with a 16 bit data acquisition system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proper grounding and shielding at various stages of the design reduce electromagnetic interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our mechanical design provides flexibility in terms of mounting positions and applications (use for whole heart or tissue preparations), while maintaining precise alignment between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> optical components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The system software incorporates a user friendly graphical user interface, e.g., spatially recorded action potentials can be represented as intensity graphs or in strip chart format </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, this system is capable of displaying cardiac action potentials with high spatiotemporal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results from cardiac action potential mapping with intact mouse hearts are provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that this system could be readily configured to study isolated myocardial biopsies (e.g., isolated ventricular trabeculae) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We describe the details of a versatile, user-friendly system that could be employed for a magnitude of study protocols </plain></SENT>
