<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Romidepsin is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi>) approved for the treatment of both cutaneous and peripheral T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During development, a thorough assessment of cardiac toxicity was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase II single-agent non-randomized study of romidepsin was performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTCL</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> who had progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results for the first 42 patients enrolled on the NCI 1312 Phase II study of romidepsin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CTCL</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTCL</z:e> demonstrated no cardiac toxicity based on serial electrocardiograms, troponins and MUGA scans/echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac assessments reported herein confirm the safety of romidepsin among 131 enrolled patients, while supporting a role for electrolyte replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate increased an average 11 bpm following romidepsin infusion; there was no evidence of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Criteria for <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> replacement were met prior to 55% of 1365 romidepsin doses; an association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003073'>hypoalbuminemia</z:hpo> was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose a mechanism for ST segment flattening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, the most common electrocardiogram abnormalities observed: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53578">HDI</z:chebi>-induced alteration of the activity or expression of KATP channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, examination of the variants of the active transporter of romidepsin, ABCB1, demonstrated a trend towards smaller heart rate changes in the peri-infusion period among <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> compared to variant diplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in the context of appropriate attention to electrolyte levels, the data support the cardiac safety of romidepsin </plain></SENT>
