<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of transient-outward current (Ito) in Purkinje fibers (PFs) is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that DPP6 contributes to PF Ito and that its overexpression might specifically alter PF Ito-properties and repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Objective: To assess the potential role of DPP6 in PF-Ito </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Clinical data in 5 IVF-patients suggested <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-origin in the PF conducting-system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PF and ventricular-muscle (VM) Ito had similar density, but PF Ito differed from VM in having <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi>-sensitivity and slower recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DPP6-overexpression significantly increased, whereas DPP6-kockdown reduced, Ito-density and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44296">tetraethylammonium</z:chebi>-sensitivity in canine PF, but not VM-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-channel interacting Î²-subunit KChIP2, essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of transient outward current (Ito) in VM, was weakly-expressed in human PFs, whereas DPP6 and frequenin (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-1) were enriched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heterologous expression of Kv4.3 in Chinese hamster ovary (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>)-cells produced very small Ito; Ito-amplitude was greatly enhanced by co-expression with KChIP2 or DPP6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co expression of DPP6 with Kv4.3 and KChIP2 failed to alter Ito versus Kv4.3/KChIP2 alone, but DPP6 expression with Kv4.3 and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-1 (to mimic PF Ito-composition), greatly enhanced Ito versus Kv4.3/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-1 and recapitulated characteristic PF kinetic/pharmacological properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A mathematical model of cardiac PF action potentials showed that Ito-enhancement can greatly accelerate PF repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: These results point to a previously-unknown central role of DPP6 in PF Ito, with DPP6 gain-of-function selectively enhancing PF-current, and suggest that a DPP6-mediated PF early repolarization syndrome might be a novel molecular paradigm for some forms of IVF </plain></SENT>
