<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the frequency of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation left atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (NVLAA) (diverticula, accessory appendages) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation pulmonary venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (NVPVA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and to determine whether the presence of these entities is associated with an increased recurrence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cardiac MDCT images performed prior to RFCA between November 2009 and May 2011 in patients with drug-refractory AF were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence, type, and location of NVLAA and NVPVA, and outcome of RFCA were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as restoration of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six consecutive patients with a mean age of 59.8 (±9.7) years (76.1% male) underwent cardiac MDCT for anatomical planning prior to RFCA procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (30.4%) patients had NVLAA, 35% of patients had NVPVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty (65%) patients had successful RFCA: 57% of these had a NVLAA, 67% had NVPVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (35%) patients had unsuccessful RFCA: 63% of these had a NVLAA, 56% had NVPVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between the presence of NVLAA (p = 0.699), NVPVA (p = 0.197), or "NVLAA in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pulmonary venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>" (p = 0.589) and the outcome of RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of NVLAA and NVPVA appears unrelated to adverse outcome in patients undergoing RFCA for the treatment of drug-refractory AF </plain></SENT>
