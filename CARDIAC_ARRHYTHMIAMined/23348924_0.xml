<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduced Cx43 protein level in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But, the effect and mechanisms of advanced glycation end product (AGE) on Cx43 expression still remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the AGE receptor (RAGE) and Cx43 expression by immunohistochemisty in AGE-infused Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the Cx43 and RAGE levels were detected in AGE-treated cardiomyocytes by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The function of cells coupling was measured by Scrap loading dye transfer assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the AGE-infused rat hearts exhibited increased cardiac RAGE and Cx43, as well as Cx43 redistribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cultured cardiomyocytes, AGE elevated RAGE expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cx43 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were upregulated by AGE (200 mg/L, 24 h), but the gap junction function was not enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RAGE-targeted knock-down or the addition of PKC, and Erk inhibitors abolished the effect of AGE on Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AGE-RAGE system might elevate Cx43 expression in rat cardiomyocytes by activating PKC and Erk MAPK pathways, and it also enhanced Cx43 redistribution in vivo, which might contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
