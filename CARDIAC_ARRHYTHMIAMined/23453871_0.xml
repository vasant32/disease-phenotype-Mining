<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) values shortly after pacemaker (PM) implantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> have been established, however little is known about long-term HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the generic SF-36 and the PM specific Aquarel questionnaire, HRQoL was repeatedly measured during a 7.5year follow-up period in 881 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> PM recipients included in the large scale nationwide Dutch FOLLOWPACE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRQoL over time, corrected for age, gender, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and AV-synchrony, was assessed with a linear mixed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased scores both on overall SF-36 and on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 subscales were observed shortly after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although scores on SF-36 gradually declined over time, scores remained improved over the measured pre-implantation values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, scores for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subscales remained increased throughout the 7.5year observation period, except for physical functioning which showed a gradual decline several years after the initial rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, higher scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Aquarel scales were observed after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scores on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and chest discomfort subscales improved and remained stable throughout follow-up (FU), whereas the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> at exertion subscale showed a gradual decline during FU to reach pre-implantation values at 5years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased HRQoL is observed not only shortly after PM implantation, but also after long-term FU </plain></SENT>
