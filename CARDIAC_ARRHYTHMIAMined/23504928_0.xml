<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> is an antiarrhythmic drug that blocks the cardiac repolarizing current IKr ((IKr , rapid component of the delayed rectifying <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that (a) IKr is essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac function of the embryonic heart and (b) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> is teratogenic in rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> causes limb defects on gestational day 13 (GD 13) in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> (single oral dose, 5 mg/kg) on GD 13 and embryonic heart rates assessed by ultrasound (Vevo770, VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) 2 hr later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetuses were examined for malformations on GD 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a separate experiment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> treatment of GD 13 rats was followed 2, 4, 12, or 24 hr with iv dosing with the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> marker, pimonidazole (60 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embryos were collected and heart rates were assessed in vitro and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in embryo limbs analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A teratogenic dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> at a susceptible stage of development (GD 13) resulted in a period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of the embryonic heart and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the developing limbs (GD 13) resulting in limb malformations (GD 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Drugs that induce periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> of the embryonic heart and cause the embryo to become hypoxic are potential human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50905">teratogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
