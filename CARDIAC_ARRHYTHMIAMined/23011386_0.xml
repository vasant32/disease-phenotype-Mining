<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically in those with a unilateral pectoral NSD, the contralateral pectoral space is used for CIED implantation; however, in very rare occasions the patient has bilateral pectoral NSDs which makes subsequent implantation of a CIED challenging both because of placement and device interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, we introduce the case of a 68-year-old gentleman with bilateral pectoral deep brain stimulators for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> who received cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CRT-D generator was implanted in the abdomen and the CRT-D leads were placed through a minimally invasive epicardial approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both devices were tested without any evidence of device interaction </plain></SENT>
