<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Manchester Triage System is commonly used as the triage system in emergency departments of the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As per the Manchester Triage System, patients presenting with retention of urine to the accident and emergency department are categorized to yellow, which denotes that the ideal maximum time to first contact with a treating clinician will be 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cervical spinal cord injury patients, in whom urinary catheter is blocked, may develop suddenly <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, cardiac dysrhythmia, <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp>, intracranial bleed, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurogenic pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> due to a distended bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male with C-6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> because of a blocked catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was seen immediately on arrival in the spinal injuries unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The blocked catheter was removed and a new catheter was about to be inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then this patient said that the ceiling lights were very bright and glaring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five milligrams of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> was given sublingually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient started having fits involving his head, face, neck and shoulders with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 14-French <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> Foley catheter was inserted per urethra without any delay and 300 ml of clear urine was drained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This patient recovered consciousness within 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the brain revealed no focal cerebral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no intra-cranial haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that spinal cord injury patients with lesion above T-6, who develop retention of urine because of a blocked catheter, may look apparently well, but these patients can develop suddenly life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, spinal cord injury patients, who present to the accident and emergency department or spinal units with a blocked urinary catheter, should be seen urgently although their vital signs may be stable on arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increasing the awareness of staff in emergency departments regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> as well as education of the patient and carers will be useful in preventing this complication in persons with spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
