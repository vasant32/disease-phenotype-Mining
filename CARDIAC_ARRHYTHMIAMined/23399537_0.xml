<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anaesthetic</z:chebi> management differs function of etiology (primary vs. secondary or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011770'>tertiary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo>) and surgical technique (minimally invasive or classic parathyroidectomy).Objectives: To evaluate peri-operative management (focusing on hemodynamic changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and patients' awakening quality) in parathyroidectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000843'>hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> of various etiologies, in a tertiary center.Material and methods: 292 patients who underwent surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000843'>hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> between 2000-2011 were retrospectively reviewed; 96 patients (19M/77F) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008200'>primary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> (group A) and 196 (80M/116F) with secondary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011770'>tertiary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biochemical parameters (serum calcium, phosphate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) were determined by automated standard laboratory methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum intact PTH was measured by ELISA (iPTH - <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range: 15-65 pg/mL).Outcomes: Median surgery duration was 30 minutes in group A (minimally invasive or classic parathyroidectomy) and 75 minutes in group B (total parathyroidectomy and re implantation of a small parathyroid fragment into the sternocleidomastoid muscle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During anaesthesia induction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> developed significantly more frequent in group B (57 out of 196 pts, 29.1%) than in group A (8 out of 96 pts, 8.34%), p&lt;0.0001, especially in patients receiving Fentanyl-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During surgery and anaesthesia maintenance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in group A (67 out of 96 pts, 69.8%) than in group B (26 out of 196 pts, 13.3%), p&lt;0.0001, especially during searching of parathyroid glands </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the studied group regarding frequency of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>.Conclusions: <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> management in parathyroid surgery may be difficult because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0008200'>primary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> in secondary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011770'>tertiary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo>, respectively) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> during anaesthesia induction in patients with secondary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011770'>tertiary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
