<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SCN5A, encoding the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel Na(v)1.5, is the main gene involved in BrS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that several mutations have been reported in the N-terminus of Na(v)1.5, the functional role of this region remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize two BrS N-terminal mutations, R104W and R121W, a construct where this region was deleted, ΔNter, and a construct where only this region was present, Nter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293 cells demonstrated that R104W, R121W, and ΔNter abolished the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current I(Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, R104W and R121W mutations exerted a strong dominant-negative effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes revealed that both mutants were mostly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and that their co-expression with WT channels led to WT channel retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Na(v)1.5-subunits were interacting with each other, even when mutated, deciphering the mutation dominant-negative effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both mutants were mostly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, while ΔNter was addressed to the membrane, and Nter expression induced a two-fold increase in I(Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the co-expression of N-terminal mutants with the gating-defective but trafficking-competent R878C-Na(v)1.5 mutant gave rise to a small I(Na) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study reports for the first time the critical role of the Na(v)1.5 N-terminal region in channel function and the dominant-negative effect of trafficking-defective channels occurring through α-subunit interaction </plain></SENT>
