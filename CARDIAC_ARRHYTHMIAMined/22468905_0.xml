<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of white coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (WCH) to atrial conduction abnormalities by electrocardiographic P-wave analysis and echocardiographic electromechanical coupling (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>) interval measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched 24 patients with WCH, 24 patients with sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (SH), and 24 subjects with normotension (NT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difference between the maximum (Pmax) and minimum P-wave durations on 12-lead electrocardiography was defined as P-wave dispersion (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra- and inter-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> were measured by tissue Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pmax and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> of subjects with WCH were significantly higher than those of normotensives and lower than those of patients with SH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inter-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> and left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> values of WCH group were intermediate between NT and SH groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between left atrial diameter, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>, Pmax, left ventricle mass index, left atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e>, and inter-atrial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: White coat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is an intermediate group between SH and NT in terms of atrial electromechanical abnormalities which may be associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
