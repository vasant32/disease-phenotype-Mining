<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) are the two major subclasses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While VT has treatment options that can be performed in catheterization labs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> is a lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, often when detected the patient receives an implantable defibrillator which restores the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rhythm by the application of electric shocks whenever <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> is detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The classification of these two subclasses are important in making a decision on the therapy performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> real world process the boundary between VT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> is ill defined which might lead to many of the patients experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the overlap zone (that might be predominately VT) to receive shocks by the an implantable defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There may also be a small population of patients who could be treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs or catheterization procedure if they can be diagnosed to suffer from predominately VT after objectively analyzing their intracardiac electrogram data obtained from implantable defibrillator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed work attempts to arrive at a quantifiable way to scale the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> into VT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, and the overlap zone <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> as VT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> candidates using features extracted from the wavelet analysis of surface electrograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This might eventually lead to an objective way of analyzing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the overlap zone and computing their degree of affinity towards VT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A database of 24 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> tracings obtained from the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database was analyzed and wavelet-based features that demonstrated discrimination between the VT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, and VT-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> groups were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An overall accuracy of 75% in classifying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> into 3 groups was achieved </plain></SENT>
