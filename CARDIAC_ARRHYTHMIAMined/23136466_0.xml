<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (T) plays an important role in the male predominance of the clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between T levels and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in the BS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the hormonal pattern and the variation within CAG repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) gene, affecting <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> sensitivity, are associated with the Brugada ECG phenotype in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: 16 male patients with BS (mean age 45.06 ± 11.3 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12-lead ECG was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi>, free-T, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16330">dihydrotestosterone</z:chebi>, 17-β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi>, 3-alpha-androstanediol-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, delta-4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17252">17-hydroxyprogesterone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> binding globulin were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of CAG repeats on DNA extracted from leukocytes was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between hormone values and ECG parameters of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BS patients showed the CAG length normally recognized in the human polymorphism range and the number of CAG repeats did not correlate with the ECG pattern of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AR CAG repeat length does not correlate with the ECG features of the patients affected by BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The search for genes downstream AR activation as possibly responsible for the increased risk of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in BS males after puberty is warranted </plain></SENT>
