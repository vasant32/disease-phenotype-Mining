<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specific characteristics of the pathway, the fact that it seldom occurs, and ambiguities about the pathophysiology and nomenclature make it, for electrophysiologists, still difficult to ablate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a patient with anterogradely slow conducting accessory pathway, which has been effectively ablated although M potential was not observed nor was a mechanical conducting block of the accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The accessory pathway showed a wide spectrum of electrophysiological characteristics of the "AV node <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>" including inductions and terminations of atrio-ventricular replica-nodal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> by local automaticity, not only during electrophysiological study, but during successful application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accessory pathway presented signs of two types of pseudo Mahaim fibers: atrio-fascicular and slow conducting atrio-ventricular connection </plain></SENT>
