<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the frequency and factors of prolonged QT dispersion that may lead to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven healthy patients were included as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was calculated using electrocardiography, corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) and the Bazett's formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HOMA values &lt; 1 were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and values &gt; 2.5 indicated a high probability of IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prolonged QTcd was found in 12.2% of UC patients, and in 14.5% of CD patients compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found between the insulin values (CD: 10.95 ± 6.10 vs 6.44 ± 3.28, P &lt; 0.05; UC: 10.88 ± 7.19 vs 7.20 ± 4.54, P &lt; 0.05) and HOMA (CD: 2.56 ± 1.43 vs 1.42 ± 0.75, P &lt; 0.05; UC: 2.94 ± 1.88 vs 1.90 ± 1.09, P &lt; 0.05) in UC and CD patients with and without prolonged QTcd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disease behavior types were determined in CD patients with prolonged QTcd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased systolic arterial pressure (125 ± 13.81 vs 114.09 ± 8.73, P &lt; 0.01) and age (48.67 ± 13.93 vs 39.57 ± 11.58, P &lt; 0.05) in UC patients were significantly associated with prolonged QTcd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that IBD patients have prolonged QTcd in relation to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The routine follow-up of IBD patients should include determination of HOMA, insulin values and electrocardiogram examination </plain></SENT>
