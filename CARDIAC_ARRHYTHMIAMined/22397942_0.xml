<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether 7-day event triggered (tECG) ECG recording is equivalent to 7-day continuous Holter (cECG) ECG recording for AF screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Both a cECG (Lifecard CF) and a tECG (R.Test Evolution 3) were simultaneously worn for 7 days by patients with known or suspected paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 100 corresponding recordings, median effective duration of monitoring was 165 h (range 10-170 h) for cECG and 137 h (0-169 h) for tECG (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median number and total duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (AF, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) of ≥30 s duration recorded by cECG were 10 (1-428) and 1030 min (≤1-10,020), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was recorded in 42 cECGs (42%) versus 37 tECGs (37%, p=0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triggered ECG failed to record an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in cECG positive cases because of interrupted monitoring in four cases and because of recording failure in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of tECG therefore were 88%, 100%, 100%, and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative cECG analysis required a median of 20 min (3-205 min) and qualitative tECG analysis 4 min (1-20 min; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skin irritation was a frequent side effect (42%) resulting in premature removal of devices in 16% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of tECG for AF screening as compared to cECG is lower, mainly because of shorter effective monitoring duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Qualitative tECG analysis is less time consuming than quantitative cECG analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Skin irritation is a frequent side effect and reason for premature device removal </plain></SENT>
