<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels are also remarkably promiscuous with respect to drug binding, which has been a very significant problem for the pharmaceutical industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the progress that has been made in understanding the structure and function of hERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels with a particular focus on nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the domains of the hERG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel </plain></SENT>
