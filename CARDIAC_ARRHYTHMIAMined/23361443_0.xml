<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (OHCA) has been previously associated with exposure to particulate air pollution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is uncertainty about the agents and mechanisms that are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the association of gases and particulates with OHCA, and differences in pollutant effects on OHCAs due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) vs those due to other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Helsinki Emergency Medical Services provided data on OHCAs of cardiac origin (OHCA_Cardiac) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hospital and autopsy reports determined whether OHCAs were due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (OHCA_MI) or other cardiac causes (OHCA_Other) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pollutant data was obtained from central ambient monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A case-crossover analysis determined odds ratios (ORs) for hourly lagged exposures (Lag 0-3) and daily lagged exposures (Lag 0d-3d), expressed per interquartile range of pollutant level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For OHCA_Cardiac, elevated ORs were found for PM2.5 (Lag 0, 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.13) and ozone (O3) (Lag 2d, 1.18; CI: 1.03-1.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For OHCA_MI, elevated ORs were found for PM2.5 (Lag 0, 1.14; CI: 1.03-1.27; Lag 0d, 1.17; CI: 1.03-1.33), accumulation mode particulate (Acc) (Lag 0d, 1.19; CI: 1.04-1.35), NO (Lag 0d, 1.07; CI: 1.01-1.13), and ultrafine particulate (Lag 0d, 1.27; CI: 1.05-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For OHCA_Other, elevated ORs were found only for O3 (Lag 1d, 1.26; CI: 1.07-1.48; Lag 2d, 1.30; CI: 1.11-1.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results from two-pollutant models, with one of the pollutants either PM2.5 or O3, suggested that associations were primarily due to effects of PM2.5 and O3, rather than other pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that air pollution triggers OHCA via two distinct modes: one associated with particulates leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and one associated with O3 involving etiologies other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>, for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
