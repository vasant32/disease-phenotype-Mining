<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fundamental management strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no doubt that those patients at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> should be offered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is uncertain whether rhythm control (restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm) or rate control (adjustment to a physiological ventricular rate while allowing AF to continue) is the preferred primary treatment option for the reduction of symptoms and major cardiovascular (CV) outcomes associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several well conducted trials comparing the two strategies led to the conclusion that there was little to choose between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, guidelines leaned towards recommending rate control as the initial strategy, and reserved rhythm control for those who remained symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently this status quo is being increasingly challenged by the clear demonstration that left atrial catheter ablation is effective at suppressing AF resistant to traditional antiarrhythmic drugs, such as those that failed to demonstrate any superiority when compared with rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, recently introduced antiarrhythmic therapy may have superior efficacy with regard to reducing unexpected CV hospitalization, CV mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is a growing perception that atrial remodelling should be best prevented by early rhythm control rather than delaying until rate control has proven unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For these reasons the results of large randomised clinical trials, which recruit patients soon after the presentation of AF and compare 'aggressive' modern rhythm control against the guideline approach of primary rate control, are eagerly awaited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the meantime the pendulum of clinical opinion has begun to swing towards a rhythm control strategy </plain></SENT>
