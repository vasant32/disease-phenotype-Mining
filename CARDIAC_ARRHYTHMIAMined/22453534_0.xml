<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the short-term and longterm outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> ventricular septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (VSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated outcomes for VSP repair for 42 patients over 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis of clinical records, risk factors for hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and long-term survival was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 33.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A low ejection fraction and short time interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VSP were significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rates of in-hospital survivors at 5 and 10 years were 81.7% and 43.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 17 cardiac events among the survivors during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most influential factor affecting long-term outcomes was the number of diseased coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The long-term survival outcome of VSP patients during the postoperative period was comparatively good, but the prognosis of VSP patients with multivessel disease was not satisfactory because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We believe that postoperative medical treatment for preventing cardiac remodeling is important for improving long-term survival outcomes in such patients </plain></SENT>
