<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The reliable endpoint for ablation of longstanding persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (LPAF) has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 140 patients who underwent catheter ablation for drug-refractory LPAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A stepwise ablation approach included circumferential pulmonary vein isolation followed by left atrial and right atrial complex fractionated electrogram-guided ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) was terminated by radiofrequency application during catheter ablation in 95 patients (67.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 33 patients (23.6%) converted to sinus rhythm directly, whereas 62 patients (44.3%) via atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> (ATs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom AF terminated during the index procedure had a lower recurrence rate of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> than patients in whom AF did not terminate (45.3% vs 68.9%, P = 0.009, follow-up 18.7 Â± 7.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients in whom AF terminated, there was no significant difference in recurrence rate according to the termination mode, whether converted to AT or not (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, patients who converted to AT had a higher recurrence rate of AT (54.8% vs 81%; P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that termination of AF during ablation (HR 0.440; 95% CI: 0.200-0.969, P = 0.041) and structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (HR 2.633; 95% CI: 1.211-5.723; P = 0.015) were significant independent factors predicting the recurrence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Termination of AF during catheter ablation is associated with a better clinical outcome in patients with LPAF </plain></SENT>
