<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the production of arrhythmogenic substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and is considered to be promoted by the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the relationship between CTGF and ECM synthesis, and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> on these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen canine AF models were produced by rapid atrial stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into three groups: pacing control (n = 5): 6-week pacing, pacing + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> (n = 5): pacing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg/day), and non-pacing group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the pacing control group, messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> expressions of CTGF and collagen types 1 and 3 were up-regulated in comparison with the non-pacing group (P &lt; 0.05) while transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) did not exhibit a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the pacing + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group, these up-regulations were suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fluorescent immunostaining, the expression of CTGF was localized in the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein level of collagen type 3 was increased in the pacing control and it was suppressed in the pacing + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTGF and associated genes were up-regulated in the atria with the appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because this up-regulation was independent of TGF-β and suppressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi>, CTGF up-regulation was considered to be mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
