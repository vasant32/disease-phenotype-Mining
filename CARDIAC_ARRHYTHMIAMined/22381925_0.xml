<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Figulla septal occluder (FSO) is a similar device to ASO with some structural innovations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of study is to assess the maximum P-wave duration (Pmax) and dispersion (Pd) in patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> closure with both devices, to determine the effects of structural innovations on atrial electrical inhomogeneity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study is a retrospective cohort analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between December 2005 and March 2010, 121 patients underwent percutaneous closure of <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FSO was used in 79 patients, ASO in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pmax and Pd were measured on the surface electrocardiography before and soon after procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For comparison of P-wave parameters initially and after procedure paired t-test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson correlation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pmax and Pd were significantly increased immediate after procedure (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In FSO and ASO group pre/postprocedural Pd were 38.3 ± 2.7/ 44.1 ± 2.7 msec and 37.5 ± 2.5/ 50.1 ± 2.2 msec respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ASO group had a greater postprocedural Pmax and Pd (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Left and right atrial disc diameter and device size were the strongest correlates of Pd (r=0.52, p&lt;0.001; r=0.58, p&lt;0.001; r=0.35, p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moderate correlation was found between pre-intervention Pd and age (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pmax and Pd were significantly increased soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> closure procedure in both devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pd is significantly lower in patients closed with FSO device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Difference may be due to the distinctive texture of devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in terms of clinically apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after closure with both device types </plain></SENT>
