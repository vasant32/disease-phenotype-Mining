<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate long-term trends in morbidity and mortality in a national cohort of adult patients with a systemic right ventricle due to the atrial switch for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a baseline of 18 years, including life table and Kaplan-Meier analysis for probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/transplant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, surgical or percutaneous intervention, and permanent pacemaker insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 97 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch (Mustard procedure in 80/Senning procedure in 17) and 32 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median ages at latest follow-up were 29 and 34 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 40 years of follow-up, freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transplant was 0.90 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch and 0.84 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (P = .833) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at 40 years of follow-up was 0.51 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch and 0.93 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Freedom from intervention at 40 years of follow-up was 0.33 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch after initial repair and 0.53 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (P = .938) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freedom from pacemaker insertion at 40 years of follow-up was 0.77 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch and 0.62 for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011540'>congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo> (P = .161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Those patients who survive to adulthood with a systemic right ventricle experience low mortality and good functional status up to 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there is a substantial burden of atrial tachyarrhythmia, and this occurs significantly earlier in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>-atrial switch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Management of atrial tachyarrhythmia, along with systemic right ventricular dysfunction and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0006046'>atrioventricular valve regurgitation</z:mp>, is likely to be the major challenge for this group of patients over the next decade </plain></SENT>
