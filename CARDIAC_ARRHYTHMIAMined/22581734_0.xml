<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: The ATP and HUT identify distinct subsets of patients with neurally mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> and its A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) may be implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> in patients with positive HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nothing is known about the purinergic profile of patients with positive ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND MEASURES: This prospective study includes a consecutive series of patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent both HUT and ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before testing, samples were collected for measurement of baseline <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> plasma level (APL) and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (25 men and 21 women) with a mean age of 57Â±18 years were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HUT test was positive in 27 patients and the ATP test in 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both tests were positive in 9 and negative in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High APL was associated with high probability of positive HUT while low APL was associated with high probability of positive ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of A(2A)R was lower in patients with positive ATP than in those with positive HUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NMS</z:e> present different purinergic profiles and that responses to HUT and ATP are correlated with these profiles </plain></SENT>
