<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about prevalence and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo> (ECG) recordings in these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive patients (≥ 18 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (≥ 3 months) non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> pain were examined prospectively using ECG recordings and a questionnaire [German Pain Society (DGSS); further questions] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at the first and next two follow-up outpatients' clinic appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation rate was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 26% had an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp>, while 5% of these patients had an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> first at the follow-up when consuming a different <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings were QTc prolongation (16%), ventricular block (7%), artrioventricular block (6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> recordings should be considered in the pain management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General ECG screening in this population should be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future studies should examine a larger population to identify potential risk factors (e.g., medication) </plain></SENT>
