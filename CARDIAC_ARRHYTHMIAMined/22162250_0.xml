<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiographic features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were compatible with left-ventricular outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular-tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The life-threatening event was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or an electrolyte disorder and was not drug-induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A probable cause was the irritation of the myocardium by the prosthetic valve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware that the presence of anatomical parameters that increases the risk for myocardial injury and the need for pacemaker implantation might indicate an increased risk of a tachyarrhythmic episode </plain></SENT>
