<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the incidence and prognostic significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA) in ambulatory continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients from November 1, 2006 through December 31, 2010 with an LVAD and implantable cardioverter defibrillator that survived to discharge from the LVAD implantation admission were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up began from date of discharge with both devices in situ and ended with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, transplant, on June 1, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-LVAD VA history was related to the primary endpoints of post-LVAD VA, mortality, and the combined endpoint of post-LVAD VA/mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 622 days 19 patients (31%) experienced VA (14 episodes of VT, 5 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-LVAD VA was predictive of post-LVAD VA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91, P = 0.026) and the combined post-LVAD VA/mortality endpoint (HR 2.70, P = 0.021) but only displayed a nonsignificant association with mortality (HR 2.30, P = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, pre-LVAD VA remained a significant predictor of post-LVAD VA (HR 2.84, P = 0.03) and the combined post-LVAD VA/mortality endpoint (HR 2.65, P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-LVAD VA was the strongest univariate predictor of mortality (HR 13.92, P &lt; 0.001) and remained so after multivariate adjustment (HR 9.69, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-LVAD VA occurred at a mean of 1 year from mortality events with 45% within 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pre-LVAD VA is a significant predictor of post-LVAD VA but not of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VA in the continuous flow LVAD population carries a significant risk of mortality often within the first month </plain></SENT>
