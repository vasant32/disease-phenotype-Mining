<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protective effects of nicorandil on paclitaxel-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> by examining flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were investigated in anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 7-day osmotic infusion of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg per day), FMD was measured by high-resolution ultrasound in the femoral artery of living rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paclitaxel significantly reduced FMD (21.6% ± 3.2% to 7.1% ± 1.7%); this reduction was prevented by co-treatment with nicorandil (15 mg/kg per day), while paclitaxel did not affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi>-induced vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">Diazoxide</z:chebi> and tempol, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6061">isosorbide dinitrate</z:chebi>, had an effect similar to nicorandil in preventing paclitaxel-induced decrease in FMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil significantly prevented paclitaxel-induced reduction in <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-induced vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the underling mechanisms, paclitaxel increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (dihydrorhodamine 123, DCF fluorescence intensity) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase (p47(phox), gp91(phox) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in arteries and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), while paclitaxel reduced nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) release (DAF-2 fluorescence intensity), but not endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in HCAECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nicorandil prevented the increased ROS production in arteries and HCAECs, which was 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>)-sensitive but <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29300">1H-</z:chebi>[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ)-resistant, without significant effect on the reduced NO release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, nicorandil prevents paclitaxel-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, which may be brought by improved NO bioavailability due to the reduction of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> via K(ATP) channel activation </plain></SENT>
