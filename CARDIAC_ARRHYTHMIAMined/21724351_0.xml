<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the insertion of central venous catheters for hemodialysis using angiographic techniques in patients with previous multiple catheterizations in terms of efficacy of the procedure and early complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, the vascular access team of our hospital placed 409 central venous catheters in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed using the Seldinger blind technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 (4.4%) cases it was impossible to advance the guidewire, and so the patients were transported to the angiography suite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the angiographic technique, the guidewire was advanced in order to position the central venous catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter was inserted into the subclavian vein in 12 (66.6%) cases, into the internal jugular vein in 4 (22.2%) and into the femoral vein in 2 (11.1%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was only one complicated case with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 1 (5.5%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that insertion of central venous catheters using angiographic techniques in hemodialysis patients with previous multiple catheterizations is a safe and effective procedure with few complications and high success rates </plain></SENT>
