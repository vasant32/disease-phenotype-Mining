<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a technique using double access into the left ventricle for multipolar electroanatomic mapping and ablation of scar-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Double access into the left ventricle was obtained via transseptal technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endocardial mapping was performed via the first transseptal sheath using a steerable duodecapolar catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher density mapping was performed in areas of dense scar (&lt;0.5 mV) and border zone (0.5-1.5 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> late potentials (LPs) observed on the 20 poles were tagged and pacemapping was performed at these sites for comparison with the clinical or induced VT 12-lead template </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If VT was hemodynamically tolerated, entrainment mapping was attempted at sites demonstrating diastolic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation was performed through the second transseptal sheath with an open-irrigated catheter at target sites identified by LPs, pacemapping, and/or entrainment on the duodecapolar catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results: Seventeen patients (88% ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>) underwent electroanatomic mapping and ablation with double transseptal access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of endocardial mapping points was 819 ± 357 with an average mapping time of 31 ± 7 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean number of VTs induced was 2.8 ± 1.6, mean cycle length 418 ms ± 101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LPs were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during endocardial mapping with the duodecapolar catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Good (56%) and perfect (44%) pacemaps were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients when performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Concealed entrainment, guided by the earliest diastolic activity seen on the duodecapolar catheter, was demonstrated in 4 patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was achieved in 94% of patients with complete success in 47% and partial success in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The intermediate success rate (free of VT recurrence) was 69%, with an average follow-up of 8 ± 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Mapping and ablation of scar-mediated VT using a multipolar catheter results in ultra high-density delineation of the left ventricular substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A novel double ventricular access strategy has the potential to facilitate identification of LPs, pacemapping, and entrainment mapping </plain></SENT>
