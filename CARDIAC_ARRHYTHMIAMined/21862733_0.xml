<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> are considered good epidemiological indicators of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients, the link between elevated afterload and AF remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated atrial remodeling and the substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in a surgical model of elevated afterload in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar rats (aged 3-4 weeks) were anesthetized and subjected to either partial stenosis of the ascending aorta (AoB) or sham operation (Sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed on excised hearts 8, 14, and 20 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unipolar electrograms were recorded from the left atrial epicardial surface of perfused hearts using a 5Ã—5 electrode array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cryosections of left atrial tissue were retained for histological and immunocytochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to Sham, AoB hearts showed marked left atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> at 14 and 20 weeks postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence and duration of pacing-induced AF was increased in hearts from AoB rats at 20 weeks postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was associated with reduced vectorial conduction velocity and greater inhomogeneity in conduction but without changes in effective refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Left atrial expression of the gap junction protein, connexin43, was markedly reduced in AoB compared with Sham hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using a small-animal model, we demonstrate that elevated afterload in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> results in increased inducibility of AF and left atrial remodeling involving <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, altered atrial connexin43 expression, and marked conduction abnormalities </plain></SENT>
