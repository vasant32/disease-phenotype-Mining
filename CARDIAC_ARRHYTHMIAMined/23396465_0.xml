<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted at the Emergency Command Center of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China from June to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental group of 113 trainees, and the control group of 85 trainees received training in pre-hospital emergency care (PHEC) theory and practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were given pre- and post- tests to evaluate their knowledge and skill levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The training content was the same and the teaching methods, materials and training team in the 2 groups were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> trainees were tested for emergency knowledge and skills, before and immediately following the training, and also a survey was conducted regarding the effectiveness of the training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-test was used to measure the difference between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The post-test scores for both groups in knowledge and skills were higher than that of the pre-test (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of difference between the post-test scores of each group in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> control, wound care, fracture care and stabilization, and transportation (BWFT) (p&lt;0.001), and intubation (p&lt;0.001) was significantly higher in the experimental group except emergency knowledge, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> treatment (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the survey, 95.6% of the trainees in the experimental group considered the Union Training Program a more effective way to help paramedics learn emergency medical knowledge and skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of the American standard of PHEC can improve the emergency skills of Chinese paramedics, especially in the areas of BWFT and intubation, and support its use province-wide in an effort to standardize the PHEC medical procedure in China </plain></SENT>
