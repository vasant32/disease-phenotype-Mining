<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intramural distribution of myocardial hyperenhancement and its correlation with clinical symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and cardiac function have not been described forsymptomatic apical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the features and significance of myocardial hyperenhancement on DE-MRI insymptomatic apical HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with symptomatic apical HCM and their 65 apical segments were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocardial hyperenhancement and regional and global functional parameters were determined with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the intramural distribution and frequencies of this myocardial hyperenhancement and compared them with the patients' clinical symptoms, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and cine MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight (61.5%) patients with symptomatic apical HCM displayed apical myocardial hyperenhancement, and 22 (33.8%) of the 65 apical segments examined showed myocardial hyperenhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the myocardial hyperenhancement observed, 81.8% showed a subendocardial pattern.The hyperenhanced apical myocardium had a lower percentage of systolic myocardial thickening, and was associated with serious symptoms (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with symptomatic apical HCMshowed myocardial hyperenhancement involving the subendocardial layer, which might be related to regional systolic dysfunction, serious clinical symptoms, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
