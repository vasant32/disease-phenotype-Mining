<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of ivabradine applied in heart transplant (HTx) recipients with permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (PST) has been depicted in previous short-term follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the long-term impact of ivabradine in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From May to November 2006, 29 HTx recipients with PST, who exhibited either contraindications or intolerance of beta-blocker medication or insufficient heart rate (HR) reduction on beta-blocker treatment, first received oral ivabradine treatment (5 mg bid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine treatment was discontinued in three patients due to adverse events within the first week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 26 patients, resting HR was significantly lowered from 106.8 ± 9.2 at baseline to 83.2 ± 5.1 bpm after 3 months (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect remained stable in the long-term follow-up (82.1 ± 11.8 bpm after 4 years), whilst blood pressure was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apart from the corrected QT interval (QTc), there were no significant changes in ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The elongated QTc at baseline (469.4 ± 29.5 ms) decreased to 444.3 ± 33.1 ms after 3 months ivabradine treatment (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A decrease in QTc until month 9 was observed, followed by a partial increase to the upper limit of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither allograft rejection nor changes in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed over the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ivabradine appears to be a safe and feasible long-term therapeutic option for HTx recipients with PST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It reduced the resting HR without impairment of blood pressure, myocardial contractility and cardiac conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of normalised QTc following ivabradine administration requires further observation </plain></SENT>
