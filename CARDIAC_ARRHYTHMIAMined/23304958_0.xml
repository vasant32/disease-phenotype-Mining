<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is well established in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However there is limited literature for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occuring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No such case had been described in South East Nigeria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This report highlights a case of ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in an elderly Nigerian woman with reemergent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e>, without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: A 75- year old retired female teacher presented with a painless <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goiter</z:hpo> of 3 years duration and right sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> of 2 months duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She had sub-total thyroidectomy 32 years ago for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> with subsequent good outcome and had been managed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> for 13 years with good glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She was not a known hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She was thyrotoxic on examination with a large non-tender <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goiter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She had a right sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015464" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facial nerve palsy</z:e> and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011099'>spastic hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sensations were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results of investigations confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> while brain CT scan was unremarkable except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>She had no other associated risk factor associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Within two weeks of admission she was stabilized on anti-thyroid and anti-diabetic medications, her motor functions significantly recovered and she was independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>She was discharged to be followed up at the out-patients' clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may present in hyperthyroid patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This possibility needs to be entertained despite the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> or other well established factors for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There is a need for more studies on this relationship </plain></SENT>
