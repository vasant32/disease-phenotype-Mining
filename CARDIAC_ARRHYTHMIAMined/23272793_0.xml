<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This controlled movement of ions is particularly important for the action potentials of excitable cells such as cardiac myocytes and therefore essential for timely beating of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inherited mutations in ion channel genes and in the genes encoding proteins that regulate them can cause lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> either by direct channel disruption or by altering interactions with therapeutic drugs, the best-understood example of both these scenarios being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unsurprisingly, mutations in the genes encoding ion channel pore-forming Î± subunits underlie the large majority (~90%) of identified cases of inherited LQTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>Given that inherited LQTS is comparatively rare in itself (~0.04% of the US population), is pursuing study of the remaining known and unknown LQTS-associated genes subject to the law of diminishing returns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, with a particular focus on the KCNE family of single transmembrane domain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel ancillary subunits, the significance to cardiac pharmacogenetics of ion channel regulatory subunits is discussed </plain></SENT>
