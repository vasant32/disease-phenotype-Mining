<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in the registry with regard to their characteristics, risk factors and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to calculate adjusted HRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: The Kyoto prefecture of Japan has established a registry to enrol new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in cooperation with the Kyoto Medical Association and its affiliated hospitals PARTICIPANTS: The registry now has data on 14 268 patients enrolled from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 12 774(89.5%) underwent CT, 9232 (64.7%) MRI, 2504 (17.5%) angiography and 342 (2.4%) scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding 480 (3.3%) unclassified patients, 13 788 (96.6%) patients formed the basis of further analyses which were divided into three subtypes: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI), cerebral haemorrhage (CH) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13 788 confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in the study cohort comprised 9011 (86.3%) CI, 3549 (25.7%) CH and 1197 (8.7%) SAH cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age ±SD was 73.3±11.8, 69.1±13.6 and 62.7±13.5 in the CI, CH and SAH cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Men were predominant in the CI and CH cases, whereas women were predominant in the SAH cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of risk factors were different among the subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality was worst in SAH, followed by CH, and least in CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HRs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> adjusted for age, sex, histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipaemia</z:e> and use of tobacco and/or alcohol showed a significant (p&lt;0.001) difference among CI (as reference), CH (3.71; 3.11 to 4.43) and SAH (8.94; 7.21 to 11.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics, risk factors and mortality were evaluated in a quantitative manner in a large Japanese study cohort to shed light on the present status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> medicine </plain></SENT>
