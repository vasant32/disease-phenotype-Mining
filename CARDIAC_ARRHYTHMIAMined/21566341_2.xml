<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 625 consecutive patients with symptomatic, drug resistant I-VA (315 males and 310 females; mean age, 54 ± 17 years; 218 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo>, 407 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo>) who underwent catheter ablation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into 5 groups based on the VA origin: (1) outflow tract (OT)-VA, consisting of right ventricular (RV) OT-VA and left ventricular (LV) OT-VA; (2) inflow tract (IT)-VA, consisting of tricuspid annulus (TA)-free wall (FW)-VA, IT-septum-VA, and mitral (MA)-FW-VA; (3) LV-inferoseptum-VA; (4) LV-other-VA; and (5) RV-other-VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RVOT-VA in women were 1.5 times more frequent than in men, while LVOT-VA were more frequent in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of LVOT origin I-VA increased with age compared to that for the RVOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of MA-FW-VA patients (62 ± 14 years) was higher than that of TA-FW-VA patients (51 ± 18 years; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ablation success rate for RVOT-VA (88%) was higher than that for LVOT-VA (58%; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis revealed that the patient age was one of the valuable predictors of a successful ablation (odds ratio=0.97; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-0.99; P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Distinct gender and age differences were found in the incidence of I-VA according to their site of origin </plain></SENT>
