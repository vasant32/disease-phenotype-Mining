<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumors</z:mpath> has been increasingly used across the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether treatment-related morbidity has remained low with broader adoption is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to describe in-hospital morbidity associated with RFA for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumors</z:mpath> and to identify predictors of adverse events in a nationally representative database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the 2006-2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients aged ≥40 years who underwent an elective RFA for primary or metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> (N = 1298) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included in-hospital procedure-specific and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify patient and facility predictors of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most patients underwent a percutaneous (39.9 %) or laparoscopic (22.0 %) procedure for metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> (57.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Procedure-specific complications were frequent (18.2 %), with transfusion requirements (10.7 %), intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (4.3 %), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> (2.8 %) being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.93 (1.23-3.04)], <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> [AOR = 4.65 (2.95-7.34)], and an open surgical approach [AOR = 2.77 (1.75-4.36)] were associated with an increased likelihood of procedure-specific complications, whereas hospital RFA volume ≥16/year was associated with a reduced likelihood [AOR = 0.59 (0.38-0.91)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications were also common (12.0 %), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, and open surgical approach acting as significant predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital morbidity is common after RFA for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumors</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While several patient factors are associated with more frequent procedure-specific complications, treatment at hospitals with an annual volume ≥16 cases/year was associated with a 41 % reduction in the odds of procedure-specific complications </plain></SENT>
