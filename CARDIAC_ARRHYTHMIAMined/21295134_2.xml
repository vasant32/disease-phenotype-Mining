<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the source of increased myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production and the role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in sympathetic innervation remain to be further characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats, after coronary artery ligation, were randomized to vehicle, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> for 4weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> in sympathetic reinnervation, we also used 3-morpholinosydnonimine (a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> generator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857175" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postinfarction</z:e> period was associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, as measured by myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>, nitrotyrosine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase activity, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity, and dihydroethidium fluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurement of myocardial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> levels revealed a significant elevation in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic hyperinnervation was blunted after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic scores in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi>-treated infarcted rats were significantly lower than those in vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For similar levels of ventricular remodeling, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> had no beneficial effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, sympathetic hyperinnervation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi>-treated hearts had significantly decreased nerve growth factor expression, which was substantially increased after coadministration of 3-morpholinosydnonimine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase largely mediates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
