<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: control (CTL, n=15) group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, n=15) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was induced by injecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (300 µg×kg(-1) ×d(-1)) for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four weeks later, cardiac function and structure change of both groups were assessed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the whole Langendorff-perfused hearts, the monophasic action potential (MAP) and the effective refractory period (ERP) were recorded from left anterior basal ventricle, left anterior free wall, left anterior apex and left posterior basal ventricle, left posterior free wall and left posterior apex, the APD curves were also constructed in both groups; at the six sites of every isolated heart, the programmed electrical stimulation and burst pacing were used to induce action potential duration (APD) alternans and VA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Left ventricular ejection was reduced and end-dimension was enlarged in rabbits of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the same sites of CTL group, the 90% of MAP duration (MAPD90), the ERP, the max slope (Smax) of APDR curves, the pacing cycle length of inducing the APD alternans and the VAs were significantly increased (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> group; the spatial dispersions of MAPD90, ERP and Smax of APDR curves in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> group were also greater than in CTL group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ventricular APD alternans might be linked with occurrence of the VA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increase of the Smax from APDR curves and the spatial dispersions of Smax in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> model might facilitate the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
