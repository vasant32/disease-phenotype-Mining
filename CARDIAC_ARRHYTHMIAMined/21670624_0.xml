<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiac telemetry as a diagnostic tool is widely used in hospitals because of an increased severity of illness and complex modality of treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QTc interval abnormalities in the electrocardiogram have been long recognized as a predictive precursor for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has also been recognized as a reliable marker to prevent cardiac events in outpatient settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the QTc and QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> as electrocardiogram predictors are not routinely assessed in daily practice for hospitalized patients because of the slow advancement of technology in bedside monitoring systems and inadequate staff preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the role of QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and QTc interval assessment in predicting risk of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The article also explores the need for further research and advancement in technology to overcome barriers to integrating these predictors into routine nursing practice </plain></SENT>
