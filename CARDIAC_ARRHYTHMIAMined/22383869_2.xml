<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due to electrical, structural, and contractile remodeling processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated mechanisms of how electrical and structural remodeling contribute to perpetuation of simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, using a mathematical model of the human atrial action potential incorporated into an anatomically realistic three-dimensional structural model of the human atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical and structural remodeling both shortened the atrial wavelength--electrical remodeling primarily through a decrease in action potential duration, while structural remodeling primarily slowed conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in wavelength correlates with an increase in the average duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dependence of reentry duration on wavelength was the same for electrical vs. structural remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the dynamics during atrial reentry varied between electrical, structural, and combined electrical and structural remodeling in several ways, including: (i) with structural remodeling there were more occurrences of fragmented wavefronts and hence more filaments than during electrical remodeling; (ii) dominant waves anchored around different anatomical obstacles in electrical vs. structural remodeling; (iii) dominant waves were often not anchored in combined electrical and structural remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, in simulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the wavelength dependence of reentry duration is similar for electrical and structural remodeling, despite major differences in overall dynamics, including maximal number of filaments, wave fragmentation, restitution properties, and whether dominant waves are anchored to anatomical obstacles or spiralling freely </plain></SENT>
