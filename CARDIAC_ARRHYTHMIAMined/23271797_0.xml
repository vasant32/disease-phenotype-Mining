<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the electromechanical profile of cardiomyocytes from 26 HCM patients undergoing myectomy compared with those from nonfailing nonhypertrophic surgical patients by performing patch-clamp and intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, HCM cardiomyocytes showed prolonged action potential related to increased late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> (I(NaL)) and Ca(2+) (I(CaL)) currents and decreased repolarizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents, increased occurrence of cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, prolonged Ca(2+)(i) transients, and higher diastolic Ca(2+)(i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such changes were related to enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity and increased phosphorylation of its targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine at therapeutic concentrations partially reversed the HCM-related cellular abnormalities via I(NaL) inhibition, with negligible effects in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By shortening the action potential duration in HCM cardiomyocytes, ranolazine reduced the occurrence of early and delayed afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, as a result of the faster kinetics of Ca(2+)(i) transients and the lower diastolic Ca(2+)(i), ranolazine accelerated the contraction-relaxation cycle of HCM trabeculae, ameliorating diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We highlighted a specific set of functional changes in human HCM myocardium that stem from a complex remodeling process involving alterations of CaMKII-dependent signaling, rather than being a direct consequence of the causal sarcomeric mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the several ion channel and Ca(2+)(i) handling proteins changes identified, an enhanced I(NaL) seems to be a major contributor to the electrophysiological and Ca(2+)(i) dynamic abnormalities of ventricular myocytes and trabeculae from patients with HCM, suggesting potential therapeutic implications of I(NaL) inhibition </plain></SENT>
