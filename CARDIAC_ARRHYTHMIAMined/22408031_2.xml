<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This paper describes our clinical experience of using an entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) in children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maintaining lead integrity and long-term vascular access are critical challenges of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, especially in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> has considerable theoretical advantages in selected patients without pacing indications, particularly children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although sensing in an S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> may be influenced by age, pathology, and posture, there are currently few published data on clinical sensing performance outside the setting of intra-operative testing or in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were selected by a multi-disciplinary team on clinical grounds for S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation from a broad population at risk of sudden arrhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients underwent implantation [median age 20 years (range 10-48 years)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve had primary electrical disease and four had congenital structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no operative complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) induction testing was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During median follow-up of 9 months (range 3-15 months), three children required re-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen clinical shocks were delivered in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten shocks in four patients were inappropriate due to T-wave over-sensing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Within the eight shocks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, three were delivered for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, among which two had delays in detection with time to therapy of 24 and 27 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The S-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> is an important new option for some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, these data give cause for caution in light of the limited published data regarding clinical sensing capabilities, particularly among younger patients </plain></SENT>
