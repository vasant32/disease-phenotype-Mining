<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transfusion therapy, however, causes progressive iron loading, which, if untreated, results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endocrinopathies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001395'>hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo>, and premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Iron chelation therapy is used to prevent iron loading, remove excess accumulated iron, detoxify iron, and reverse some of the iron-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> have undergone extensive testing to date: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi>, and deferiprone (although the latter drug is not currently licensed for use in North America where it is available only through compassionate use programs and research protocols) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> differ in their modes of administration, pharmacokinetics, efficacy with regard to organ-specific iron removal, and adverse-effect profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differential properties influence acceptability, tolerability and adherence to therapy, and, ultimately, the effectiveness of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chelation therapy, therefore, must be individualized, taking into account patient preferences, toxicities, ongoing transfusional iron intake, and the degree of cardiac and hepatic iron loading </plain></SENT>
