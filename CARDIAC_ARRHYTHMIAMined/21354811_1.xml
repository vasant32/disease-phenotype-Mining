<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the long-term period after Fontan operation, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was one of the important factors to decide the postoperative quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the impact of Fontan conversion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery and pacemaker therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients underwent Fontan conversion using extracardiac conduit from 1992, and 22 patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> underwent maze procedure simultaneously using cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation and epicardial <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> pacemaker implantation and 16 patients had regular 'sinus' rhythm before Fontan conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period was 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative clinical course were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average weight, age at Fontan conversion, and years after first Fontan operation were 49.0 kg, 25.8 years old, 14.7 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen percent of patients were in New York Heart Association class I (NYHA I), and 74% of patients were in NYHA II, and 7% were in NYHA III, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Except three early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, actual survival rate at 1 year and 5 years were 80% and 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In survivors, 80% of the patients obtained regular heart rhythm including artificial pacemaker rhythm, although only 43% of the patients had regular 'sinus' rhythm before the Fontan conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative average cardiothoracic ratio and oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were 50% and 94%, and 74% of patients were in NYHA I and 26% were in NYHA II, respectively, after Fontan conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mid-term results of Fontan conversion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery and pacemaker therapy were acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Restoration of regular rhythm might improve the postoperative NYHA status and the activity of the daily life </plain></SENT>
