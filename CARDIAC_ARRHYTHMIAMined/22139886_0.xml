<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The single-procedure efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is less than optimal in patients with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive techniques have been developed to enhance single-procedure efficacy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to compare 3 ablation strategies in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were randomized as follows: arm 1, PVI + ablation of non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> triggers identified using a stimulation protocol (standard approach); arm 2, standard approach + empirical ablation at common non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> AF trigger sites (mitral annulus, fossa ovalis, eustachian ridge, crista terminalis, and superior vena cava); or arm 3, standard approach + ablation of left atrial complex fractionated electrogram sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were seen at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year; transtelephonic monitoring was performed at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued at 3 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary study end point was freedom from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> off antiarrhythmic drugs at 1 year after a single-ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 156 patients (aged 59±9 years; 136 males; AF duration, 47±50 months) participated (arm 1, 55 patients; arm 2, 50 patients; arm 3, 51 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedural outcomes (procedure, fluoroscopy, and PVI times) were comparable between the 3 arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More lesions were required to target non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> trigger sites than a complex fractionated electrogram (33±9 versus 22±9; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was achieved in 71 patients and was worse in arm 3 (29%) compared with arm 1 (49%; P=0.04) and arm 2 (58%; P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that additional substrate modification beyond PVI does not improve single-procedure efficacy in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
