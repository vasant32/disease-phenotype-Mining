<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potential recordings showed that 2 mM heptanol induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in the absence of triggered activity arising from early or after-depolarizations during regular 8 Hz pacing and programmed electrical stimulation (PES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also increased activation latencies and ventricular effective refractory periods (VERPs), but did not alter action potential duration (APD), thereby reducing local critical intervals for re-excitation given by APD(90) - VERP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bipolar electrogram recordings showed that 2 mM heptanol increased electrogram duration (EGD) and ratios of EGDs obtained at the longest to those obtained at the shortest S1S2 intervals studied during PES, suggesting increased dispersion of conduction velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings show, for the first time in the mouse heart, that slowed conduction induces reversible arrhythmogenic effects despite repolarization abnormalities expected to reduce arrhythmogenicity </plain></SENT>
