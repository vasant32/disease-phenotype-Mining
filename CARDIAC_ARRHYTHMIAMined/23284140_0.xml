<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined temporal trends in RFA utilization on a nationwide scale in Denmark.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the cross-linkage of nationwide registers, 3302 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients treated with 'first-ever' RFA between 2000 and 2009 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 53-65) and 73.8% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 2000-01 to 2008-09 the median age increased from 55 (48-61) to 61 (55-66) years (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> increased from 34.8 to 50.6% (P &lt; 0.0001) and 2.2 to 5.9% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> or previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score â‰¥2 increased from 23.9 to 41.5% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients who did not receive any class Ic or class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) within 2 years prior to 'first-ever' RFA increased from 8.7 to 22.7% (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior use of sotalol and class Ic AADs decreased from 63 to 6.3% (P &lt; 0.0001) and from 35 to 24% (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> and beta-blockers prior to RFA were used in 36 and 82% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, respectively, without significant temporal changes.CONCLUSION: During a 10-year period, RFA was increasingly performed in older patients with higher co-morbidity, and without prior trial of antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may provide a framework to understand the outcomes of RFA </plain></SENT>
