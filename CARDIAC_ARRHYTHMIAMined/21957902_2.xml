<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel Kv7.1 is expressed in the heart, where it contributes to the repolarization of the cardiac action potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Kv7.1 is expressed in epithelial tissues playing a role in salt and water transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that surface-expressed Kv7.1 is internalized in response to polarization of the epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line and that this was mediated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the pathway downstream of PKC, which leads to internalization of Kv7.1 upon cell polarization, is elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show by confocal microscopy that Kv7.1 is endocytosed upon initiation of the polarization process and sent for degradation by the lysosomal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internalization could be mimicked by pharmacological activation of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) using three different AMPK activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the downstream effector of AMPK is the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we show that AMPK activation results in a downregulation of Kv7.1 currents in Xenopus oocytes through a Nedd4-2-dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, surface-expressed Kv7.1 channels are endocytosed and sent for degradation in lysosomes by an AMPK-mediated activation of Nedd4-2 during the initial phase of the MDCK cell polarization process </plain></SENT>
