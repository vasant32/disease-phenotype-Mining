<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the challenges of managing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through a case that demonstrates a possible association between catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, a genetically determined severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> disorder that often presents as either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="1391">3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine</z:chebi> ("Ecstasy") combined with marijuana, which are often considered safe drugs by users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 15-yr-old male collapsed suddenly after ingesting an unknown substance and smoking marijuana </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was successfully resuscitated by first-responder chest compressions and rescue breaths along with a single 100-J shock by paramedics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was intubated and transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial cardiac workup was negative but severe instability on vasopressors and a family history of intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> in his brother raised suspicion for catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of the unknown substance required coordination with a toxicology laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The patient had extremely labile cardiovascular responses to vasopressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 5, his blood pressure was stable and he was extubated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A full cardiac workup, including a catheterization (preadmission to pediatric intensive care unit), electrocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were done to screen out most structural arrythmogenic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A specific genetic test for catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was sent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patient's methylenedioxymethamphetamine blood level was 87 ng/mL approximately 12 hrs after ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the 3-8 hr half-life of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, it is likely that levels were toxic at the time of ingestion (&gt;110 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Marijuana may have provided a synergistic critical <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release to trigger an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing showed a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor-2 mutation that was consistent with catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While an initial cardiac workup for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be negative, family history may be a simple, essential component of patient management and disease diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates a possible association between methylenedioxymethamphetamine, marijuana, and catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genetic and structural arrythmogenic disorders should be considered when working up a patient with presumed toxin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
