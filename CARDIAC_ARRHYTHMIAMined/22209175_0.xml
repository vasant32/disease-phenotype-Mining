<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> during pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) may be related to the position of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of patients' positions on incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and the time required to place the pulmonary artery catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the study group (n = 70), patients were positioned with their head down at 10° first and then 10° up and tilted right laterally when the PACs were passed from the right atrium to the right ventricle and then the right ventricle to the pulmonary capillary wedge position, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group (n = 70), patients remained in a supine position during pulmonary artery catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULT: During the catheterization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were recorded and classified into benign (1-3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo>) and severe (more than 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> or nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The time for PACs to pass from the right atrium to the right ventricle and the right ventricle to the pulmonary capillary wedge position was measured as T1 and T2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> between groups was not significantly different (49% for study and 34% for control group, p = 0.196), whereas the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly higher in the control group (20% v 5.8%, p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The time used for each technique (T1 and T2) in both groups was not significantly different (p = 0.362 and 0.468, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient in the study group was excluded because of difficulty in passing the catheter from the right atrium to the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting patients in the head-up and right lateral position while passing the PAC can reduce the incidence of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but not in the time taken to place it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This position may have clinical implications, particularly in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
