<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients referred for device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> in a tertiary referral hospital in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had device closure of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001684'>secundum atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) from June 1999 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and echocardiographic data at the time of implantation and follow-up is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 176 patients were referred for shunt closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a significant shunt defined as a shunt with right heart <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and/or a shunt ratio of at least 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority were female (67%) and the average age was 36.5 ± 22.7 years; age range 3-84 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average hospital admission time was 2.5 ± 1.7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up occurred at 3.7 ± 3.6 months for the first follow-up and 26.3 ± 18.2 months (range 3 months-7.8 years) for the long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline echocardiogram findings showed the majority had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> left ventricular ejection fraction (99%); average LVEF=63.2 ± 7.2% while the right ventricle was dilated in 61% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedure information: The average procedure time was 94.8 ± 36.4 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural imaging was performed using Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in 107 cases (61%); Intracardiac Echocardiography (ICE) in 69 (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Device use was as follows: Amplatzer=156 cases, Helex=18, and Starflex=2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure shunt assessment by transthoracic echocardiography showed successful closure (no shunt or trivial shunt) in 99% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients were referred for inpatient surgery due to a significant residual shunt in one case and an unstable device in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient who had an unstable device had their device repositioned successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was the most common complication occurring in the peri-implantation period in 12 cases (6%) with four further cases at final up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005133'>right ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> in 65% patients at baseline had improved significantly at the first and long term follow-up to 2% (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001684'>secundum atrial septal defects</z:hpo> in this large Australian cohort demonstrates a high procedural success rate with a low incidence of complications in the short and long term </plain></SENT>
