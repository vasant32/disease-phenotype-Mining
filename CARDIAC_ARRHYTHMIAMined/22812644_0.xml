<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We present an easily implementable method for measuring Fura-2 fluorescence from isolated mouse hearts using a commercially available switching light source and CCD camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After calibration, it provides a good estimate of intracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>] with both high spatial and temporal resolutions, permitting study of changes in dispersion of diastolic [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>], <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient dynamics, and conduction velocities in mouse hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a proof-of-principle study, we imaged isolated Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts with reversible regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Isolated mouse hearts were perfused in the Landendorff-mode and loaded with Fura-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearts were then paced rapidly and subjected to 15 minutes of regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, following which the ligation was removed to allow reperfusion for 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at regular intervals using a high-speed CCD camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two wavelengths of excitation light were interleaved at a rate of 1 KHz with a computer controlled switching light source to illuminate the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fura-2 produced consistent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transients from different hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ligating the coronary artery rapidly generated a well defined region with a dramatic rise in diastolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> without a significant change in transient amplitude; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> handling normalized during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conduction velocity was reduced by around 50% during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and did not recover significantly when monitored for 15 minutes following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our method of imaging Fura-2 from isolated whole hearts is capable of detecting pathological changes in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> levels in cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The persistent change in the conduction velocities indicates that changes to tissue connectivity rather than altered intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> handling may be underlying the electrical instabilities commonly seen in patients following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
