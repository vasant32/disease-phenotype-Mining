<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Atrio-ventricular conduction disease is a common feature in Mendelian rhythm disorders associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> and is characterized by prolongation of the PR interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of the PR interval is also a strong predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the most prevalent sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the significant genetic component in PR duration variability, the genes regulating PR interval duration remain largely elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here aimed to dissect the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for PR interval duration that we previously mapped in murine F2 progeny of a sensitized 129P2 and FVBN/J cross </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the underlying gene responsible for this QTL, genome-wide transcriptional profiling was carried out on myocardial tissue from 109 F2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression QTLs (eQTLs) were mapped and the PR interval QTL was inspected for the co-incidence of eQTLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further determined the correlation of each of these transcripts to the PR interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tnni3k was the only eQTL, mapping to the PR-QTL, with an established abundant cardiac-specific expression pattern and a significant correlation to PR interval duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genotype inspection in various inbred mouse strains revealed the presence of at least three independent haplotypes at the Tnni3k locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of PR interval duration and Tnni3k <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels in six inbred lines identified a positive correlation between the level of Tnni3k <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PR interval duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J mice overexpressing hTNNI3K, and in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>.AKR.hrtfm2 congenic mice, which harbor the AKR/J "high-Tnni3k expression" haplotype in the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J genetic background, PR interval duration was prolonged as compared to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2J <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice ("low-Tnni3k expression" haplotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data provide the first evidence for a role of Tnni3k in controlling the electrocardiographic PR interval indicating a function of Tnni3k in atrio-ventricular conduction </plain></SENT>
