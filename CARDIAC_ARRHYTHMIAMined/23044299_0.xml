<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of home monitoring system on the early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and inappropriate shock in daily clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation with or without the home monitoring system from June 2010 to October 2011 at our center were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was scheduled after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data relating to the home monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> were retrieved using a remote transmitter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data relating to the other devices were obtained during scheduled follow-up or unscheduled visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study involved 69 patients (mean age (68.4 Â± 17.6) years, 64.3% males, 26 in the home monitoring group vs. 43 in the non-home monitoring group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 561 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes were detected in 17 patients (39.5%) in the non-home monitoring group: 495 episodes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and 66 episodes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>; among these, 476 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and 45 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> were appropriately diagnosed (96.1% and 68.2%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the home monitoring group, 389 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> episodes were transmitted by the home monitoring system in nine patients (34.6%): 348 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> episodes and 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Device detection was appropriate in 348 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> episodes (100.0%) and 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes (87.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The home monitoring group showed a higher appropriate detection rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proportion of inappropriate shock was comparable in the two groups (6/11 in the non-home monitoring group vs. 1/7 in the home monitoring group; P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The home monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was able to provide information relating to inappropriate detection and shock earlier than conventional devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It proved to be a reliable tool and has a strong potential to provide greater reaction time in the case of inappropriate shock </plain></SENT>
