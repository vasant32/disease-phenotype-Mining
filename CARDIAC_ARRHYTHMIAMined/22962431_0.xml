<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>Supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) is one of the most common conditions requiring emergent cardiac care in children, yet its management has never been subjected to a randomized controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of the 2 most commonly used medications for antiarrhythmic prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in infants: digoxin and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of infants &lt;4 months with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> (atrioventricular reciprocating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> or atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>), excluding Wolff-Parkinson-White, comparing digoxin with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> requiring medical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to recurrence and adverse events were secondary outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients completed the study, 27 randomized to digoxin and 34 to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> recurred in 19% of patients on digoxin and 31% of patients on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (P=0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No first recurrence occurred after 110 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 6-month recurrence-free status was 79% for patients on digoxin and 67% for patients on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (P=0.34), and there were no first recurrences in either group between 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no serious adverse events related to study medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> recurrence in infants treated with digoxin versus <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The current standard practice may be treating infants longer than required and indicates the need for a placebo-controlled trial </plain></SENT>
