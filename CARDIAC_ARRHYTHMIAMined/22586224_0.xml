<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the role of ROS in the generation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves during β-AR stimulation in rabbit ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoproterenol</z:chebi> (ISO) increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient amplitude during systole, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> load and the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves during diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects, however, developed at different time points during ISO application.While SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> release and load reached a maximum level after 3 min, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves occurred at the highest frequency only after 6 min of ISO application.Measurement of intra-SR-free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentration ([<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]SR) showed an initial increase of SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> load followed by a gradual decline over time during ISO application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This decline of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>]SR was not due to decreased SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> uptake, but instead was the result of increased SRCa2+ leak mainly in the form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ISO application led to significant RyR phosphorylation at the protein kinase A (PKA)-specific site, which remained relatively stable throughout β-AR activation.Moreover, β-AR stimulation significantly increased ROS production after 4–6 min of ISO application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROS scavenger Tiron and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase mimetic MnTBPA abolished the ISO-mediated ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mitochondria-specific <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> Mito-Tempo and an inhibitor of the electron transport chain, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28201">rotenone</z:chebi>, also effectively prevented the ISO-mediated ROS production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Scavenging ROS during ISO application decreased the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves and partially prevented augmentation of SRCa2+ leak, but did not affect the increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of myocytes with ISO for 15 min significantly reduced the free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> content in RyRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production during β-AR stimulation causes RyR oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together with RyR phosphorylation, oxidation of RyRs increases diastolic SR <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> leak to a critical level leading to the generation of arrhythmogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> waves </plain></SENT>
