<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was designed as a cross-sectional performance and evaluated only patients with ejection fraction less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>O2 mean consumption was 6.27±4.9 ml/kg/min at rest and 9.48±3.38 at anaerobic threshold (AT) exceeding 13 ml/kg/min in maximum which was significantly more than the expected levels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study could not find any statistical correlations between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> max and participants' ergonomic factors such as age, height, weight, BMI, as well as EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study showed no significant correlation between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi> max and maximum heart rate (HR max), although O2 maximum consumption was rationally correlated with expiratory ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This means that the patients achieved maximum ventilation through exercise in this study, but failed to have their maximum heart rate being led probably by HF-induced brady-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or deconditioning of skeletal muscles </plain></SENT>
