<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no information about HRT in healthy dogs and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to compare the HRT in healthy Boxers dogs with Boxers with mild and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001682'>subaortic stenosis</z:hpo> (SAS), to disclose the relationship between HRT and specific echocardiographic parameters and to evaluate if HRT can be used as a prognostic value in dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study revealed significantly lower values of turbulence <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (TO) and turbulence slope (TS) HRT dogs with SAS (TO = -0.76 +/- 2.6, TS = 7.1 +/- 3.21) in compared with healthy dogs (TO = -7.45 +/- 9.72, TS = 14.33 +/- 8.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TO values correlated with the left ventricular mass (LVM)/body mass factor (r = 0,32; p = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained it can be stated that dogs with SAS have a compromised baroreceptor response, which can influence the mortality of the animals with described <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
