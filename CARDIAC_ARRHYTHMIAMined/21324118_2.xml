<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo>(HF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>(AF) frequently coexist in the same patient and are associated with increased mortality and frequent hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the concomitance of AF and HF is often associated with a poor prognosis, the prompt treatment of AF in HF patients may significantly improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: Recent implantable cardiac resynchronization (CRT) devices allow electrical therapies to treat AF automatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TRADE-HF (trial registration: NCT00345592; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) is a prospective, randomized, double arm study aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of an automatic, device-based therapy for treatment of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp>(AT/AF) in patients indicated for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study compares automatic electrical therapy to a traditional more usual treatment of AT/AF: the goal is to demonstrate a reduction in a combined endpoint of unplanned hospitalizations for cardiac reasons, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from cardiovascular causes or permanent AF when using automatic atrial therapy as compared to the traditional approach involving hospitalization for symptoms and in-hospital treatment of AT/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: CRT pacemaker with the additional ability to convert AF as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> may play a simultaneous role in rhythm control and HF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value of the systematic implantation of CRT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> with the capacity to deliver atrial therapy in HF patients at risk of AF has not yet been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TRADE-HF study will assess in CRT patients whether a strategy based on automatic management of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> might be a valuable option to reduce the number of hospital admission and to reduce the progression the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> to a permanent form </plain></SENT>
