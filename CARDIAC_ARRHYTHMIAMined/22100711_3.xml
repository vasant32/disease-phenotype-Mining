<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reduced expression of connexin43 (Cx43) and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel (Nav1.5) and increased expression of collagen (<z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>) are important determinants of impulse conduction in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the importance and interaction of these factors at very low Cx43 expression, inducible Cx43 knockout mice with and without inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) were compared through electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) mice were induced with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> and killed after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epicardial activation mapping was performed on Langendorff-perfused hearts, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vulnerability was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice were divided into arrhythmogenic (VT+; n = 13) and nonarrhythmogenic (VT-; n = 10) animals, and heart tissue was analyzed for Cx43, Nav1.5, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VT+ mice had decreased Cx43 expression with increased global, but not local, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of Cx43 than did VT- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nav1.5-immunoreactive protein expression was lower in VT+ than in VT- mice, specifically at sites devoid of Cx43 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> were similar between VT- and VT+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>QRS duration was increased and epicardial activation was more dispersed in VT+ mice than in VT- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The effective refractory period was similar between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Premature stimulation resulted in a more severe conduction slowing in VT+ than in VT- hearts in the right ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Separate patch-clamp experiments in isolated rat ventricular myocytes confirmed that the loss of Cx43 expression correlated with the decreased <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in Cx43 expression and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> downregulation of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-channel protein expression and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current leads to slowed and dispersed conduction, which sensitizes the heart for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
