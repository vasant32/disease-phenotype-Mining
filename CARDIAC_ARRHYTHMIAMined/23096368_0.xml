<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, including flecainide, propafenone, sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, have several limitations in terms of efficacy and tolerability, and have made new drug development crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, intensive research was undertaken to find new pharmacological options for the treatment of AF, and two new drugs are now available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vernakalant is an atrial-selective drug specifically designed to block <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels at the atrial level, and its intravenous formulation has recently been recommended for approval by the Food and Drug Administration for pharmacological conversion of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> is a chemical derivative of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (though having a significantly different clinical profile) with effects on multiple ion channels that proved effective in reducing the rate of the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause and cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with non-permanent AF enrolled in the ATHENA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The available evidence on the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> has led to approval for recommendation in many clinical situations in which rhythm control is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the mechanisms underlying AF and the large variability of associated comorbidities render the AF patient a unique entity, making the identification of patients who may benefit from these novel approaches challenging </plain></SENT>
