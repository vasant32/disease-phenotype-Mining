<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- Median estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressures (ePAD) were calculated every 24 hours in 378 subjects with New York Heart Association functional class II-III <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> who had at least 60 days of hemodynamic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six subjects experienced 140 VT/VF events on 80 unique study days in which daily median ePAD was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of days with VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> events was significantly higher when the daily median ePAD for a subject was elevated, defined as &gt;1 SD above that subject's average median ePAD for the whole study: (2.8 episode days per patient-year compared with 1.7 episode days per patient-year; P=0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of days with VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> events was not significantly different on days when ePAD was &gt;25 mm Hg compared with days when ePAD was &lt;25 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 378 subjects, the risk of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> increased with average median ePAD calculated over the whole follow-up period (odds ratio, 1.072 for a 1-mm Hg increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.023-1.124; P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- There is significant positive association between average daily median ePAD and risk for VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, elevated intracardiac pressures are associated with higher VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> risk only when the definition of increased pressure is subject specific </plain></SENT>
