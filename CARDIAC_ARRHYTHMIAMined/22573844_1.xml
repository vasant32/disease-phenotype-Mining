<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>hERG1 activators are being developed as treatments for acquired or genetic forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The locations of the putative binding pockets for activators are still being elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In silico docking of the activator 1,3-bis-(2-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)-<z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> (NS1643) to an S1-S6 transmembrane homology model of hERG1 predicted putative binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictions of the in silico docking guided subsequent in vitro mutagenesis and electrophysiological measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The novel interacting site for NS1643 is predicted around Asn629 at the outer mouth of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The applied N629H mutation is the sole amino acid replacement in the literature that abrogates the NS1643-induced left shift of the V(1/2) of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both N629T and N629D showed pharmacologic responses similar to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another important interacting pocket is predicted at the intracellular surface in the S4-S5 linker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis of the residues critical to interactions in this pocket had major effects on the pharmacologic response to NS1643 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inward conductance elicited by hyperpolarization of D540K hERG1 was abrogated by NS1643 treatment, suggesting that it alters the inward movement of the S4 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neighboring E544L mutation markedly exaggerated tail-current responses to NS1643 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, an L564A substitution inhibited drug response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Structure-guided mutagenesis identified widespread clusters of amino acids modulating drug-induced shifts in inactivation; such modulation may reflect allosteric changes in tertiary structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Model-guided mutagenesis led to the discovery of a range of novel interacting residues that modify NS1643-induced pharmacologic responses </plain></SENT>
