<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing utilisation of interventional electrophysiology in adults and older children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, there are few data reflecting the safety and efficacy of this procedure in the age group under 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: We describe our experience in assessing the efficacy and safety with this group of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants under 2 years of age who underwent an interventional electrophysiology procedure between 1995 and 2009 to determine indications, procedural details, short- and long-term success, and complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 23 interventional electrophysiology procedures were performed in 17 patients initially under 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common indication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> resistant to pharmacological agents (59%), with the remaining cases being <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> complicated by cardiovascular instability (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was initial success in 15 patients after the first procedure, with early recurrence in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following six repeat procedures, there was long-term success in 15 patients (88%), with three repeat procedures being performed after 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one non-procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related to persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were three minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, cryotherapy was used successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The interventional electrophysiology procedure is a viable therapeutic option in infants under 2 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> resistant to other conventional medical management </plain></SENT>
