<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The current study aims to explore the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> on the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and its possible mechanism after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 24 rabbits were divided into three groups: the sham operation group (SHAM), the MI group, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> group (RAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were subjected to thoracotomy under <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> conditions; the MI and RAM groups underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the second day after surgery, the RAM group was given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rabbits in each group were fed for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The monophasic action potentials of the epicardium, mid-myocardium and endocardium in each group were, respectively, recorded before the MI and at 12 weeks after the MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005141'>episodes of ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) induced by procedure stimulations were counted, and the changes in L-type Ca flux (Ica-L) were recorded by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The episodes of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> were decreased in the RAM group after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 weeks after MI, the transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) in the MI group was prolonged significantly compared with the SHAM and RAM groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The density of Ica-L in the MI group was significantly lower than that any other group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">Ramipril</z:chebi> manifestly decreases the incidence of VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> after MI in rabbits, and the mechanism may be associated with its inhibitory effect on electrical remodeling after MI </plain></SENT>
