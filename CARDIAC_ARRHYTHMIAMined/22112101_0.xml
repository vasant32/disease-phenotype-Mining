<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current methods of monitoring lesion formation are indirect and unreliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheter to image endocardial wall in actively beating hearts through percutaneous access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reported the first in vivo intracardiac OCT imaging through percutaneous access with a thin and flexible OCT catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is a critical step toward image-guided RFA in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cone-scanning forward-viewing OCT catheter was advanced into beating hearts through percutaneous access in four swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OCT catheter was steered by an introducer to touch the endocardial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We are able to acquire high quality OCT images in beating hearts, observe the polarization-related artifacts induced by the birefringence of myocardium, and readily evaluate catheter-tissue contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observations indicate that OCT could be a promising technique for in vivo guidance of RFA </plain></SENT>
