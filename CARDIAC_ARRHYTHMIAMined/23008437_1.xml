<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients and families successfully adjust to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, but optimal care pathways may require additional psychosocial attention to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients and particularly those experiencing psychosocial distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This state-of-the-science report was developed on the basis of an analysis and critique of existing science to (1) describe the psychological and quality-of-life outcomes after receipt of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> and describe related factors, such as patient characteristics; (2) describe the concerns and educational/informational needs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients and their family members; (3) outline the evidence that supports interventions for improving educational and psychological outcomes for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients; (4) provide recommendations for clinical approaches for improving patient outcomes; and (5) identify priorities for future research in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal of this statement is to improve the precision of identification and care of psychosocial distress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients to maximize the derived benefit of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
