<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared early and late clinical outcomes in patients with IAD vs spontaneous (non-IAD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 2008, 251 patients from 4 academic medical centers underwent repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>; of those, 11 had IAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 72 ± 9 years for patients experiencing IAD and 59 ± 13 years for those with non-IAD (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with IAD were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p = 0.003) and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates for major morbidity, operative mortality, and 5-year actuarial survival were compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative mortality was not adversely influenced by IAD (27% IAD vs 17% non-IAD, p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the rates of reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (10% IAD vs 20% non-IAD, p = 0.69), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (18% IAD vs 18% non-IAD, p ≥ 0.99), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> (9% IAD vs 22% non-IAD, p = 0.47) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 5-year survival was 64% for IAD patients vs 73% for non-IAD patients (p = 0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAD does not adversely influence early outcomes and actuarial 5-year survival of patients with type A dissection </plain></SENT>
