<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The atria contribute 25% to ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and are the site of the commonest <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initiation of contraction in the atria is similar to that in the ventricle involving a systolic rise of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are, however, substantial inter-species differences in the way systolic Ca(2+) is regulated in atrial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences are a consequence of a well-developed and functionally relevant transverse (t)-tubule network in the atria of large mammals, including humans, and its virtual absence in smaller laboratory species such as the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Where t-tubules are absent, the systolic Ca(2+) transient results from a 'fire-diffuse-fire' sequential recruitment of Ca(2+) release sites from the cell edge to the centre and hence marked spatiotemporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of systolic Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the well-developed t-tubule network in large mammals ensures a near synchronous rise of [Ca(2+)]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to synchronizing the systolic rise of [Ca(2+)]i, the presence of t-tubules in the atria of large mammals, by virtue of localization of the L-type Ca(2+) channels and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger antiporters on the t-tubules, may serve to, respectively, accelerate changes in the amplitude of the systolic Ca(2+) transient during inotropic manoeuvres and lower diastolic [Ca(2+)]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the presence of t-tubules and hence wider cellular distribution of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger may predispose the atria of large mammals to Ca(2+)-dependent delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs); this may be a determining factor in why the atria of large mammals spontaneously develop and maintain AF </plain></SENT>
