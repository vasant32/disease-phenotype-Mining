<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With increasing coronary sinus (CS) pacemaker leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy, the need to remove these leads has risen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to describe a single center's experience with CS lead removal and to attempt to identify predictors of difficulty with lead removal and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> percutaneous endocardial CS lead removals performed at our institution through February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful removal with traction alone was considered simple while complex extractions required traction devices and/or laser sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between December 1996 and February 2010, 125 CS leads were percutaneously removed ≥1 week post-implantation from 115 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One attempt at CS lead extraction was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average duration since implantation for the CS leads was 1.54 years (± .75 years, range 8 days to 8.24 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the leads were removed by simple traction (n = 114, 91.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remainder were removed by femoral approach with snare (n = 3, 2.4 %), locking stylet (n = 2, 1.6 %), or locking stylet and laser sheath (n = 6, 4.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Half of CS leads in place greater than 4 years required complex extraction (n = 7/14, 50 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CS complications (n = 11 patients, 8.8 %) included CS or tributary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 7/102, 6.9 %) and CS dissection (n = 4/102, 3.9 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major non-CS complications (n = 2 patients, 1.6 %) included a cardiac tear requiring pericardiocentesis and thoracotomy (n = 1, 0.8 %) and subclavian vein tear requiring surgical repair (n = 1, 0.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Minor non-CS complications (n = 9 patients, 7.2 %) included a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> (n = 1, 0.8 %), <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n = 2, 1.6 %), subclavian vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 3, x%), and blood transfusion (n = 5, 4.0 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A longer duration since implantation and larger lead diameter were associated with complex versus simple removal (p &lt; .0001 and p = .0009 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous CS lead removal is successful by simple traction alone in the vast majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CS leads in place greater than 4 years, however, often require complex extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Specific extraction techniques can be implemented when simple traction is unsuccessful without an appreciable increase in complications </plain></SENT>
