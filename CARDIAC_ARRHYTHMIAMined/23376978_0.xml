<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, efficacy and safety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment in ChD remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to compare clinical outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in ChD and non-ChD patients.METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consists of patients who received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in a tertiary Reference Center for ChD in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of the study was appropriate therapy (appropriate shocks or anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing); the secondary endpoint was the event-free survival defined as absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hundred thirty-five patients were followed for the median time of 266 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients had ChD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy occurred in 32 (49.2%) ChD and in 19 (27.1%) non-ChD patients (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>Ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> occurred in 27 (42%) ChD and in 16 (23%) non-ChD (P = 0.01) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference in event-free survival between the group of patients with and without ChD (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median event-free survival was 230 days (95% confidence interval, CI: 113-347) in patients with ChD and 549 days (95% CI: 412-687) in non-ChD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Chagas disease</z:e> double the risk of the patient to have appropriate therapy (hazard ratio, HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.3, P = 0.02) and appropriate therapy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, P = 0.01) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (11.8%) with 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in each group and five inappropriate shocks (3.7%) with one in ChD patients (1.6%).CONCLUSION: The higher frequency of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and the shorter event-free survival in ChD patients are consistent with the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate that characterizes this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
