<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>Pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (PH) is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, and lung vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immature myeloid cells are found in the lungs of humans and animals with PH, and we hypothesized that they would be increased in the blood of patients with PH compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six children with PH and 10 undergoing cardiac catheterization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five milliliters of fresh blood were analyzed using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed using magnetic bead sorting and immunofluorescence, while quantitative polymerase chain reaction and intracellular <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> concentration assays were used as measures of MDSC arginase-1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Flow cytometry demonstrated enrichment of circulating MDSCs among patients with PH (n = 26; mean, 0.271 × 10(6) cells/mL ± 0.17; 1.86% of CD45(+) population ± 1.51) compared with control subjects (n = 10; mean, 0.176 × 10(6) cells/mL ± 0.05; 0.57% of CD45(+) population ± 0.29; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher numbers of circulating MDSCs correlated to increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.510, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with PH, female patients had a twofold increase in MDSCs compared with male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the results of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay results for arginase-1 and measurement of intracellular <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> concentration revealed increased activity of MDSCs from patients with PH compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Circulating activated MDSCs are significantly increased in children with PH compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of these cells is warranted, and we speculate that they might play significant immunomodulatory roles in the disease pathogenesis of PH </plain></SENT>
