<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics, and the predictors of TICMP in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study population consisted of 249 consecutive patients (148 F/101 M, 45 ± 20 y/o) with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and/or VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TICMP was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤50% in the absence of any detectable underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> and improvement of LVEF ≥15% following effective treatment of index <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen (6.8%) patients had TICMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with TICMP compared to patients with preserved LVEF were more likely to be male (65% vs 39%, P = 0.043) and asymptomatic (29% vs 9%, P = 0.018), and were more likely to have higher <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> burden (29.4 ± 9.2 vs 8.1 ± 7.4, P &lt; 0.001), persistence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> throughout the day (65% vs 22%, P = 0.001), and repetitive monomorphic VT (24% vs 0.9%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> burden of 16% by ROC curve analysis best separated the patients with TICMP compared to patients with preserved LVEF (sensitivity 100%, specificity 87%, area under curve 0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TICMP was relatively common (∼1 in every 15 patients) in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The predictors of TICMP were male gender, absence of symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> burden of ≥16%, persistence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> throughout the day, and the presence of repetitive monomorphic VT </plain></SENT>
