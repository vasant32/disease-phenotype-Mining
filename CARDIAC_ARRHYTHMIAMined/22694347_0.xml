<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Nonaccidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> are often the result of a combination of factors including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> and unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine if there is an association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and nonaccidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the records of 442 consecutive patients &gt;65 years old who presented to the Emergency Department at the University of Utah Medical Center with a complaint of fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two-hundred eleven patients presented with nonaccidental fall, 231 patients with accidental fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with nonaccidental fall were more likely to be older, have a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, and taking five or more medications when compared to patients with accidental fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar prevalence of sinus rhythm at presentation, the prevalence of a history of AF was significantly higher in patients with nonaccidental fall compared to patients with accidental fall (26% vs 15%; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for clinically and statistically significant predictors with a multivariate logistic regression analysis, AF, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>, and age ≤81 years were independent predictors of nonaccidental fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients ≤81 years old (median age), the risk of nonaccidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> was 2.5 times greater in patients with a history of AF when compared to those without a history of AF (odds ratio = 2.53 [confidence interval 95% 1.3-5], P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AF is an independent risk factor for nonaccidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results emphasize the need to screen for AF in patients presenting with nonaccidental fall </plain></SENT>
