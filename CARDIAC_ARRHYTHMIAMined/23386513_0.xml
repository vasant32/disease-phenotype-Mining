<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we explore the expression of Satb2 thoroughly by immunohistochemistry in the adult mouse central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Besides the cerebral cortex, we found that Satb2 is specifically expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, lateral hypothalamic area, arcuate nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, rostral periolivary region, and parabrachial nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double immunostaining showed that Satb2 is exclusively expressed in the excitatory neurons of neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, Satb2 is specifically expressed in A12 group of hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons and in serotonergic neurons in the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results present a comprehensive overview of Satb2 expression in the adult brain and provide insights for studying the role of Satb2 in the mature <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
