<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An association between ER and VTAs in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-segment elevation MI (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a single-center retrospective case-control design, 50 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> complicated by VTAs (cases), defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, or nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> within 72 hours of the index hospitalization, were matched for age and gender with 50 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> without VTAs (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms obtained an average of 1 year before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> were analyzed for ER pattern, defined as notching or slurring of the terminal QRS complex or J-point elevation &gt;0.1 mV above baseline in â‰¥ 2 contiguous leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher prevalence of ER was associated with VTAs overall in cases compared to controls (26% vs 4%, p = 0.01) and localized to anterior (16% vs 0%) and inferior (14% vs 2%, p = 0.07) leads but not lateral limb leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notching (10% vs 2%, p = 0.1) and J-point elevation (16% vs 0%) were more common in cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slurring was uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ER was associated with VTAs (odds ratio [OR] 6.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 28.8, p = 0.01), even after adjustment for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase-MB (OR 9.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 53.4, p = 0.01) and ejection fraction (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 27.1, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ER is associated with VTAs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> even after adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinas-MB levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Larger prospective studies exploring potential associations and mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmogenesis with ER pattern are needed </plain></SENT>
