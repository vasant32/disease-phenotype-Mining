<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The electronic records of patients with sudden-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, life-threatening critical respiratory events during <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> therapy for postoperative pain were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Critical respiratory event data were identified from the hospital risk management database between 8/1/2000 and 7/31//2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients required rescue treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi>, endototracheal intubation, or cardiopulmonary resusucitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pediatric patients were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to the event description (type of <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, opioid dose, patient monitoring data, time of day, and time from surgery), each patient's record was reviewed to extract co-morbidities and outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Over the 6-year period, 32 patients experienced a postoperative critical respiratory event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six events and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within the first 24 hours of opioid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of 32 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo>, cardiac dysrhythmia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significant associations in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The first 24 hours after commencing opioid-based <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> therapy represents a high risk period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo>, deep levels of sedation, nocturnal presentation, and postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> were seen in patients who died as a result of these critical respiratory events </plain></SENT>
