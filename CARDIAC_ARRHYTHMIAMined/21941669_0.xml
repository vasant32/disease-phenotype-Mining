<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> depends on the type and duration of the baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and specially on the ablation technique which was used during the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been repeatedly reported that the more extensive the left atrial surface ablated, the higher the incidence of organized atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exact origin of the pathologic substrate of these trachycardias is not fully understood and may result from the interaction between preexistent regions with abnormal electrical properties and the new ones resultant from radiofrequency delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a clinical point of view these atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> tend to remit after a variable time but in some cases are responsible for significant symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A precise knowledge of the most frequent types of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, of their mechanisms and components is necessary for a thorough electrophysiologic characterization if a new ablation procedure is required </plain></SENT>
