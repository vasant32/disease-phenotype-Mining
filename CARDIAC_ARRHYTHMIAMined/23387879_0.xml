<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The type and mechanism of induced atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, their relationship to the underlying atrial substrate, and prognostic significance of induced organized atrial a'rrhythmias are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients (30 women; median age 60 years; 54% with paroxysmal AF) undergoing AF ablation (circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation of nonvein triggers on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi>) were evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent a standardized postablation induction protocol from the coronary sinus and right atrium: 15 beat burst pacing at 250 milliseconds and decrementing to 180 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sustained rhythms were defined as greater than 2 minutes Of 144 patients, 55 patients (38.2%) did not have sustained inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two (36.1%) had inducible AF and 37 (25.7%) had inducible organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR 2.10 per decade; P = 0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 4.15; P = 0.009) were predictive of inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, inducibility of either AF or organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was not prognostic of clinical recurrence at 1 year postablation (P = 0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inducibility of organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> did not predict clinical recurrence of an organized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only LA size (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.02-4.67; P = 0.04) and persistent AF (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.09-5.40; P = 0.03) predicted atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multisite atrial burst pacing post-AF ablation induced organized rhythms in 25.7% and AF in 36.1% of patients after AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and age predict inducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, but inducibility did not predict clinical recurrence in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing organized atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> from AF did not yield any further prognostic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The utility of aggressive stimulation protocols after AF ablation for prognosis and to guide therapy appears limited </plain></SENT>
