<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, particularly during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238015" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic dysreflexia</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520539" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive episodes</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may be partly due to impaired autonomic control of the heart after SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The interval between the peak and end of the T-wave of the electrocardiograph (ECG) provides an index of transmural dispersion of repolarisation, a factor underlying the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another ECG-based risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is variability in the QT segment, the QT variability index (QTVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, P-wave variability may be correlated with risk for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We aimed to: (1) determine whether there are abnormalities in these parameters at rest in those with SCI; (2) determine correlations between these ECG parameters and severity of autonomic impairment after SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ECG intervals were determined using customised software from a 15Â min ECG recording (lead II) in 28 SCI subjects and 27 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autonomic severity of SCI was determined from sympathetic skin responses, low frequency systolic blood pressure variability, and plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T(peak)-T(end) variability and QTVI were increased in those with autonomically complete SCI compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>P-wave variability was increased in SCI individuals compared to controls, and was negatively correlated with plasma <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The higher T(peak)-T(end) variability, QTVI and P-wave variability in individuals with SCI could be markers of severity of injury to cardiac autonomic (sympathetic) pathways after SCI, and may represent new risk assessment parameters for predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
