<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Myocardial scar detected using cardiovascular myocardial resonance imaging with late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (CMR-LGE) is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its use is constrained due to limited availability, unlike electrocardiogram (ECG) which is widely available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selvester QRS scoring detects scar, although the reported performance varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study aims were to determine whether QRS score (a) detects scar (b) varies with scar characteristics, and (c) can meaningfully predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>.METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 64 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients (age 66 ± 11 years, 80% male, median left ventricular ejection fraction 30%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> who had undergone CMR-LGE prior to device implantation, over 4 years in a single centre (2006-2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified QRS score was measured on the ECG performed prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical end points were (i) appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy and (ii) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QRS score was associated with CMR scar (r = 0.42, P = 0.001) and scar surface area (r = 0.41, P = 0.001), but not subendocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strongest correlation was seen in those patients with transmural scar only (r = 0.62, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During 42 ± 13 months follow-up, QRS score was not predictive of appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy, but was significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.16; confidence interval = 1.03-1.30; P = 0.01).CONCLUSION: QRS scoring performed best in quantifying transmural scar, and shows association with medium-term mortality risk, but not with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be that the score is best suited as a risk stratifier of those with least potential to benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
