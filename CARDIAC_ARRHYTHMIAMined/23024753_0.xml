<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been associated with an increased risk of cardiopulmonary mortality and <z:mp ids='MP_0003929'>decreased heart rate variability</z:mp> (HRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether coke oven emissions (COEs) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="33848">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAHs</z:chebi>) are associated with HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our goal in the present study was to investigate the association of exposure to COEs and the urinary metabolite profiles of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAHs</z:chebi> with HRV of coke oven workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> soluble matter, <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18422">sulfur dioxide</z:chebi>, particulate matters, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAHs</z:chebi> at different workplaces of a coke oven plant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined 10 urinary <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> metabolites and HRV indices of 1333 workers using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a 3-channel digital Holter monitor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results showed that there was a significant COEs-related dose-dependent decrease in HRV, and an inverse relationship between the quartiles of urinary 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">hydroxynaphthalene</z:chebi> and five HRV indices (p(trend)&lt;0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for potential confounders, elevation per interquartile range (IQR) (1.81 µg/mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) of urinary 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">hydroxynaphthalene</z:chebi> was associated with a 5.46% (95% CI, 2.50-8.32) decrease in standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As workers worked more years, SDNN gradually declined in the same quartiles of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">hydroxynaphthalene</z:chebi> levels (p(trend) = 1.40×10(-4)), especially in workers with the highest levels of 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">hydroxynaphthalene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to COEs is associated with a dose-response decrease in HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, increased exposure to 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">hydroxynaphthalene</z:chebi> is associated with significantly decreased HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increase of working years and exposure levels has resulted in a gradual decline of HRV </plain></SENT>
