<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Prolonged <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> use has been linked with poor clinical outcomes, including higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to identify characteristics that may be predictive of prolonged arginine vasopressin (AVP) use for 7 days or more in patients with septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective nested cohort analysis of adult patients receiving AVP as initial hemodynamic support for septic shock, either alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, between 2008 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate factors predictive of patients requiring extended AVP support were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) (48% vs 18%, P = .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (30% vs 12%, P = .024), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (AKI) (83% vs 49%, P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients requiring extended AVP support more frequently experienced a new intensive care unit (ICU) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, typically <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (39% vs 7%, P &lt; .001), and had higher 28-day mortality (74% vs 20%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the strongest independent predictors of prolonged AVP dependence were new ICU <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-17.8), PVD (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.4-13.1), and AKI (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.1-14.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preexisting PVD and AKI and those experiencing a new ICU <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> on AVP may be more likely to remain on AVP for 7 or more days </plain></SENT>
