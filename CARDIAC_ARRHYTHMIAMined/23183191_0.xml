<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation at the tragus, the anterior protuberance of the outer ear, for inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a noninvasive transcutaneous approach to deliver low-level vagal nerve stimulation to the tragus in order to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 16 pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, multielectrode catheters were attached to pulmonary veins and atria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three <z:chebi fb="66" ids="27998">tungsten</z:chebi>-coated microelectrodes were inserted into the anterior right ganglionated plexi to record neural activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tragus stimulation (20 Hz) in the right ear was accomplished by attaching 2 alligator clips onto the tragus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The voltage slowing the sinus rate or atrioventricular conduction was used as the threshold for setting the low-level tragus stimulation (LL-TS) at 80% below the threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At baseline, programmed stimulation determined the effective refractory period (ERP) and the window of vulnerability (WOV), a measure of AF inducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For hours 1-3, rapid atrial pacing (RAP) was applied alone, followed by concomitant RAP+LL-TS for hours 4-6 (N = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same parameters were measured during sinus rhythm when RAP stopped after each hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 4 other animals, bivagal transection was performed before LL-TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During hours 1-3 of RAP, there was a progressive and significant decrease in ERP, increase in WOV, and increase in neural activity vs baseline (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With RAP+LL-TS during hours 4-6, there was a linear return of ERP, WOV, and neural activity toward baseline levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05, compared to the third-hour values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 4 dogs, bivagal transection prevented the reversal of ERP and WOV despite 3 hours of RAP+LL-TS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LL-TS can reverse RAP-induced atrial remodeling and inhibit AF inducibility, suggesting a potential noninvasive treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
