<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The genetic background of catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) has been extensively investigated for the last decade in Western countries, but it remains unstudied in the Asian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: In 50 Japanese probands from unrelated families who satisfied clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>, genetic testing was conducted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> exons on 3 CPVT-related genes: cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 2 (RYR2), calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) and inward rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel 2 (KCNJ2), and the clinical features between RYR2-genotyped and -non-genotyped patient groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic and clinical evaluation was also done in 46 family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the genetic screening, 28 (18 novel) RYR2 (56.0%), 1 compound heterozygous CASQ2 (2.0%) and 1 KCNJ2 (2.0%) mutation carriers were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the RYR2 mutation-positive group, the frequency of bidirectional <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and the use of β-blockers were significantly higher than in the mutation-negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With regard to disease penetrance, the number of family members of RYR2-genotyped probands with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Thirty gene mutation carriers were found for 3 genes in 50 probands clinically diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The penetrance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> phenotype was significantly higher in RYR2 mutation carriers, thus RYR2 gene screening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patients would be indispensable to prevent unexpected cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> of young family members </plain></SENT>
