<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Understanding the regulation of cardiac ion channels is critical for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> caused by abnormal excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ion channels can be regulated by a change in function (qualitative) and a change in number (quantitative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional changes have been extensively investigated for many ion channels including cardiac voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the regulation of ion channel numbers has not been widely examined, particularly with respect to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> modulation of ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article briefly summarizes stimulus-induced endocytic regulation of major voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stimuli known to cause their endocytosis include receptor activation, drugs, and low extracellular [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>], following which the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels undergo either clathrin-mediated or caveolin-mediated endocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receptor-mediated endocytic regulation has been demonstrated for Kv1.2, Kv1.5, KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), and Kv4.3, while drug-induced endocytosis has been demonstrated for Kv1.5 and hERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o)-induced endocytosis might be unique for hERG channels, whose electrophysiological characteristics are known to be under strong influence of [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanisms have not been elucidated, it is obvious that major cardiac voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels are modulated by endocytosis, which leads to changes in cardiac excitability </plain></SENT>
