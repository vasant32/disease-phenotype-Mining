<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the interactions of pacemakers with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to identify device characteristics that could predict adverse interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The safety of MRI in patients with indwelling pacemaker systems remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated safety in most patients, but unpredictable, potentially concerning changes in pacemaker behavior have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with pacemaker devices in situ who were not pacemaker dependent and in whom MRI was essential for adequate diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored by electrocardiography and pulse oximetry during scanning; devices were interrogated and cardiac enzymes were measured before and after scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 32 patients studied (46 MRI examinations), 28 patients had a dual-chamber system and one had a biventricular device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regions scanned were the head and spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Devices were reprogrammed to asynchronous pacing or sense-only mode in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except six patients before MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During six scanning episodes (five patients), "power-on" resetting of the device was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Magnet-mode pacing was noted during four episodes (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> were noted in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in battery voltage, sensed P wave and R wave, pacing thresholds, lead impedance, or cardiac enzymes were noted immediately after MRI or at 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no significant changes were seen in pacemaker device function, and no adverse clinical events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A minority of patients with older devices had unpredictable changes in device behavior, which stresses the need for close monitoring during and careful device interrogation after scanning </plain></SENT>
