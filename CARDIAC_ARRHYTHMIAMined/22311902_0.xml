<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF), cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (SNA; CSNA) is increased, which has detrimental effects on the heart and promotes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the central renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in stimulating renal SNA in HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because SNA to individual organs is differentially controlled, we have investigated whether central angiotensin receptor blockade decreases CSNA in HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We simultaneously recorded CSNA and renal SNA in conscious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sheep and in sheep with HF induced by rapid ventricular pacing (ejection fraction: &lt;40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of blockade of central angiotensin type 1 receptors by intracerebroventricular infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> (1 mg/h for 5 hours) on resting levels and baroreflex control of CSNA and renal SNA were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the levels of angiotensin receptors in central autonomic nuclei were determined using autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sheep in HF had a large increase in CSNA (43±2 to 88±3 bursts per 100 heart beats; P&lt;0.05) and heart rate, with no effect on renal SNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In HF, central infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> for 5 hours significantly reduced the baseline levels of CSNA (to 69±5 bursts per 100 heart beats) and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">Losartan</z:chebi> had no effect in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In HF, angiotensin receptor levels were increased in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus but reduced in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> reduced the elevated levels of CNSA in an ovine model of HF, indicating that central angiotensin receptors play a critical role in stimulating the increased sympathetic activity to the heart </plain></SENT>
