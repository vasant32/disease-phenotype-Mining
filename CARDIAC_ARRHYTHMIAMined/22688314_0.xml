<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the pacing threshold in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase between retractable and Sweet-Tip active-fixation leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 132 patients who were implanted with active-fixation leads for new pacemaker implantation or additional leads required due to disconnected/leaking leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pacing threshold was measured at 4 time points: before screw-in, immediately, and 5 and 10 minutes after screw-in </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the pacing threshold was &gt; 1.5 volts (V) at 5 minutes, we changed the pacing site so that it became ≤ 1.5 V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 169 retractable leads (Medtronic: 107 leads, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical: 62 leads) and 33 Sweet-Tip leads (Boston: 33 leads) were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine leads were implanted in the atrium and 113 leads in the ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were implanted with both atrial and ventricular leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pacing threshold of Sweet-Tip leads increased immediately after screw-in, while that of retractable leads decreased (Sweet-Tip: 0.20 ± 0.57 V, Retractable: -0.15 ± 0.53 V, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pacing threshold of both types of leads decreased similarly from immediately to 5 minutes after screw-in (Sweet Tip: -0.29 ± 0.43 V, Retractable: -0.25 ± 0.36 V, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Few changes in the threshold were detected between 5 and 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because the pacing threshold of Sweet-Tip active-fixation leads increased immediately after screw-in and that of both type leads decreased from immediately to 5 minutes, we should measure the pacing threshold from 5 minutes after screw-in </plain></SENT>
