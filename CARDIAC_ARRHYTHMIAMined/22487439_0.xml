<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Various types of surgical and interventional procedures have been reported to cause cardiac sympathetic denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed at evaluating the effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in cardiac sympathetic innervation through meta-iodobenzyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42820">guanidine</z:chebi> (MIBG) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MIBG imaging was performed in 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) 1 day before and 1 week and 6 months after CABG with concomitant measurements of corrected QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each study we evaluated MIBG defect score in a 16-segment left ventricular model, MIBG-defect size (percent) from generated polar maps, and heart/mediastinum ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean MIBG defect score and size were increased (32 ± 9.5 vs 24 ± 5, P &lt; .0001, and 49.5% ± 20.4% vs 37% ± 8.7%, P = .004, respectively) and mean heart/mediastinum ratio was reduced (1.5 ± 0.4 vs 1.9 ± 0.3, P &lt; .0001) at 1 week after CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6 months these indices had no significant differences compared with their pre-CABG values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean corrected QT interval demonstrated no significant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increase in MIBG score in the second imaging was associated with adverse events related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and myocardial dysfunction during the 6-month follow-up period in a binary logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CABG is associated with clinically important but reversible reduction in cardiac sympathetic nerve function, with periprocedural effects (cardioplegia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, direct nerve injury) being possible mechanisms for this finding </plain></SENT>
