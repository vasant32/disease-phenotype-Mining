<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25354">mineralocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> have been demonstrated to be beneficial on the cardiac function, much attention has been given to the action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> on the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we have previously shown that both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> in vitro induce a marked acceleration of the spontaneous contractions, as well as a significant cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in isolated neonate rat ventricular cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a beneficial role of the steroid hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been also proposed, but the mechanism of its putative cardioprotective function is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that DHEA reduces both the chronotropic and the hypertrophic responses of cardiomyocytes upon stimulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (GR) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHEA inhibitory effects were accompanied by a decrease of T-type calcium channel expression and activity, as assessed by quantitative PCR and the patch-clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevention of cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> by DHEA was also revealed by measuring the expression of A-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of the negative chronotropic effect of DHEA, and its sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, pointed out the presence of both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the genomic action of DHEA was effective mostly upon <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> activation, its rapid, nongenomic response appeared related to DHEA <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the whole, these results suggest new mechanisms for a putative cardioprotective role of DHEA in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
