<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation of additional sites has been used to increase the efficacy of ablation procedures in restoring and maintaining <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to compare the effectiveness of PVI versus PVI plus adjuvant atrial ablations (PVI+) in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search using bibliographic databases and gray literature was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials evaluating clinical efficacy, effectiveness, or safety of ablation procedures in adults with AF were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 3,204 potential citations identified by the original search, 21 randomized controlled trials and three non-randomized trials were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis results reveal that in the first year after ablation, AF patients who underwent PVI+ strategies had a significantly higher rate of maintaining sinus rhythm than those who underwent PVI alone (RR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.02, 1.17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a subgroup meta-analysis was statistically significant for only PVI+ left atrial (LA) linear ablations (RR 1.16, 95 % CI 1.04, 1.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pooled success rates were higher in PVI+ group for both paroxysmal (RR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.06, 1.24) and non-paroxysmal AF (RR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.10, 2.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PVI+ strategies, particularly PVI+ LA ablations, appear to result in higher success rates than PVI alone in the first year after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Studies of longer duration are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and safety of different adjunctive ablation approaches for rhythm control in AF patients </plain></SENT>
