<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These agents are not fully selective and also activate β(1)-AR, but the involvement of β(1)-AR and β(2)-AR in the observed pro-arrhythmic effect has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of β(1)-AR and β(2)-AR activation on ventricular automaticity and the role of phosphodiesterases (PDE) in regulating this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Experiments were performed in the spontaneously beating isolated right ventricle of the rat heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also measured cAMP production in this tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The β(2)-AR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> (1-100 μM) produced a concentration-dependent increase in ventricular automaticity that was not affected by 50nM of the β(2)-AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> ICI 118551 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was enhanced by the non-selective PDE inhibitor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> (100 ��M) and by the selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram (1 μM) and Ro 201724 (2 μM), but not modified by the selective PDE3 inhibitors cilostamide (0.3 μM) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50693">milrinone</z:chebi> (0.2 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> alone and in the presence of either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> or rolipram were virtually abolished by 0.1 μM β(1)-AR <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CGP 20712A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">Salbutamol</z:chebi> (10 μM) increased the cAMP concentration, and this effect was abolished by CGP 20712A (0.1 μM) but enhanced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> (100 μM) or rolipram (1 μM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cilostamide (0.3 μM) failed to modify the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> on cAMP concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the increase of ventricular automaticity elicited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> was exclusively mediated through β(1)-AR and enhanced by non-selective PDE inhibition with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi> or selective PDE4 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, PDE3 did not appear to regulate this effect </plain></SENT>
