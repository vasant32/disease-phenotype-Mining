<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This international multicenter retrospective study including 152 patients (age 10.0 Â± 5.1 years, 62% male), divided into those with fascicular VT (85%, 129/152) and nonfascicular LV VT (15%, 23/152) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart structure or only a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> was largely ineffective in both groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> termination in 4/74 of fascicular VT and 0/5 of nonfascicular LV VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fascicular VT, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> were effective in 80% (74/92); however, when administered orally, there was a 21% (13/62) recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nonfascicular LV VT, a variety of antiarrhythmic therapies were used with no one predominating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ablation procedures were successful in 71% (72/102) of fascicular VT and 67% (12/18) of nonfascicular LV VT on an intention to treat analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 5 patients with fascicular VT and 1 patient with nonfascicular LV VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up period of 2 years (1 day to 15 years), 72% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with fascicular VT were off medications with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of noncardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In nonfascicular LV VT, follow-up was 3.5 years (0.5-15 years), P = 0.38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 65% of these patients were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients died suddenly (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical course and outcomes of pediatric patients with fascicular VT and nonfascicular LV VT are varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation procedures can be curative </plain></SENT>
