<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) during the first 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation reduces the incidence of clinically significant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and need for cardioversion or hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether early rhythm suppression decreases longer-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report the 6-month follow-up data from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Antiarrhythmics After Ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> study prospectively randomized patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing ablation to either receive (AAD group) or not receive (no-AAD group) AAD treatment for the first 6 weeks after ablation; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received atrioventricular nodal blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physicians were encouraged to stop the AADs after the 6-week treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 4 weeks of transtelephonic monitoring to document asymptomatic AF and an evaluation at 6 weeks and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 110 patients (71% men) aged 55Â±9 years were randomized, with 53 to AAD and 57 to no AAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, there was no difference in freedom from AF between the early AAD and no-AAD groups (38/53 [72%] versus 39/57 [68%]; P=0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lack of early AF recurrence during the initial 6-week period was the only independent predictor of 6-month freedom from AF (64/76 [84%] without early recurrence versus 13/34 [38%] with early recurrence; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although short-term use of AADs after AF ablation decreases early recurrence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, early use of AADs does not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early AF recurrence on or off AADs during the initial 6-week blanking period is a strong independent predictor of long-term AF recurrence </plain></SENT>
