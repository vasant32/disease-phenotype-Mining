<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Purpose: It is to examine clinical manifestations, early biochemical indicators, and risk factors for non-oliguric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> (NOHK) in extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> infants (ELBWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and biochemical data from 75 ELBWI admitted to Ajou University Hospital between Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2008 and Jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2011 by reviewing medical records retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NOHK was defined as serum <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ≥7 mmol/L during the first 72 hours of life with urine output ≥1 mL/kg/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: NOHK developed in 26.7% (20/75) of ELBWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among NOHK developed in ELBWI, 85% (17/20) developed within postnatal (PN) 48 hours, 5% (1/20) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and 20% (4/20) of NOHK infants expired within PN 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant differences in gestational age, use of antenatal steroid, and serum phosphorous level at PN 24 hours, and serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, calcium, and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> levels at PN 72 hours between NOHK and non-NOHK groups (p-value &lt;0.050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were no statistical differences in the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, mortality occurred, methods of fluid therapy, supplementation of amino acid and calcium, frequencies of umbilical artery catheterization and urine output between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: NOHK is not a rare complication in ELBWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It occurs more frequently in ELBWI with younger gestational age and who didn't use antenatal steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003228'>hypernatremia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002905'>hyperphosphatemia</z:hpo> occurred more often in NOHK group within PN 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, more use of antenatal steroid and careful control by monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> should be considered in order to prevent NOHK in ELBWI </plain></SENT>
