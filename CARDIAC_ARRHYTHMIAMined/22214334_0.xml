<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> can lead to significant hemodynamic alterations favoring the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) as well as its progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-containing antiarhythmic drug frequently used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients, is often the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000832'>primary hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To define the prevalence and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> outpatients in stable clinical conditions, with particular reference to the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 422 enrolled patients (326 males, aged 65±12 years), 51 (12%) had a previous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> while 21 (5%) were newly diagnosed at the enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, the overall prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> at the first evaluation was 17%and, as expected, it was significantly higher in females than males (33% vs 13%; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median 28 months) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> occurred in further 19 patients (incidence rate: 26/1000/year) and it was mainly attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> together the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypothyroid</z:e> patients, either those affected by thyroid failure at the enrolment than those developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> during the follow-up, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> therapy was continued or started in 69% of them; however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum TSH values were obtained only in 76% of treated cases (mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> dose: 69±44 mcg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In any case, in the group of patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> a significantly greater occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> progression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, especially the subclinical form, frequently occurs in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the unfavorable impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> on the progression and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, and the opportunity to adequately manage thyroid failure by means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> replacement therapy without the need to withdraw <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, we recommend regular testing of thyroid function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients, in particular in those submitted to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> therapy, in order to early diagnose a condition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> and titrate substitutive treatment </plain></SENT>
