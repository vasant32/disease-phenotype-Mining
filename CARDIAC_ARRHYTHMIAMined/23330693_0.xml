<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It describes the practical and clinical uses of resetting and entrainment, including the results of a variety of studies for these purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the amount of information generated, it is out of the scope of this review to comment in detail about each of the published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We rather present the basis for each described clinical use and for each type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in which these phenomena have been used with illustrative examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review covers: resetting response patterns; resetting/entrainment and termination; resetting/entrainment, fusion, and reentry; analysis of the postpacing interval; concealed entrainment; resetting/entrainment as an aid in the differential diagnosis among different arrhythmic mechanisms; usefulness of these phenomena in arrhythmic mechanisms other than macrorreentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we make some comments about the recent use of these phenomena and propose two new criteria for entrainment recognition </plain></SENT>
