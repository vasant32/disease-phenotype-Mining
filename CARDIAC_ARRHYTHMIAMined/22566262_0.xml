<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has not been reported in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to evaluate the effects of pulmonary valve replacement in repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients underwent pulmonary valve replacement after repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo>, excluding Rastelli type operation, between August 1981 and August 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of the pulmonary valve replacement were assessed by analyzing preoperative and postoperative cardiothoracic ratio, cardiac function, functional status, QRS duration and durability of the prosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were neither operative nor late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Cardiothoracic ratio significantly improved from 61.0 ± 5.2 % preoperatively to 56.2 ± 4.8 % postoperatively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The New York Heart association functional class significantly improved from 2.4 ± 0.8 preoperatively to 1.2 ± 0.4 postoperatively as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction showed significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>QRS duration showed significant reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The freedom redo pulmonary valve replacement at 20 years was 100 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulmonary valve replacement long after repair of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> had clinical benefits with low mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We recommend bioprosthesis for pulmonary valve replacement when adult-sized valve can be accommodated </plain></SENT>
