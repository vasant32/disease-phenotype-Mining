<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To enable the prevention of AA or its complications, timely identification of adult patients with CHD at risk of AA is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long total atrial activation times have been related to AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue Doppler imaging (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) permits noninvasive evaluation of the total atrial conduction time (PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the association between the PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration and the development of AA in adult patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 223 adult patients with CHD were followed up for the occurrence of AA after PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration was defined as the interval from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the P wave on the electrocardiogram to the peak of the A' wave at the lateral atrial wall on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the various clinical and echocardiographic parameters, the association between the PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration and AA occurrence was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 39 months (interquartile range 21 to 57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration of â‰¥126 ms was associated with AA during follow-up (log-rank, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, a PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration &gt;126 ms (hazard ratio 2.25, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 4.19) and history of AA (hazard ratio 4.89, 95% confidence interval 2.75 to 8.71) were independently associated with the occurrence of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration and a history of AA were independently associated with the occurrence of AA in adult patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PA-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> duration is a useful tool to identify patients with CHD at risk of AA during follow-up </plain></SENT>
