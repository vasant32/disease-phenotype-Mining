<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate differences in outcome between patients treated with successful strict, failed strict, and lenient rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The RACE II (Rate Control Efficacy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>Permanent Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo>) study showed no difference in outcome between lenient and strict rate control in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004754'>permanent atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in the strict group not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved the pre-defined heart rate target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The primary outcome was a composite of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the current analysis outcome events were analyzed from end of the dose-adjustment phase until end of follow-up (median 2.9 years [interquartile range: 2.4 to 3.0 years]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 614 patients, 608 completed the dose-adjustment phase-301 in the strict (resting heart rate &lt;80 beats/min, and during moderate exercise &lt;110 beats/min) and 307 in the lenient group (resting heart rate &lt;110 beats/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the strict group, 203 of 301 patients achieved the rate control target, and 98 failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Heart rate was different after the dose-adjustment phase between the successful strict (72 ± 7 beats/min), failed strict (86 ± 14 beats/min), and lenient (93 ± 8 beats/min) group (p &lt; 0.001) and remained significantly different during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was reached in 27 of 203 (14.2% KM estimate) in the successful strict versus 14 of 98 (15%) in the failed strict versus 35 of 307 (12.1%) in the lenient group (p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The components of the primary outcome and quality of life were similar in the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with permanent AF, successful strict rate control does not improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lenient rate control might be frontline therapy </plain></SENT>
