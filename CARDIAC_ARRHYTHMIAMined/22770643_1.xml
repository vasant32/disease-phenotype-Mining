<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> is a therapy for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to results in the ATHENA trial, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> on top of standard of care (SOC) decreases the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by 24% compared with SOC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A patient-level health economic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> on top of SOC versus SOC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The risk of experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes, treatment discontinuation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was modeled by separate health states, whereas adverse events were included as 1-time cost and utility decrements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>State transition probabilities were primarily deduced from the patient-level data from ATHENA using survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four sets of analyses were performed to reflect costs and treatment effects in Canada, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted in a newly defined patient population identified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to avoid the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> in permanent AF patients resembling those in the PALLAS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predicted survival time was, for the Canadian cohort, extended from 10.11 to 10.24 years when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> was added to SOC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were found for the other countries, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of €5828, €5873, €14,970, and €8554 per QALYs for Canada, Italy, Sweden, and, Switzerland, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> well below current established cost-effectiveness thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the EMA-restricted population, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were predicted to live longer, and the ICER increased but remained within established thresholds, with an average cost per QALY gained of €15,900 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> on top of SOC appears to be a cost-effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared with SOC alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the differences in the local settings considered, the results were consistent among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the countries included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00174785 </plain></SENT>
