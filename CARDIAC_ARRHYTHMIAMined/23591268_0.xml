<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The formidable task for the prescriber is to synthesize information about <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> therapeutic options and match the best treatment with the characteristics of the individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized decision support systems have been developed with the goal of integrating such information and presenting the acceptable therapeutic options on the basis of their effectiveness, often with limited consideration of their safety for a specific patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessing the safety of therapies relative to each patient is difficult, and sometimes impossible, because the evidence required to make such an assessment is either imperfect or does not exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, many of the alerts sent to prescribers by decision-support systems are not perceived as credible, and 'alert <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>' causes warnings to be ignored putting patients at risk of harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CredibleMeds.org and BrugadaDrugs.org websites are prototypes for evidence-based sources of safety information that rank drugs for their risk of a specific form of drug toxicity-in these cases, drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Broad incorporation of this type of information in electronic prescribing algorithms and clinical decision support could speed the evolution of safe personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
