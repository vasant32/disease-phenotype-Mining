<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The use of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> as an <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> is on the increase, but it is widely recognized that the goal of predictable and reproducible dosing is confounded by considerable variability in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics, and unpredictable side effects that include sedation, respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying these unpredictable effects are frequently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, to the best of our knowledge we present the first report of an association between accidental <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> overexposure and increased plasma protein binding, a new potential mechanism for drug interactions with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We describe here the cases of two patients who experienced markedly different responses to the same dose of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> during co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients were post-menopausal Caucasian women who were among healthy volunteers participating in a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under the trial protocol both patients received 6 mg of intravenous <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> before and then after taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One woman (aged 59) experienced symptoms consistent with opiate overexposure after the second dose of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> that were reversed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi>, while the other (aged 49) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To understand the etiology of this event, we measured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our affected patient only, a fourfold to eightfold increase in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> plasma concentrations after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> treatment was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detailed pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no change in metabolism or renal elimination in our patient, but the percentage of unbound <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> in the plasma decreased 3.7-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, the volume of distribution of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> decreased approximately fourfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increased plasma binding in our affected patient was consistent with observed increases in plasma protein concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The marked increase in the total plasma <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> concentration observed in our patient, and the enhanced pharmacodynamic effect, appear primarily due to a reduced volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The extent of plasma <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> binding may help to explain the unpredictability of its pharmacokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Changes in volume of distribution due to plasma binding may represent important causes of clinically meaningful drug interactions </plain></SENT>
