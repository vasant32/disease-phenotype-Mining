<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Sleep deprivation, which is a strong stressor, can greatly affect the cardiovascular system of rescue workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the effect of 24-h sleep deprivation on heart rate variability (HRV) in young healthy people and the protective effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty young, healthy subjects (6 women and 54 men), aged 25 ± 4.5 years, were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received 24-h continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, time, and frequency domain parameters were analyzed in subjects at the following three stages: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sleep stage, sleep deprivation stage, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment before sleep deprivation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 24-h sleep deprivation, the high frequency (HF) of HRV was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05), low frequency (LF) was remarkably increased (p &lt; 0.05), and LF/HF was significantly increased compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sleep (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some subjects presented with mild palpitation due to premature atrial complexes and premature ventricular complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> treatment stage, compared with the sleep deprivation stage, LF and LF/HF were significantly reduced, HF of HRV was elevated (p &lt; 0.05), and the total amount of premature atrial and ventricular complexes was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The underlying mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and HRV alteration after 24-h sleep deprivation could be attributable to lower vagal activity and elevated sympathetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> improves the change in autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity after 24-h sleep deprivation, which may be responsible for its protective role on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in healthy subjects undergoing sleep deprivation </plain></SENT>
