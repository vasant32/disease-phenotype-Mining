<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to establish a patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) model of catecholaminergic polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> patient due to the M4109R heterozygous point RYR2 mutation and reprogrammed to generate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-hiPSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient-specific hiPSCs were coaxed to differentiate into the cardiac lineage and compared with healthy control hiPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSCs-CMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracellular electrophysiological recordings demonstrated the development of delayed afterdepolarizations in 69% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-hiPSCs-CMs compared with 11% in healthy control cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adrenergic stimulation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (1 μM) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (5 μM) increased the frequency and magnitude of afterdepolarizations and also led to development of triggered activity in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e>-hiPSCs-CMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, flecainide (10 μM) and thapsigargin (10 μM) eliminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> afterdepolarizations in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter finding suggests an important role for internal Ca(2+) stores in the pathogenesis of delayed afterdepolarizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laser-confocal Ca(2+) imaging revealed significant whole-cell [Ca(2+)] transient irregularities (frequent local and large-storage Ca(2+)-release events, broad and double-humped transients, and triggered activity) in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> cardiomyocytes that worsened with adrenergic stimulation and Ca(2+) overload and improved with beta-blockers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release was also identified in the hiPSCs-CMs and the threshold for such events was significantly reduced in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of hiPSCs for studying inherited arrhythmogenic syndromes, in general, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CPVT</z:e> specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such, it represents a promising paradigm to study disease mechanisms, optimize patient care, and aid in the development of new therapies </plain></SENT>
