<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop a quantitative event-free prediction model of late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> is driven by risk factors that determine the occurrence of late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> type secundum patients, included in the Belgian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital Heart Disease</z:hpo> Registry, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on review of the literature, age at repair, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> before and within one month after repair were included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Cox-regression analysis, a weighted risk score was derived, which was validated using the Brier score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 155 patients (117 women; median age at follow-up 53.9years, range 18.0-78.8) having 349 follow-up years was included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (25.2%) presented with late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that a mPAP≥25mmHg (HR 4.39; 95%CI 2.17-9.09; P&lt;0.0001), the presence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> before (HR 3.52; 95%CI 1.75-7.14; P=0.002) and≤1month after repair (HR 6.62; 95%CI 2.38-20.00; P&lt;0.0001) and gender (HR 2.18 95%CI 1.11-4.35) were associated with late atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A risk score (0 to 28 points) to predict atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> free survival was derived for follow-up times ranging from one to 5years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean Brier score for the model was 0.10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We formulated a well validated risk model to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed whether this model can be used for individual clinical risk stratification and whether the model can be adapted for application in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
