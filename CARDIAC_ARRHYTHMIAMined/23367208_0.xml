<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a QRS detection algorithm for wearable ECG applications using a proportional-derivative (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ECG data of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> have irregular intervals and magnitudes of QRS waves that impede correct QRS detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To resolve the problem, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> control is applied to avoid missing a small QRS wave followed from a large QRS wave and to avoid falsely detecting noise as QRS waves when an interval between two adjacent QRS waves is large (e.g. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, pause, and arioventricular block) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG data was obtained from 78 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> and tested for the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity and positive predictive value were 99.28% and 99.26%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed algorithm has low computational complexity, so that it can be suitable to apply mobile ECG monitoring system in real time </plain></SENT>
