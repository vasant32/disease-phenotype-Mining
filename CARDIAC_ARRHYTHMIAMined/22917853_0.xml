<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MAP0004 is an orally inhaled investigational drug containing dihydroergotamine (DHE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although DHE has been used for 60 years with no reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, a thorough QT study had not previously been performed with DHE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of MAP0004 on the QT interval as required for regulatory approval of a new product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover study enrolled healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were assigned to receive, in randomized sequence, MAP0004 at a supratherapeutic dose (3-fold the clinically effective dose) (3.0 mg), moxifloxacin 400 mg, or inactive vehicle, each administered with 1 placebo capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Triplicate ECGs were performed continuously at baseline (day 0), before dosing, and over 24 hours after dosing in each treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect on the QT interval was assessed using the Fridericia (QTcF) and individualized (QTcI) correction formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-four healthy adults (20 men, 34 women; mean age, 28 years) completed the trial and had measurable plasma levels of DHE after MAP0004 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The largest observed mean difference in QTcI between MAP0004 and placebo was 0.08 msec, and the largest 1-sided 95% upper confidence bound was 2.24 msec, both at 30 minutes after dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, moxifloxacin increased the mean QTcI between 9.57 and 11.28 msec relative to placebo, with a 1-sided lower 95% CL between 7.23 and 8.96 msec, confirming that the assay sensitivity was sufficient to detect MAP0004-related effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>Nausea</z:hpo> (27.8%) was common following MAP0004 administration but apparently did not influence the QTc interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A supratherapeutic dose of MAP0004 was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc intervals</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the proposed clinical dose (1.0 mg), MAP0004 is unlikely to affect the QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MAP0004 and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35220">primary metabolite</z:chebi> showed no evidence for prolongation of the QTc interval in healthy subjects according to the criteria required from regulatory agencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01191723 </plain></SENT>
