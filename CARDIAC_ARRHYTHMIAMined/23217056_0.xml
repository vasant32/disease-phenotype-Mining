<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined indices of children's parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system activity (PNS), including respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during baseline (RSAB) and RSA reactivity (RSAR), to a laboratory challenge, and importantly the interaction between RSAB and RSAR as predictors of multiple parameters of children's sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lower RSAR denotes increased vagal withdrawal (reductions in RSA between baseline and task) and higher RSAR represents decreased vagal withdrawal or augmentation (increases in RSA between baseline and task) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A community sample of school-attending children (121 boys and 103 girls) participated [mean age = 10.41 years; standard deviation (SD) = 0.67] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children's sleep parameters were examined through actigraphy for 7 consecutive nights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings demonstrate that RSAB and RSAR interact to predict multiple sleep quality parameters (activity, minutes awake after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and long wake episodes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall pattern of effects illustrates that children who exhibit more disrupted sleep (increased activity, more minutes awake after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and more frequent long wake episodes) are those with lower RSAB in conjunction with lower RSAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This combination of low RSAB and low RSAR probably reflects increased autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system arousal, which interferes with sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results illustrate the importance of individual differences in physiological regulation indexed by interactions between PNS baseline activity and PNS reactivity for a better understanding of children's sleep quality </plain></SENT>
