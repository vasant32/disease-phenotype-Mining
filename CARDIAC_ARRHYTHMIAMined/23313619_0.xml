<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the activities of HERG channel inhibition by these compounds have been found to have potential risks to induce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, although the mechanism of action is still elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of HERG channel inhibition by these compounds by using whole-cell patch clamp experiments in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cell line stably expressing HERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tetra-n-octylammonium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> and benzethonium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitions of HERG channel currents with IC(50) values of 4nM and 17nM, respectively, which were also voltage-dependent and use-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both compounds shifted the channel activation I-V curves in a hyperpolarized direction for 10-15mV and accelerated channel activation and inactivation processes by 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, tetra-n-octylammonium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> shifted the inactivation I-V curve in a hyperpolarized direction for 24.4mV and slowed the rate of channel deactivation by 2-fold, whereas benzethonium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that tetra-n-octylammonium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> and benzethonium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> are open-channel blockers that inhibit HERG channels in the voltage-dependent, use-dependent and state-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
