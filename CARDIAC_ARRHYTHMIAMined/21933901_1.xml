<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most outcome studies of patients presenting early to the emergency department with potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes have focused on either the index diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) or a composite end point at a later time frame (30 days or 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the performance of 9 biomarkers for an early serious outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=186) who presented to the emergency department within 6 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had their presentation serum sample measured for the following analytes: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase isoenzyme MB, enhanced AccuTnI troponin I (Beckman Coulter), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-modified albumin, interleukin-6, investigation use only hs-cTnI (Beckman Coulter), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, and cardiac troponin I (Abbott AxSym) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed patients until 72 h after presentation and determined whether they experienced the following serious cardiac outcomes: MI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, refractory ischemic cardiac pain, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROC curves were analyzed to determine the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and optimal cutoffs for the biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AUCs for the hs-cTnI assay (0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96), the AccuTnI assay (0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95), and the hs-cTnT assay (0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.94) assays were significantly higher than those for the other 6 assays (AUC values≤0.71 for the rest of the biomarkers, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROC curve-derived optimal cutoffs were ≥19 ng/L (diagnostic sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 88%), ≥0.018 μg/L (diagnostic sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 86%), and ≥32 ng/L (diagnostic sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 92%) for the hs-cTnI, AccuTnI, and hs-cTnT assays, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The optimal cutoffs for predicting serious cardiac outcomes in this low-risk population are different from the published 99th percentiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are required to verify these findings </plain></SENT>
