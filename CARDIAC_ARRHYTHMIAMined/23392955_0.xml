<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A precise knowledge of the coronary sinus (CS) <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and its potential anomalies seems essential to increase the rate of success in patients with a prior history of multiple ablation failures of the posteroseptal accessory pathway or in whom this procedure cannot be performed easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe the anatomic and electrocardiographic characteristics of the CS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> in association with the posteroseptal accessory pathway and subsequent catheter ablation results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 12 patients with posteroseptal accessory pathways associated with CS diverticula from patients referred to Tehran Heart Center for electrophysiological study and ablation between January 2004 and December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population consisted of eight males and four females at a mean age of 48.2 ± 17.5 years with posteroseptal accessory pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent initial presentation was orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success for radiofrequency ablation and the recurrence rate were 75 and 16.6 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Larger diverticula tended to have more failure and recurrence rate, albeit not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patient's characteristics could significantly predict the success of the ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our total initial failure rate and subsequent recurrence was around 41 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Better results might have been achieved had we applied irrigated tip catheters or NavX(TM)-guided cryoablation or subxiphoid epicardial mapping and ablation </plain></SENT>
