<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were asked to talk about their most distressing traumatizing experience while continuous measures of heart rate, pre-ejection period, and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, high dissociators had significantly larger increases in heart rate and larger decreases in pre-ejection period and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during trauma recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In opposition to our hypothesis, these results suggest that female trauma victims reporting high levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> during a prior trauma may be more reactive to traumatic reminders than victims who report lower levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
