<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meditation practices are associated with a reduction in adrenergic activity that may benefit patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the design and methods of a pilot study testing the feasibility of a phone-delivered mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design and Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consecutive, clinically stable outpatients (n = 52) will be screened for study eligibility within a month of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related procedure or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock and will be randomly assigned to MBI or to usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MBI patients will receive eight weekly individual phone sessions based on two mindfulness practices (awareness of breath and body scan) plus home practice with a CD for 20 minutes daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients assigned to usual care will be offered the standard care planned by the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assessments will occur at baseline and at the completion of the intervention (between 9 and 12 weeks after randomization) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary study outcome is feasibility; secondary outcomes include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, mindfulness, and number of administered shocks during the intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If proven feasible and effective, phone-delivered mindfulness-based interventions could improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> outpatients with serious cardiovascular conditions </plain></SENT>
