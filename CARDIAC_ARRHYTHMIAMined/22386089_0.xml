<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We developed a novel technique for tracheobronchial reconstruction after resection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the right upper lung involving the right main bronchus and lower trachea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of the technique are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between December 2007 and October 2011, 9 patients underwent treatment with our new technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right upper lobe was resected together with the involved right main bronchus and right lateral wall of the lower trachea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Closure of the trachea was started at the level of the carina and continued upward, leaving an oval opening at the upper end of the tracheal defect, to which the bronchus intermedius was reimplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sutured lower trachea became the extension of the left main bronchus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure was completed successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent partial carinal resection, 2 underwent replacement of the superior vena cava by interposition graft, 2 underwent partial resection of the superior vena cava, and 1 underwent partial resection of the esophageal wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No major complications, including dehiscence, stenosis, and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurred in 2 patients, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001604'>vocal cord paresis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died 31 months after operation, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up 28 months after operation, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other 7 are alive to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite this being a small series and short follow-up, this tracheobronchial reconstruction shows encouraging preliminary results with low mortality and morbidity, and could be an alternative to other methods for the treatment of carefully selected patients with advanced <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the right upper lobe </plain></SENT>
