<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the general population, rates of 1-2% are reported but in older patients, the rates increase to over 10% (in those aged 85years or older) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many older patients present to the emergency department (ED) with complaints that could be caused or associated with AF including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (urinary or chest) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most devastating complication of AF is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and early detection of AF and initiation of treatment (specifically the use of anti-coagulant medication) can significantly reduce the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AF is associated with high healthcare costs and has significant impacts on disability and quality of life especially if a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review aims to describe the aetiology and treatment options for patients with newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed AF with an emphasis on how ED staff can manage older patients with AF and ensure optimal care is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment of AF has three main considerations (i) appropriateness for thromboembolic prophylaxis, (ii) rate control (including anti-arrhythmics, cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi>, B blockers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi>) and (iii) rhythm control with traditional cardioversion (either electrically or pharmacologically) or utilising interventional means to maintain sinus rhythm with cardiac surgery and more recently radio-frequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As anti-coagulation is widely implemented, the risks and benefits associated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and the newer agents will be described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that more than half of those with AF are over 75years and 30% of AF is diagnosed incidentally, there is an imperative for prompt diagnosis to reduce the risk of debilitating complications especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AF should not be viewed as yet another concomitant "benign" condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Emergency staff are well placed to detect AF and ensure appropriate treatment is commenced to reduce the adverse events associated with it </plain></SENT>
