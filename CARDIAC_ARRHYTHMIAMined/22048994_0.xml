<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics and effectiveness of catheter ablation for SMVTs in DHCM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Five patients with DHCM (mean age; 67.0 years old, five males) who underwent catheter ablation for drug-refractory SMVTs were included the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of five patients suffered from electrical storm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the endocardial ablation failed, epicardial and/or intracoronary <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> ablation, or surgical cryoablation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ablation procedures and electrocardiogram (ECG) of targeted SMVTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 SMVTs were targeted for ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> (VTs) was diagnosed as reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endocardial ablation successfully eliminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> VTs in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients needed epicardial ablation, intracoronary <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> ablation, and surgical cryoablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one VT arose from the basal septum, basal anterior to anterolateral left ventricle (LV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the ECGs demonstrated similar features of idiopathic outflow or mitral annulus VTs reflecting the origins, there were characteristic multiple QRS deflections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Following the ablation, four (80%) of the five patients are free from VT recurrence during 18 months of the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In DHCM patients, VT circuits predominantly distributed in the basal septum and the basal anterior to anterolateral LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition to the endocardial ablation, alternative approaches were required in some patients </plain></SENT>
