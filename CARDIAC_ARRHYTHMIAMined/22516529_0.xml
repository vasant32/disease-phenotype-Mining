<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether the severity of OSA influences the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with OSA and AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the impact of OSA severity on the treatment of patients with symptomatic AF using AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients (mean age 62 ± 15 years, 21 women) treated with AADs for symptomatic AF who underwent overnight polysomnography were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rhythm control was prospectively defined as successful if a patient remained on the same AAD therapy for ≥6 months with ≥75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (40%) had severe OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (49%) were rhythm controlled with AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonresponders to AADs were more likely to have severe OSA than milder disease (52% vs 23%, p &lt;0.05); those with severe OSA were less likely to respond to AADs than participants with nonsevere OSA (39% vs 70%, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonresponders had higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> indexes than responders (34 ± 25 vs 22 ± 18 events/hour, p = 0.05), but there were no differences between these groups in minimum oxygen saturation or percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with severe OSA are less likely to respond to AAD therapy for AF than those with milder forms of OSA </plain></SENT>
