<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> are difficult to recognize, but repolarization disturbances have been shown to be the cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) was related to the risk of occurrence of corrected QTc-interval prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> recorded on electrocardiography (ECG) Holter monitoring in kidney transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The 75 adult first kidney transplant patients included 43 men with an overall mean age of 45Â±12 years (range, 20-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional patient monitoring during the procedure and in the postoperative period consisted of a continuous ECG tracing recording and investigation of the rs10918594 NOS1AP polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed Transient QTc-interval prolongation during the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NOS1AP genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For further statistical analysis, we combined GG homozygotes and CG heterozygotes because of the small numbers available; therefore, only a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no gender differences in QTc-interval patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed no interaction between NOS1AP and QTc-interval values taken at various times among the kidney recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The transplantation procedure may lead to dynamic repolarization disturbances, which may produce an increased risk of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> despite optimization of patient status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The NOS1AP rs203462 polymorphisms did not correlate with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation among kidney recipients </plain></SENT>
