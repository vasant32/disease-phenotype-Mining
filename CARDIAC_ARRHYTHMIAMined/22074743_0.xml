<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients were monitored after an AF ablation procedure using the hand-held monitor for 2 months immediately after and then for 1 month approximately 6 months postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 12-lead 24-hour Holter monitoring at 1, 2, and 6 months postablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During months 1-2, 425 of 2942 hand-held monitor transmissions from 21 of 25 patients showed AF/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (Afl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> decreased by month 6 to 85/1128 (P &lt; .01) in 15 of 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring diagnosed AF/Afl in 8 of 25 and 7 of 23 patients at months 1-2 and month 6, respectively (P &lt; .01 compared with wireless hand-held monitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Af/Afl diagnosis by wireless monitoring preceded Holter detection by an average of 24 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Wireless monitoring with 12-lead electrocardiogram reconstruction demonstrated reliable AF/Afl detection that was more sensitive than serial 12-lead 24-hour Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
