<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Nowadays, radiofrequency ablation (RF) is recommended treatment method of atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> associated with accessory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure is characterised by high early and late efficacy and low risk of complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate early effectiveness and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences subjectively experienced by the patient after RF ablation of accessory pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome</z:e>, depending on it's localization and the electrical parameters of ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy two patient in age 13-79 (35 +/- 15,3) who had RF ablation of accessory pathway preformed were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Localization of the pathway, electrical parameters of ablation and early effectiveness of the procedure was assessed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group of patients who had successful ablation (n = 57) were asked about recurrence of heart palpitation after minimum 6 months from the procedure and further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, information about comorbidities and medication used by patients was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Septal localization of accessory pathway was most frequent (59,7%) in study group (n = 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early effectiveness was achieved in 80% of patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrical ablation parameters were similar in a group with successful (n = 57) and unsuccessful procedure (n = 15) with exception of numbers of RF application (14 vs 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a late observation, 59,09% of the patients did not experienced recurrence of heart palpitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In accessory pathway with difficult <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> access, increased number of RF application do not increase procedure effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjective late effect of the ablation reported by the patient is lower than after electrophysiological study verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lack of correlation between pathway localization and early effectiveness of the ablation or late recurrence of heart palpitation reported by the patient </plain></SENT>
