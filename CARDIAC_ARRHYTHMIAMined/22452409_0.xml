<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is routinely recommended that patients with pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>), and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-D) avoid bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)--a commonly used method to estimate body composition--because of the concern for the potential for BIA interference with pacemaker or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of such interference is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Assess for incidence of interference between BIA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> or CRT-D devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and cardiac implanted electronic devices (50% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>, 50% CRT-D) underwent BIA during real-time device interrogation to detect interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study patients were 90% male, with mean age 54 ± 14 years, and mean LVEF 23 ± 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Devices from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four leading cardiac device manufacturers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Device therapies were temporarily disabled to prevent inappropriate shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During body composition testing using BIA, no evidence of interference with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> function was seen in any patient, including no telemetry disruption, no oversensing on any lead, and no patient symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the manufacturers' recommendation to avoid BIA in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, this study showed no evidence of any interference in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bioimpedance analysis might be safe in such patients, but further confirmatory studies are required </plain></SENT>
