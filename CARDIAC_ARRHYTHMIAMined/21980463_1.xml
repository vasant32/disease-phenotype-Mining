<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is wide-spread human exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33216">bisphenol A</z:chebi> (BPA), a ubiquitous estrogenic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disruptor that has been implicated as having potentially harmful effects on human heart health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Higher urine BPA concentrations have been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, neither the nature nor the mechanism(s) of BPA action on the heart are understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The rapid (&lt;7 min) effects of BPA and 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) in the heart and ventricular myocytes from rodents were investigated in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In isolated ventricular myocytes from young adult females, but not males, physiological concentrations of BPA or E2 (10⁻⁹ M) rapidly induced arrhythmogenic triggered activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects of BPA were particularly pronounced when combined with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under conditions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> stimulation, E2 and BPA promoted <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in female, but not male, hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cellular mechanism of the female-specific pro-arrhythmic effects of BPA and E2 were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure to E2 and/or BPA rapidly altered myocyte Ca²⁺ handling; in particular, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> markedly increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, and increased SR Ca²⁺ load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">Ryanodine</z:chebi> (10⁻⁷ M) inhibition of SR Ca²⁺ leak suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-induced triggered activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rapid response of female myocytes to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> was abolished in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER) β knockout mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Physiologically-relevant concentrations of BPA and E2 promote <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in a female-specific manner in rat hearts; the pro-arrhythmic actions of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> are mediated by ERβ-signaling through alterations of myocyte Ca²⁺ handling, particularly increases in SR Ca²⁺ leak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study provides the first experimental evidence suggesting that exposure to estrogenic <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> disrupting chemicals and the unique sensitivity of female hearts to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> may play a role in arrhythmogenesis in the female heart </plain></SENT>
