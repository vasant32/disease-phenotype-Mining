<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this study we report the first experiences with the GORE® Septal Occluder in transcatheter treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010405'>secundum ASD</z:mp> were selected for GORE® Septal Occluder device closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 25.8±4.6 years (range 4-60), ten were children below the age of 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Closure was guided by transeosophageal or intracardiac echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography was used at follow-up (median time 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> defects were balloon sized and device size was chosen according to an occluder/defect size ratio ≥2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> size was 11.4±0.5mm (range 6-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> GORE® Septal Occluder sizes (15, 20, 25 and 30 mm) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had additional defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The aortic rim was deficient in twelve patients and four patients had a septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were seen in 17 patients and 19 had <z:mp ids='MP_0002754'>dilated right ventricles</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implantation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Delivery was easy and intuitive by the new delivery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had residual shunts at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean procedure time was 38±5minutes (range 20-120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had resolution or improvement in symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or AV valve regurgitation and right ventricular dimensions were normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The GORE® Septal Occluder is an efficient device for closing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e> up to 15mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is feasible for defects with different <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> including a deficient aortic rim, septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and multiple fenestrations and due to its compliance and conformability it has a presumed low risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
