<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Terfenadine has been reported to cause cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, we investigated its pro-arrhythmic potential in various in vitro models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Pro-arrhythmic effects of terfenadine were investigated in rabbit isolated hearts and left ventricular wedge preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we examined its effect on the human <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) current in HEK293 cells transfected with hERG and on the I(Na) current in rabbit ventricular cells and human atrial myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Terfenadine concentration- and use-dependently inhibited I(Na) in rabbit myocytes and in human atrial myocytes and also inhibited the hERG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the rabbit left ventricular wedge and heart preparations, terfenadine at 1 µM only slightly prolonged the QT- and JT-intervals but at 10 µM, it caused a marked widening of the QRS complex, cardiac wavelength shortening, incidences of in-excitability and non-TdP-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0006109'>fibrillation</z:mp> (VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) without prolongation of the QT/JT-interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 10 µM terfenadine elicited a lower incidence of early afterdepolarizations versus non- <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> (TdP)-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> (100% incidence), and did not induce TdPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the concentration of terfenadine in the tissue-bath was low, it accumulated within the heart tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest that: (i) the induction of non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, which is caused by slowing of conduction via blockade of I(Na) (like Class Ic flecainide), may constitute a more important risk for terfenadine-induced cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; (ii) although terfenadine is a potent hERG blocker, the risk for non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> exceeds the risk for TdPs; and (iii) cardiac wavelength (λ) could serve as a biomarker to predict terfenadine-induced VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
