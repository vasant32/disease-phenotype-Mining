<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Considering that prolongation of the QTc is a reliable marker of a menacing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> called <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) - that can progress to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, application of Bazett, or Rautaharhu formulas can lead to a proper predictive valuation of a "torsadogenic risk." Case-analysis raises up the proposal that QTc or QTp will allow to identify high risk groups; performs a close pharmaco-vigilance and legally register ECG follow-up, avoiding unnecessary withdrawal of useful drugs from market </plain></SENT>
