<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess the impact of respiratory gating (RG) on electroanatomical mapping of CTI and to assess the efficiency of CTI ablation guided by the Carto3® system equipped with the new respiration gating software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients (mean age, 60 ± 13 years; 25 male) undergoing cavotricuspid ablation for symptomatic common AFL were randomly assigned to CARTO™ mapping with or without enabling RG module (Group A, RG OFF, Group B, RG ON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant reduction in mean RA volume, CTI central length and CS ostium maximum diameter has been observed in the RG maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean total procedural, fluoroscopy and radiofrequency (RF) time were 102.9 ± 35.3, 10.6 ± 3.3, 22.9 ± 14.2 min in group A and 75.3 ± 21.7, 3.6 ± 4.5, 10.4 ± 5.7 min in group B, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electroanatomical mapping systems' accuracy may be strongly influenced by respiration movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current study showed that automatic respiratory gated acquisition resulted in a better visualization of CTI, and this determines a relevant reduction in fluoroscopy and RF times </plain></SENT>
