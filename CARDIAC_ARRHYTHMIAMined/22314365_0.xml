<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients were investigated; the mean age was 16.3 years, and the mean duration of implantation was 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological problems</z:e>, three domains of the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were administered to the 25 patients[13 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DRQoL was assessed with a disease-specific pediatric questionnaire, the short-form 11-item Worries About (WA)<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients C13 years old scored significantly higher than the reference group on the domains of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and sleeping problems of the SCL-90-R (T = 7.5, p\0.001; T = 5.4, p\0.001; and T = 7.8, p\0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had received an (in)appropriate shock reported more depressive symptoms (T = 2.1, p\0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with [2 years implant duration (N = 19) or who had received an (in)appropriate shock (N = 13) showed lower DRQoL scores on the modified WAICD (T = 2.1, p\0.04; T = 2.1, p\0.5, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age at implantation or underlying disease did not influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological problems</z:e> or DRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients showed more <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and sleeping disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Worries were increased among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks and in those who had their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implanted for[2 years </plain></SENT>
