<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An earlier study found that adult patients of Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> had an abnormally longer QT dispersion and corrected QT dispersion, markers for ventricular arrhythmogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QT dispersion is a simple non-invasive arrhythmogenic marker that can be used to assess homogeneity of cardiac repolarisation; however, it has not been studied in children with Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess QT dispersion and corrected QT dispersion, and their relationship with systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in a group of children with Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed electrocardiography and Doppler echocardiography on patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum QT, minimum QT, QT dispersion, corrected QT, maximum corrected QT, minimum corrected QT, and corrected QT dispersion intervals were measured from standard 12-lead electrocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in QT dispersion, corrected QT dispersion, and systolic-diastolic function of the left ventricle parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the 12 months of follow-up, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were documented in either group </plain></SENT>
