<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the connection between intracellular MMPs activation and arrhythmogenesis is not well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we determined localization of MMP in the mitochondria using confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that electrical pacing induces the activation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> MMP (mtMMP) and is associated with myocyte mechanical dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myocytes were isolated and field stimulated at 1 and 4 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myocyte mechanics and calcium transient was studied using Ion-Optix system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> MMP-9 activation was evaluated using zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a 25% increase in 1 Hz and 40% increase in 4 Hz stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed an increase in mtMMP activation with increase in electrical pacing compared to 0 Hz with a significant increase (p&lt;0.05, n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Field stimulation at 4 Hz decreased cell re-lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of calcium transient were reduced with increase in contraction frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that electrical stimulation activates mtMMP-9 that is associated with myocyte mechanical dysfunction </plain></SENT>
