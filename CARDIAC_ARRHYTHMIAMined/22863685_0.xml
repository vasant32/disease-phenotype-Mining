<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The risk of cerebrovascular embolic events with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is potentially linked to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, epidemiologic studies exploring the association between AF and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> have reported conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of observational studies specifically designed to evaluate the prospective relationship between AF and incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, BioMedCentral, Embase, Cardiosource, clinicaltrials.gov, and ISI Web of Science (January 1980 to May 2012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No language restriction was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts to identify population-based studies that prospectively evaluated the association between AF and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in patients not suffering an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function at baseline, providing the hazard ratio (HR) obtained in multiple Cox regression analyses, and adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Collaboration, and extracted patient and study characteristics and the adjusted HR of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> with its 95% confidence interval (CI) of patients with AF vs those without AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight studies with 77,668 patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies had a prospective observational design and included elderly patients (mean age range 61-84 years) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive function at baseline, of whom 11,700 (15%) had AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 7.7 Â± 9.1 years (range 1.8-30 years), 4773 of 73,321 (6.5%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two studies did not report the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> at follow-up but reported the adjusted HR and were included in the pooled analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At pooled analysis adjusted for baseline confounders and covariates, AF was independently associated with increased risk of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (HR = 1.42 [95% CI 1.17-1.72], P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AF is independently associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with AF should be periodically screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, which should be included among the outcomes assessed in AF treatment trials </plain></SENT>
