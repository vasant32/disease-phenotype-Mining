<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using minimal invasive perventricular device closure in managing this type of <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: During Dec 2008 and Aug 2010, 34 Pediatric patients with doubly committed subarterial <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> who met the inclusion criteria for device closure were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Perventricular closure was attempted using a unique design eccentric device under the guidance of real-time transesophageal echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications such as residual shunt, valve regurgitation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded in postoperative period and during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Result: Perventricular device closure was successfully done in 28 patients (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>6 patients converted to open surgical repair due to residual shunt &gt;3mm (1 patient), more than mild degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (3 patients) and device mal-position (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete closure rate was achieved in 93% at discharge and 100% during 20 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No severe complications such as device embolism, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and noticeable valve regurgitation were noted during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedure induced trivial grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic valve regurgitation</z:hpo> was noted in five (18%) patients after procedure while only one (4%) persisted during midterm follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Perventricular closure of doubly committed subarterial <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSDs</z:mp> appears to be a safe and effective minimally invasive technique with good mid-term outcomes. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
