<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficits in the function of the central circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29425">(SCN)</z:chebi> have been implicated, but the responsible mechanisms have not been clearly delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we characterize the progression of rhythm deterioration in mice to 900 d of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal behavioral and sleep-wake recordings in up to 30-month-old mice showed strong fragmentation of rhythms, starting at the age of 700 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp recordings in this age group revealed deficits in membrane properties and GABAergic postsynaptic current amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A selective loss of circadian modulation of fast delayed-rectifier and A-type K+ currents was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the tissue level, phase synchrony of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> neurons was grossly disturbed, with some subpopulations peaking in anti-phase and a reduction in amplitude of the overall multiunit activity rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that aberrant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> rhythmicity in old animals--with electrophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at the single-cell level and phase desynchronization at the network level--can account for defective circadian function with aging </plain></SENT>
