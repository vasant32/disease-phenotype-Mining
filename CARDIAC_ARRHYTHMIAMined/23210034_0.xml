<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many previous studies have shown that electrocardiographic (ECG) changes occur patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to identify the frequency, influencing factors, and outcome of clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 122 patients including ECG finding, age, sex, the Hunt-Hess grade, the Fisher's grade, the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, peak blood pressure and heart rate, location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score, the days of admission to the intensive care unit, the presence of symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 122 SAH patients, 50% (n = 61) had a verified clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant independent factors associated with clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although adjustments for the effects of age, Hunt-Hess grade, and the presence of symptomatic vasospasm on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were made, clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were still independently predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, 11.5% versus 27.9%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.524, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.229-10.100, p = 0.019) and poor outcome (GOS â‰¤ 2, 13.1% versus 29.5%, adjusted OR 3.202, 95% CI 1.174-8.732, p= 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after SAH are associated with a high mortality rate, and serious cardiac and neurological comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> on admission should undergo close cardiac monitoring, and the presence of rhythm disturbances should prompt aggressive measures to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), maintain a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac rhythm, and minimize the presence of autonomic stress </plain></SENT>
