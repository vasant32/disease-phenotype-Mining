<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optimal use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>) requires information regarding the drug's pharmacokinetics and the influence of various factors on the drug's disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to establish the role of patient characteristic in estimating doses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> using nonlinear mixed effects modeling in Japanese patients treated with oral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum concentrations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 151 serum trough concentrations from 23 patients receiving repetitive oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the pharmacokinetics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was accomplished using a 1-compartment open pharmacokinetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of a variety of developmental and demographic factors on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> disposition was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Estimates generated by nonlinear mixed effects modeling indicated that the clearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> was influenced by the demographic variables: total body weight (TBW), daily dosage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> (DD), body mass index (BMI), gender (GEN), duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e> dosing (DUR), and patient clearance factor (Conc(θ); Conc = serum trough concentration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final pharmacokinetic parameters were CL/F (L/h) = 0.072·TBW·Conc(-1.01)·1.95(DD≥200)·0.931(BMI≥25)·1.37(GEN)·DUR(-0.016), and Vd/F (L) = 78.4·TBW, where CL is total body clearance and Vd is volume of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses were given orally, it was impossible to assess the bioavailability (F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DD ≧200 is an indicator variable that has a value of 1 if the patient is receiving more than 200 mg daily dosage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>, and 0 otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMI ≧25 is an indicator variable that has a value of 1 if the BMI is 25 kg/m² and over, and 0 otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GEN is an indicator variable that has a value of 1 if the patient is woman, and 0 otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors developed new population pharmacokinetic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical application of the findings in the present study to patient care may permit selection of an appropriate initial maintenance dose, thus enabling the clinician to achieve a desired therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
