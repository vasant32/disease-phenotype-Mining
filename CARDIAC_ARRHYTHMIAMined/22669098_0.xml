<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of grafts, mechanical stress and pharmacological agents have substantial influence on the short and long term graft patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi> is among the most frequently used antiarrhythmic agents perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> on internal mammarian artery (IMA), radial artery (RA) and saphenous vein (SV) grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using standard tissue bath techniques, responses to increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50512">lidocaine hydrochloride</z:chebi> were obtained, in segments of IMA, RA and SV grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were enrolled in the study with a total number of 48 grafts (16 for IMA, RA and SV grafts each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> concentrations between 10(-9)M and 10(-3.5)M were studied to represent therapeutic plasma concentration of 1.5-5 mcg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In IMA and RA grafts, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50512">lidocaine hydrochloride</z:chebi> caused vasodilatation (40.5±1.9% and 39.1±2.6 % respectively) at concentrations between 10(-9) to 10(-7.5) M while causing a dose dependent vasoconstriction response at concentrations above 10(-7.5) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SV graft samples, lidocain <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> caused vasodilatation (24.4±1.9 %) at concentrations between 10(-9) to 10(-7) M while causing dose dependent vasoconstriction at concentrations above 10(-7) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For vasoconstriction effect, mean±SD values for E(max) were calculated as: 120.1±6.6% in IMA, 83.35±5.06% in RA, and 154.0±13.8% in SV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstriction in the SV samples was higher than in the RA and IMA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean ±SD LogEC(50) values were -5.15±0.27, -5.76±0.11 and -5.56±0.19 for SV, IMA and RA grafts respectively.) There was a statiscally significant differences in the Log EC(50) values between SV, IMA and RA (P&lt;0.005) CONCLUSION: Based on the results of our study, we conclude that, increasing doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in the perioperative period may cause vasospasm in IMA, RA and SV grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, avoiding high doses may have a role in improving perioperative and long term mortality </plain></SENT>
