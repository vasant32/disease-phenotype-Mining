<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a consecutive group of 93 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> referred for ablation, the site of origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> was assessed by activation mapping and pace-mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 93 patients (8%), an intramural focus in the interventricular septum was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> arising intramurally had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle-branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with inferior axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intramural focus was effectively ablated from both sides of the septum in 4 patients and from within the septum in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ablation procedure of an intramural focus near the His bundle failed in 2 of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECG and mapping characteristics of the patients with intramural septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> differentiated intramural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> from other sites of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> can originate from intramural foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation mapping from within a perforator branch within the interventricular septum is helpful in identifying the site of origin of intramural septal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation within the septum or from both sites of the septum may be required to eliminate the targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
