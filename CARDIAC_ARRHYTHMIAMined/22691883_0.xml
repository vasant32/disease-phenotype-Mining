<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>ABSTRACT:: Many studies indicate that increase in late <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L) of cardiomyocytes causes intracellular Na overload, and subsequently raises the reverse Na/Ca exchanger current(INCX), ultimately resulting in intracellular Ca overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, using drugs to inhibit the increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L under various pathological conditions can lower intracellular Ca overload.This study was intended to explore the effect of sophocarpine on the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L, INCX, calcium transient and contraction in rabbit ventricular myocytes induced by Anemonia sulcata toxin II (ATX II), an opener of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, with the application of whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, the video based motion edge detection system and the intracellular calcium concentration determination system.The results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> (4μM) obviously decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L and INCX enlarged by ATX II ( 30 nM ), and sophocarpine ( 20 μM, 40 μM and 80 μM) also inhibited both of the parameters concentration-dependently in rabbit ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, transient <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current remained unaffected by the above-mentioned concentrations of ATX II, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> and sophocarpine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, sophocarpine also reversed diastolic calcium concentration, calcium transient amplitude and ventricular muscle contractility augmented by ATX II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its effects were similar to those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi>, a specific inhibitor of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel.In conclusion, sophocarpine inhibits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L, INCX, diastolic Ca concentration and contractility in rabbit ventricular myocytes, which suggests that relief of intracellular Ca overload through inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>.L is likely to become a new therapeutic mechanism of sophocarpine against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and myocyte damage associated with intracellular Ca overload </plain></SENT>
