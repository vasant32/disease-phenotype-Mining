<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electrode placement has been shown to affect defibrillation efficacy and required energy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest investigating the relationship between esophageal electric fields (EEFs) and atrial defibrillation thresholds to determine the feasibility of creating patient-specific electrode placements using EEFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study presents the design and implementation of an esophageal probe (EP) that accurately measures three-dimensional electric fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The root-mean-square error of the EP was 1.69% as determined by measurements performed in an electrolytic tank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EP also performed well during in vivo testing in a pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a strong positive relationship between EEF(2)s and applied energy during defibrillation strength shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEF measurements were also repeatable, with less than 4.24% difference between repeated shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of a probe designed specifically for measuring electric fields in the esophagus </plain></SENT>
