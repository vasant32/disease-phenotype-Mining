<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated this relation using suprachiasmatic nuclei lesion (SCNX) and pharmacological autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system block (ANSB) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant 24-h variations were observed in the expression of clock genes Per2, Bmal1, and Dbp and ion channel genes KCNA5, KCND2, KCHIP2, and KCNK3 in the control mice hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SCNX mice, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genes examined lost circadian rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the ANSB mice, the expressions of the three clock genes were dampened significantly but still had circadian rhythm, whereas the four ion channel gene expressions lost rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate also lost circadian rhythm in both the SCNX and ANSB mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some ion channel gene expressions might be regulated by the central clock in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi> through the ANS but not the peripheral clock in the heart </plain></SENT>
