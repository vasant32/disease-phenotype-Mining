<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>Long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) is characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization and variable clinical course with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the nonpore region of the LQTS-associated KCNH2 gene (also known as hERG) are mostly associated with coassembly or trafficking abnormalities, resulting in haplotype insufficiency and milder clinical phenotypes compared with mutations in the pore domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a nonpore mutation on the channel current, which was identified from an LQTS family with severe clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two members of a Japanese family with LQTS were searched for mutations in KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNJ2 genes by using automated DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We characterized the electrophysiological properties and glycosylation pattern of the mutant channels by using patch clamp recording and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the LQTS patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> and cardiopulmonary arrest, we identified the novel T473P mutation in the transmembrane nonpore region of KCNH2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband's father carried the same mutation and showed prolonged corrected QT interval and frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> following the administration of garenoxacin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patch clamp analysis in heterologous cells showed that hERG T473P channels generated no current and exhibited a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only incompletely glycosylated hERG T473P channels were observed by using Western blot analysis, suggesting impaired trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that a trafficking-deficient mutation in the transmembrane nonpore region of KCNH2 causes a dominant negative effect and a severe clinical course in affected patients </plain></SENT>
