<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate specific changes in the plasma proteome of BS patients and family members sharing the same gene mutation (SCN5AQ1118X), with the aim to identify novel disease biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that the levels of several proteins were significantly altered in BS patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E, prothrombin, vitronectin, complement-factor H, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin-D</z:chebi>-binding protein, voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi>-selective channel protein 3 and clusterin were considerably increased in plasma sample of BS patients, whereas alpha-1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen and angiotensinogen were considerably decreased; moreover, post-translational modifications of antithrombin-III were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the light of these results, we hypothesize that these proteins might be considered as potential markers for the identification of disease status in BS </plain></SENT>
