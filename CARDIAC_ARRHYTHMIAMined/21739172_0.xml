<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a few case reports, but the characteristics and etiology of chordae tendineae rupture have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the clinical characteristics of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>mitral regurgitation</z:hpo> due to chordal rupture in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was performed on ten consecutive patients, with a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of 4.6 ± 1.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite nonspecific initial symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> and four required resuscitation within a few days (mean, 1.8 ± 1.8 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chest radiographs showed <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>pulmonary congestion</z:mp> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mildly increased cardiothoracic ratio in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data and electrocardiograms showed nonspecific findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography revealed ruptured chordae in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; locations were anterior (50%), posterior (20%), and both (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was performed within 24 h of admission in eight patients (mean, 3.6 ± 5.1 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings included inflammatory cells in six specimens and myxomatous degeneration in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No bacteria were isolated from preoperative blood cultures, pathological tissues, or excised tissue cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody levels were insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three preoperatively resuscitated patients developed neurological sequelae and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in four after mitral valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute onset</z:hpo> and rapid deterioration in patients with ruptured chordae tendineae necessitates early surgical intervention to improve outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Though the etiology remains unknown, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is in infants approximately 4 months of age, suggesting a definite disease entity </plain></SENT>
