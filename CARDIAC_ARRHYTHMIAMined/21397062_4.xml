<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our knowledge of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of Mg(2+) (re)absorption, particularly the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> uptake of Mg(2+) along the nephron, has benefitted from positional cloning approaches in families with Mg(2+) reabsorption disorders; however, basolateral Mg(2+) transport and its regulation are still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, by using a candidate screening approach, we identified CNNM2 as a gene involved in renal Mg(2+) handling in patients of two unrelated families with unexplained dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002917'>hypomagnesemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the kidney, CNNM2 was predominantly found along the basolateral membrane of distal tubular segments involved in Mg(2+) reabsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basolateral localization of endogenous and recombinant CNNM2 was confirmed in epithelial kidney cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological analysis showed that CNNM2 mediated Mg(2+)-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents that were significantly diminished in mutant protein and were blocked by increased extracellular Mg(2+) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data support the findings of a recent genome-wide association study showing the CNNM2 locus to be associated with serum Mg(2+) concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutations found in CNNM2, its observed sensitivity to extracellular Mg(2+), and its basolateral localization signify a critical role for CNNM2 in epithelial Mg(2+) transport </plain></SENT>
