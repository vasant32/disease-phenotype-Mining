<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a thorough evaluation of residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (rRLS) after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to analyze the characteristics related to <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> diagnosis and closure, focusing on rRLS and clinical recurrences until 24-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were extrapolated from the 12-month Italian <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1035 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> diagnosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS) were assessed by contrast-enhanced transesophageal and/or transthoracic echocardiography and/or transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> diagnosis with RLS data were available in 894 of 1035 (86.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rRLS was investigated in 49.6% (6 months), 27.1% (12 months), and 3.5% (24 months), and observed in 19.5% (6 months) and 18.2% (12 months) of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large permanent rRLS was observed in less than 3% of RLS-positive patients after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 14 and 3 of 14 neurological recurrences were observed in 10 of 444 (2.25%) and 2 of 243 (0.8%) patients within the 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among these, no large rRLS was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological events at 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty of 444 subjects had non-neurological complications, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> within the sixth month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure is a safe procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>rRLS is not uncommon but large rRLS is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinical complications, mostly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, are not unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the data of the whole survey is underway </plain></SENT>
