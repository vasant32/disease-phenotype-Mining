<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current reports on ablation in VA storm are in the form of small series and have relative small representation in a large observational series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to systematically synthesize the available literature to appreciate the efficacy and safety of ablation in the setting of VA storm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical electronic databases through 31 January 2012 were searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> storm was defined as recurrent (≥ 3 episodes or defibrillator therapies in 24 h) or incessant (continuous &gt;12 h) VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies reporting data on VA storm patients at the individual or study level were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 471 VA storm patients from 39 publications were collated for the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> VAs were successfully ablated in 72% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71-89%] and 9% (95% CI: 3-10%) had a failed procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related mortality occurred in three patients (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 6% patients had a recurrence of VA storm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of VA was significantly higher after ablation for arrhythmic storm of monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) relative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> or polymorphic VT with underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (odds ratio 3.76; 95% CI: 1.65-8.57; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
