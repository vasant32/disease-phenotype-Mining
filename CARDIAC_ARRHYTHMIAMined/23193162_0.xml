<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available on the best management of significant TR that develops after pacemaker or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and regarding any benefits of right ventricular (RV) lead extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the impact of RV lead removal on lead-induced TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2010 at the tertiary care hospital who had a preoperative indication of TR and underwent percutaneous extraction of an RV lead with the intent of trying to correct moderate or severe TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-procedure echoes and clinical data were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the four patients identified, the RV lead was removed and placed in the coronary sinus to try to improve moderate or severe TR due to lead impingement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant improvement in the degree of TR except one patient where TR improved slightly from moderate to mild-moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a dilated tricuspid valve annulus by the time of lead extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tricuspid annulus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> appeared to account for the persistent TR after RV lead removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A greater degree of tricuspid valve annulus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> may be a marker and mechanism for irreversible lead-induced TR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether surgical tricuspid valve repair or replacement combined with RV lead extraction would result in better outcomes than a percutaneous lead extraction approach </plain></SENT>
