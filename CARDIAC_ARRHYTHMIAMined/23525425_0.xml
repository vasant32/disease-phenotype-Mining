<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although there are multiple methods of risk stratification for ST-elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>), this study presents a prospectively validated method for reclassification of patients based on in-hospital events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dynamic risk score provides an initial risk stratification and reassessment at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The dynamic TIMI risk score for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> was derived in ExTRACT-TIMI 25 and validated in TRITON-TIMI 38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline variables were from the original TIMI risk score for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New variables were major clinical events occurring during the index hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each variable was tested individually in a univariate Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variables with P&lt;0.05 were incorporated into a full multivariable Cox model to assess the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each variable was assigned an integer value based on the odds ratio, and the final score was the sum of these values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dynamic score included the development of in-hospital MI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, major bleed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The C-statistic produced by the dynamic score in the derivation database was 0.76, with a net reclassification improvement (NRI) of 0.33 (P&lt;0.0001) from the inclusion of dynamic events to the original TIMI risk score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the validation database, the C-statistic was 0.81, with a NRI of 0.35 (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This score is a prospectively derived, validated means of estimating 1-year mortality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> at hospital discharge and can serve as a clinically useful tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By incorporating events during the index hospitalization, it can better define risk and help to guide treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
