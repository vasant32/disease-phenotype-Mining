<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activation of cell signaling pathways involving inhibitory heterotrimeric G proteins acts to slow the heart rate via modulation of ion channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large number of Regulators of G protein signalings (RGSs) can act as GTPase accelerating proteins to inhibitory G proteins and thus it is important to understand the network of RGS\G-protein interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We will review our recent findings on in vivo heart rate control in mice with global genetic deletion of various inhibitory G protein alpha subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We will discuss potential central and peripheral contributions to the phenotype and the controversies in the literature </plain></SENT>
