<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have provided evidence of an association between ambient air pollution and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac morbidity, little is known regarding susceptibility factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study in 9 Italian cities between 2001 and 2005 to estimate the short-term association between airborne particles with aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 μm (PM10) and cardiac hospital admissions, and to identify susceptible groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated associations between daily PM10 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorders</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> for 167,895 hospitalized subjects ≥ 65 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effect modification was assessed for age, sex, and a priori-defined hospital diagnoses (mainly cardiovascular and respiratory conditions) from the previous 2 years as susceptibility factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The increased risk of cardiac admissions was 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7% to 1.4%) per 10 μg/m PM10 at lag 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect was slightly higher for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (lag 0, 1.4% [0.7% to 2.0%]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (lag 0-1, 1.1% [0.4% to 1.9%]) than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (lag 0, 1.0% [0.2% to 1.8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women were at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (2.0% [1.2% to 2.8%]; test for interaction, P = 0.022), whereas men were at higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (1.9% [0.8% to 3.0%]; test for interaction, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects aged 75-84 years were at higher risk of admissions for coronary events (2.6% [1.5% to 3.8%]; test for interaction, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions was a clear marker of susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An important effect of PM10 on hospitalizations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> was found in Italian cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sex and older age were susceptibility factors </plain></SENT>
