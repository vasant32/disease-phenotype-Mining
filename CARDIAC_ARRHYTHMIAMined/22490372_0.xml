<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is designed to compare quick optimization between intracardiac electrogram (IEGM) with surface electrocardiogram (ECG)-guided VV delay optimization for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients (M/F = 34/17, age = 71 ± 10-year-old) scheduled for CRT implantation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After atrioventricular optimization, VV delay optimization was performed by either the IEGM or surface ECG method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aortic velocity time integral (AVTI) was used  as a reference in comparing these two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography was studied under three varying parameters-CRT switched off or CRT switched on, and VV delay optimized by IEGM guided or surface ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AVTI could be improved equally by either IEGM-guided or surface ECG-guided VV optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the other parameters [QRS width, systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV)] could be improved by either the IEGM or ECG method in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the immediate improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> LVEF was independently related to favourable outcomes (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03-1.47, P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The AVTI, QRS width, SDI, LVEF, LVEDV, and LVESV could be improved equally by either IEGM-guided or surface ECG-guided method after CRT </plain></SENT>
