<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to characterize myocardial scar using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to quantify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic response to single-site and multi-site LV stimulation and to relate this to the position of the LV leads in relation to myocardial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy had implantation of two LV leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One lead (LV1) was positioned in a postero-lateral vein, the second (LV2) in a separate coronary vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LV dP/dtmax was recorded using a pressure wire during stimulation at LV1, LV2, and both sites simultaneously (LV1 + 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were deemed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> responders if ΔLV dP/dtmax was ≥ 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess dyssynchrony as well as location and burden of scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Scar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was registered with fluoroscopy to assess LV lead position in relation to scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LV dP/dtmax increased from 726 ± 161 mmHg/s in intrinsic rhythm to 912 ± 234 mmHg/s with LV1, 837 ± 188 mmHg/s with LV2, and 932 ± 201 mmHg/s with LV1 and LV2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of 19 (47%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> responders with LV1 vs. 6/19 (32%) with LV2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 19 (63%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> responders with simultaneous LV1 + 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two of three patients benefitting with multi-site pacing had the LV1 lead positioned in postero-lateral scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multi-site LV pacing increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> response by 16% vs. single-site pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This was particularly beneficial in patients with postero-lateral scar identified on CMR </plain></SENT>
