<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current IKs is essential for cardiac repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gain-of-function mutations in KV7.1, the pore-forming Î±-subunit of the IKs channel, have been associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF is associated with mutations in the IKs channel regulatory subunit KCNE1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 209 unrelated early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> lone AF patients (&lt; 40 years) the entire coding sequence of KCNE1 was bidirectionally sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the identified KCNE1 mutants electrophysiologically in heterologous expression systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two non-synonymous mutations G25V and G60D were found in KCNE1 that were not present in the control group (n = 432 alleles) and that have not previously been reported in any publicly available databases or in the exom variant server holding exom data from more than 10.000 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proband 1 (female, age 45, G25V) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of paroxysmal AF at the age of 39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proband 2 (G60D) was diagnosed with lone AF at the age of 33 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient has inherited the mutation from his mother, who also has AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both probands had no mutations in genes previously associated with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In heterologous expression systems, both mutants showed significant gain-of-function for IKs both with respect to steady-state current levels, kinetic parameters, and heart rate-dependent modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in KV7.1 leading to gain-of-function of IKs current have previously been described in lone AF, yet this is the first time a mutation in the beta-subunit KCNE1 is associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding further supports the hypothesis that increased <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current enhances AF susceptibility </plain></SENT>
