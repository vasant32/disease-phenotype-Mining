<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stage-related proportion, associations, and clinical impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients with HLHS have not been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> subtypes have not been described in this patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at Duke University Medical Center who received one or more palliative stages for HLHS from September 2000 to October 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 49 (57%) of 86 patients had 63 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred between stage I and II, with 44 (51%) of 86 patients manifesting a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring in this interval tended to be associated with a higher mortality compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring after stage II (odds ratio = 3.2 [95% CI 0.84-12.0], P = .09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was similar in patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> (P = .99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>Supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (16/63; 25%), but persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardias</z:hpo> (sinus node dysfunction or high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo>) had the worst clinical outcome with 73% mortality (8/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005180'>tricuspid regurgitation</z:hpo>, left ventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndrome</z:e>, type of stage I operation, or need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients with HLHS experience serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> requiring therapy, especially between stage I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> following stage I is associated with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
