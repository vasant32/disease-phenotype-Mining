<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single study reported an increased QT variability index (QTVI), a marker for cardiac arrhythmogenicity, in AN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to further evaluate repolarization dynamics in a large cohort of patients with AN without electrolyte abnormalities and to evaluate previously unreported repolarization dynamics parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three AN patients and 45 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine AN patients were hospitalized for a mean time of 1.5Â±1.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rest were ambulatory AN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were conducted under strict standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QT variability index, normalized QT variability (QTVN) and power spectral analysis of QT dynamics were conducted with designated computer software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the patients had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although mean QT was higher in AN patients compared with controls, QTc results were similar following corrections for RR interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in QTVI, QTVN and power spectral analysis parameters among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of QTVI and QTVN were comparable to those previously published for healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During 3 years of follow-up, no patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or suddenly died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medically treated AN patients who gained weight and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum electrolytes appeared to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QTc and QT variability indexes, reflecting a nonincreased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We suggest that weight normalization, medical treatment and lack of electrolyte abnormalities are responsible in part for these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the prognostic significance of QTVI and QTVN in AN is warranted </plain></SENT>
