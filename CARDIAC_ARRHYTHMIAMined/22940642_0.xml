<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study tested whether individual differences in youths' tonic and stress-induced ANS functioning, assessed at age 14, and changes in ANS functioning from age 14 to 16 predicted corresponding changes in youths' behavioral warmth, as displayed during videotaped mother-child conflict interactions conducted at age 14 and 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased behavioral warmth was predicted by increased baseline respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), increased SCL stress reactivity, decreased RSA stress reactivity (i.e., greater vagal suppression), and decreased baseline SCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also an interaction between RSA stress reactivity at age 14 and changes in maternal warmth from age 14 to 16, such that increased maternal warmth was only associated with increased adolescent warmth for adolescents with lower RSA stress reactivity at age 14 </plain></SENT>
