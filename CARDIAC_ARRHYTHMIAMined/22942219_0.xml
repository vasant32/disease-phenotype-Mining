<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the available assessments of mitral isthmus block were thoroughly reviewed in 271 mitral isthmus ablation procedures undertaken among 236 patients from October 2008 to April 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional block was established in 186 of 271 (69%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Careful evaluation of electrograms recorded on the multipolar coronary sinus and ablation catheters was undertaken to identify and understand the characteristics of pitfall, if any </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pitfall was encountered in 55 of 271 (20%) procedures among 51 patients and categorized into 6 types (types 1, 3, 4, and 5 led to spurious diagnosis of block; types 2 and 6 led to erroneous diagnosis of absence of block) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 14, 10, 17, 2, 15, and 3 (total=61) cases of pitfall types 1 through 6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operator recognized 42 of 61 (69%) pitfalls intraprocedurally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition of types 1 and 5 was difficult because of indiscernible electrograms at usual amplifier settings or presence of slow conduction mimicking block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Every fifth assessment of bidirectional block across mitral isthmus linear lesion using differential coronary sinus and left atrial appendage pacing techniques encounters a pitfall, which can lead to erroneous clinical diagnosis of block or absence of block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recognition of pitfall during the procedure is feasible and necessitates careful distinction of far-field left atrium from the local coronary sinus electrograms besides appropriate adjustments in catheter position and pacing outputs </plain></SENT>
