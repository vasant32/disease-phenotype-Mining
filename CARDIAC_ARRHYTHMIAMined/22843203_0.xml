<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data exist on long-term outcomes for patients requiring placement of bilateral stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine the medium- to long-term outcomes after bilateral stenting of branch PAs in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedural and follow-up data on patients undergoing bilateral PA stenting during a single procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From October 2001 to May 2012, 26 patients underwent bilateral PA stenting (total of 62 stents) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these patients was 9.5 ± 12 years, and their mean weight was 27 ± 19 kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean procedural time was 191 ± 67 min, and the mean fluoroscopy time was 50 ± 29 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean gradient across the right pulmonary artery decreased from 35 ± 22 to 11 ± 12 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left pulmonary artery gradient decreased from 32 ± 17 to 10 ± 12 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001), and the right ventricle to descending aorta pressure ratio decreased from 71 ± 18 % to 46 ± 13 % (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraprocedural adverse events were encountered in four patients (1 small PA dissection, 2 intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and 1 first-degree burn on the thigh) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 41 ± 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further interventions were required for 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bilateral PA stenting is effective and safe, with an instantaneous significant decrease in pressure gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The need for reintervention is common, so continued follow-up assessment is warranted </plain></SENT>
