<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That means that the approach is not really patient specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A lot of implanted patients will not receive any shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The implantation of large categories of patients is interesting on a global therapeutical point of view but, when considering the economical aspects, it would be more useful to have better selection criteria in order to obtain a more patient-specific approach, avoiding implanting patients who will never receive shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parameters commonly used to select patients for implantations have a good negative predictive value but a low positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> the approach is quite different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic drug treatment has shown many limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic drugs are useful and safe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients only if the contra-indications are strictly respected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main difficulty concerns patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The story of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> development is illustrative of the necessity of a patient-specific approach in the treatment strategy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ATHENA trial made with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> showed a benefit in patients with underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> but no patient with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the PALLAS trial has clearly shown that the drug is contra-indicated in patients with any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, a patient-specific approach is mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This review illustrates the dichotomy of the two different approaches </plain></SENT>
