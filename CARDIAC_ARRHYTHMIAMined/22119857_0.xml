<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to quantitatively compare LAA <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in patients with paroxysmal and persistent patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF underwent pre-procedural multislice cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal LAA orifice dimensions and left atrial and LAA volumes were measured from three-dimensional segmented CT reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with paroxysmal and 23 with persistent AF were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean maximal LAA orifice dimension was larger in persistent (27.2 ± 4 mm) than paroxysmal AF (22.9 ± 3 mm, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation was found between both increasing LAA volume (r = 0.76), maximal LAA orifice dimension (r = 0.63) and left atrial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased LAA orifice dimension is associated with left atrial enlargement in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding may impact LAA occlusion device sizing </plain></SENT>
