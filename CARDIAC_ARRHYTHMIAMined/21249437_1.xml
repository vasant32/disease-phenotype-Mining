<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) became the therapy of choice in patients with drug-resistant AF with success rates between 30% and 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, CA remains a challenging intervention with major complications in about 5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, stratification into high and low success patient groups would be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) on the outcome of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal (PAF) and persistent (Pers-AF) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 73 patients (median age 53 years, 77% men) undergoing PVI for drug-refractory PAF (n = 45) or Pers-AF (n = 28), the serum BNP concentration was measured before and 3 months after the ablation procedure to assess any association of pre- and post-interventional BNP concentrations with therapeutic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients had suffered from AF for a median of 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient had structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> or an impaired left-ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 54 patients (74%) had stable sinus rhythm 3 months after PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median baseline BNP levels in both PAF and Pers-AF patients were significantly lower in patients with a 3-month successful PVI than those in which it was unsuccessful, 57.5 pg/ml (20.4-87.9) versus 159.0 pg/ml (124.1-177.5; p = 0.001) in PAF patients and 90.3 pg/ml (41.0-155.0) versus 176 pg/ml (89.6-297.4; p = 0.026) in patients with Pers-AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis identified pre-interventional BNP levels as the only independent predictor for 3-month PVI outcomes (p = 0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in this study, the predictive value of BNP for PVI outcomes was not high enough to permit individual outcome prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After successful PVI, BNP levels were significantly lower in patients with PAF and Pers-AF (median changes -16.9 and -23.8 pg/ml; p = 0.010 and p = 0.022, respectively), but not in patients with AF in follow-up (median change 9.0 pg/ml and -29.6 pg/ml; p = 1.000 and p���= 0.109, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pre-ablation BNP level seems to be an independent marker for successful PVI procedures in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF; however, the observed level of association is moderate </plain></SENT>
