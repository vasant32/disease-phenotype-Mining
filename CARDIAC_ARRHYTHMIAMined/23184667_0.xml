<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intravenous bisphosphonates are widely used for treatment of postmenopausal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are associated with transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms, predominantly after the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> (up to 32 %) or ibandronate (up to 5 %) administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experience in clinical practice suggests that the incidence of post-dose symptoms is higher than has been reported in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety of annual infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> and 3-monthly injections of ibandronate in women with postmenopausal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study we analysed safety data from 272 postmenopausal women treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> (n = 127; mean age 68.6 ± 9.4 years) or intravenous (IV) ibandronate (n = 145; mean age 69.1 ± 9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Safety data (including occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw) were gathered in phone call interviews by using a standardized questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of patients with adverse events was significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> as compared to ibandronate-treated patients, primarily because of a larger number of post-dose symptoms after bisphosphonate administrations (54.3 % vs. 33.1 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (more common after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> infusion), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>) appeared in a similar proportion of patients after IV treatment (within 24-36 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms lasted for &gt;3 days in approximately 50 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptoms decreased after subsequent infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms was more frequent after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46557">zoledronic acid</z:chebi> than after IV ibandronate in bisphosphonate-naïve patients but comparable in patients pretreated with oral bisphosphonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no spontaneous reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the jaw, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> or delayed fracture healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although IV bisphosphonates are generally safe, the occurrence of transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms after IV bisphosphonates seems to be more frequent in clinical practice than has been reported in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
