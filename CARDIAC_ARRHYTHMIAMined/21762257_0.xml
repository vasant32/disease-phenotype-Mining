<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ventricular repolarization (VR) is strongly influenced by heart rate (HR) and autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity, both of which also are important for arrhythmogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their relative influence on VR is difficult to separate, but might be crucial for understanding while some but not other individuals are at risk for life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at a certain HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was therefore designed to assess the "pure" effect of HR increase by atrial pacing on the ventricular gradient (VG) and other vectorcardiographically (VCG) derived VR parameters during an otherwise unchanged condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 19 patients with structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts, a protocol with stepwise increased atrial pacing was performed after successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conduction intervals were measured on averaged three-dimensional (3D) QRST complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, various VCG parameters were measured from the QRS and T vectors as well as from the T loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were performed after at least 3 minutes of rate adaptation of VR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VR changes at HR from 80 to 120 bpm were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The QRS and QT intervals, VG, QRSarea, Tarea, and Tamplitude were markedly rate dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Tp-e/QT ratio was rate independent as well as the T-loop <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> parameters Tavplan and Teigenvalue describing the bulginess and circularity of the loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In healthy individuals, the response to increased HR within the specified range suggests a decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of depolarization instants, action potential <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and consequently of the global VR </plain></SENT>
