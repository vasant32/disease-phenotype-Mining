<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in humans are atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms and high dominant frequency have been proposed as critical regions for maintaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>; however, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between the characteristics of electrograms and the propagation pattern underlying them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a realistic 3D computer model of the human atria has been developed to investigate this relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model includes a realistic geometry with fiber orientation, anisotropic conductivity and electrophysiological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We simulated different tachyarrhythmic episodes applying both transient and continuous ectopic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrograms and their dominant frequency and organization index values were calculated over the entire atrial surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our simulations show electrograms with simple potentials, with little or no cycle length variations, narrow frequency peaks and high organization index values during stable and regular activity as the observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (except in areas of conduction block) and in areas closer to ectopic activity during focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cycle length variations and polymorphic electrograms with single, double and fragmented potentials were observed in areas of irregular and unstable activity during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results also show: (1) electrograms with potentials without negative deflection related to spiral or curved wavefronts that pass over the recording point and move away, (2) potentials with a much greater proportion of positive deflection than negative in areas of wave collisions, (3) double potentials related with wave fragmentations or blocking lines and (4) fragmented electrograms associated with pivot points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our model is the first human atrial model with realistic fiber orientation used to investigate the relationship between different atrial arrhythmic propagation patterns and the electrograms observed at more than 43000 points on the atrial surface </plain></SENT>
