<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence and electrophysiologic characteristics of ART in children with WPW have not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with WPW undergoing electrophysiology (EP) study from 1990 to 2009 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with clinical or inducible ART were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,147 patients with WPW underwent EP study and 30 patients had ART (2.6%) and were the subject of this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 16±3 years, weight was 65±16 kg, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> cycle length was 305±55 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two patients (7%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (13%) had more than one accessory pathway (AP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location of the AP was left sided in 53% of patients and right sided in 47%, with septal location and left lateral pathways most commonly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AP conduction was found to be high risk in 17 patients (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ablation was not attempted in two patients (7%) due to proximity to the HIS and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>heart block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation was acutely successful in 93% of the patients in whom it was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ART is a rare finding in children undergoing EP study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over half of the patients with ART were found to be high risk and multiple AP were uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Unlike the adult population, ART occurred commonly with septal APs </plain></SENT>
