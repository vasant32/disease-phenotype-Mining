<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that dysregulation of the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) is associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> widespread pain (CWP), and that dysregulation of the ANS is associated with higher pain intensity in CWP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1,574 subjects (healthy controls as well as persons with depressive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorders) participating in The Netherlands Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Pain Grade was used to assess pain intensity and pain-related disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heart rate (HR), SD of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interval (SDNN), the preejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) were used to assess the ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses and linear regression analyses were conducted with adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No differences in HR, PEP, SDNN, or RSA values were found between CWP subjects and controls after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, lower SDNN and lower RSA were associated with higher pain intensity in subjects with CWP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower parasympathetic activity, as assessed with SDNN and RSA, is associated with higher pain intensity in subjects with CWP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This large and well-controlled study does not provide evidence for an association between dysregulation of the ANS and the presence of CWP </plain></SENT>
