<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the efficacy of propafenone in prevention of atrioventricular nodal reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) and orthodromic atrioventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVRT) based on the clinical results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence and find the electrophysiological predictor of propafenone effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 44 participants in a 12-month period, who were divided in two groups: group A - in which propafenone caused complete ventriculo-atrial block and group B - in which propafenone did not cause complete ventriculo-atrial block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group A had significantly lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> than group B (95% vs 70.8%, P=0.038), and complete ventriculo-atrial block predicted the efficacy of propafenone oral therapy in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 52.8%, positive predictive value 95%, negative predictive value 29.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with AVNRT in group B who did not experience the recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> had significantly shorter echo zone before intravenous administration of propafenone than the patients who experienced episodes of sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (median 40 ms [range 15-60 ms] vs 79 ms [range 50-180 ms], P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with non-inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, complete ventriculo-atrial block can be used as an electrophysiological predictor of the efficacy of propafenone oral therapy in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with non-inducible AVNRT, but without complete ventriculo-atrial block, propafenone was more effective in patients with shorter echo zone of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
