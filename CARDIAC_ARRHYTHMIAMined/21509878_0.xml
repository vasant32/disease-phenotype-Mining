<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop a system for artifact suppression in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings obtained during interventional real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We characterized ECG artifacts due to radiofrequency pulses and gradient switching during MRI in terms of frequency content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of analog filters and digital least mean squares adaptive filters were used to filter the ECG during in vivo experiments and the results were compared with those obtained with simple low-pass filtering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The system performance was evaluated in terms of artifact suppression and ability to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during real-time MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analog filters were able to suppress artifacts from high-frequency radiofrequency pulses and gradient switching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining pulse artifacts caused by intermittent preparation sequences or spoiler gradients required adaptive filtering because their bandwidth overlapped with that of the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using analog and adaptive filtering, a mean improvement of 38 dB (n = 11, peak QRS signal to pulse artifact noise) was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This filtering system was successful in removing pulse artifacts that obscured <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as premature ventricular complexes and complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have developed an online ECG monitoring system employing digital adaptive filters that enables the identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> during real-time MRI-guided interventions </plain></SENT>
