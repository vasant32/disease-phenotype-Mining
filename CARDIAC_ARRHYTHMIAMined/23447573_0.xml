<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator saves lives; however, in near end-of-life situations linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175969" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incurable diseases</z:e>, the question arises as to whether or not to turn off the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> to avoid excessive numbers of shocks as the heart begins to fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the wishes of a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients.METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive recipients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for primary or secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> were examined during a routine out-patient follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects completed a written survey about expected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> benefits, feelings and circumstances under which they would want to deactivate the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and nine patients fully completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 67.6 ± 8.7 years, 91 (83.5%) were male and the mean systolic ejection fraction was 31.5 ± 10.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> according to the New York Heart Association classification was 2.1 ± 0.59 at implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine (90.8%) patients felt more secure and safe following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and 66 (60.6%) patients reported a sense of improved health status after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (28.4%) patients had experienced an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty (45.9%) patients indicated that they had never considered <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> deactivation during near end-of-life situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This topic had been discussed with only eight (7.3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty-four (40.1%) patients wanted more information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 10 (41.7%) patients from secondary prevention and 19 (22.4%) from primary prevention groups categorically refused more information or further discussion on this topic (P = 0.058).CONCLUSION: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients felt safer following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation and most wanted more information regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, a significant number of patients (especially, secondary prevention patients) had no interest in receiving additional information about this topic </plain></SENT>
