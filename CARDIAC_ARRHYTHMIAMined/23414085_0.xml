<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) allows earlier identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its utility for detection of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac events, as well as for transient ST-segment abnormalities no longer present when the first hospital ECG is performed, is not well characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether the prehospital ECG adds supplemental information to the first ECG obtained in hospital, by comparing data on possible <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> provided by the two ECGs, in ambulance patients later diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulance personnel acquired 12-lead ECGs for patients suspected of having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic event, prior to transport to hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first emergency department 12-lead ECG was provided by medical records at the receiving hospital, and the principal hospital diagnosis for the event was extracted from chart data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two cardiologists, blinded to the hospital diagnosis, provided their consensus interpretation of 1,209 pairs of ECGs, noting the presence or absence of specific abnormalities on each tracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 82 patients who had an eventual hospital diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>, the study cardiologists identified 71 with ST-segment elevations on the ECGs they examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these (97%) were observed on both ECGs, but the prehospital ECG showed ST-segment elevation for two additional patients (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No additional instances were seen only on the hospital ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 116 patients with a hospital diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (NSTEMI), the cardiologists identified 36 with ST-segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo>: 28 (78%) of these were present on both ECGs, seven (19%) only on the prehospital ECG, and one (3%) only on the hospital ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 567 patients with any cardiac hospital diagnosis, the cardiologists identified 87 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>: 73 (84%) on both ECGs, 12 (14%) only on the prehospital ECG, and two (2%) only on the hospital ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Beyond identifying ST-segment elevation earlier, prehospital ECGs detect important transient abnormalities, information not otherwise available from the first emergency department ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data can expedite diagnosis and clinical management decisions among patients suspected of having an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardiac event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prehospital ECG should be fully integrated into emergency medicine practice </plain></SENT>
