<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent ARVC genes encode desmosomal proteins of which mutations in desmoglein-2 (DSG2), account for 10%-20% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial mutation analysis of DSG2 in 71 probands identified the first family reported with recessively inherited ARVC due to a missense mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or <z:hpo ids='HP_0010984'>digenic inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DSG2 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings were consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemistry of endomyocardial biopsies and epidermal tissue of mutation carriers, which indicated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular distribution of DSG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggested a dominant-negative effect of the mutated DSG2 proteins because they were incorporated into the desmosomes </plain></SENT>
