<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the outcome for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing catheter valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004935'>pulmonary atresia</z:hpo> with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) 21 years after the first procedure at their center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> for PAIVS is now an established procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the management of the borderline right ventricle (RV) is controversial, and there may be a place for novel techniques such as stenting of the arterial duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 37 successful valve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (total 39 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median length of follow-up was 9.2 years (range 2.2 to 21.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had stenting of the arterial duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) initial z-score for the tricuspid valve was -5.1 (±3.4), and a further 142 sets of measurements were taken to assess the growth of the RV of survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (21%), and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> after the first 35 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (83% of survivors) have a biventricular circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients who had stenting of the arterial duct, significant reductions in early reintervention (0 vs. 7 patients, p = 0.009) and hospital stay (17.4 ± 18.1 days vs. 33.8 ± 28.6 days, p = 0.012) occurred, with no increase in mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no catch-up growth of the RV in patients who had a biventricular outcome (z-score increase +0.08/year, p = 0.26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival is good, and even small RVs may be amenable to this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple interventions may be required to achieve biventricular circulation, but stenting of the arterial duct may reduce hospital stay and repeat procedures </plain></SENT>
