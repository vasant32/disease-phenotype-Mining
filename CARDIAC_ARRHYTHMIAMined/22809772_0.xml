<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to show that, in patients with ST elevation, troponin elevation, and altered consciousness, the reason may be SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 36-year-old man presented to emergency service with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo>, high level of cardiac troponin I, and neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patient's initial ECG, there were sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, T-wave inversions inferiorly, and concave ST elevations in V1 to V4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hours later, his ECG showed increased ST-segment elevations with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's troponin I value was 10 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ejection fraction was 60%, and there were no wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scan of the brain demonstrated SAH with falx sign and midline cerebellar <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (3 Ã— 4 cm in size) in the occipital region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient died on the 10th day of follow-up because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, multiorgan failure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac evaluation is recommended in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in many studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, if there are neurologic symptoms or signs in patients diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> with ECG changes and troponin elevation, requesting threshold of brain computed tomography should be low before the thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
