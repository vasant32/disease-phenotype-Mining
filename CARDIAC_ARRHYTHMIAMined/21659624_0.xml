<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vernakalant <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> is a novel, predominantly atrial-selective antiarrhythmic drug that effectively and rapidly terminates <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma vernakalant concentration data from 5 phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of vernakalant in patients with AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> and a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers were used to construct a population pharmacokinetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma vernakalant concentration-time data were best fit by a 2-compartment mammillary model, with rapid first-order elimination from the central compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median systemic clearance was 0.35 L/h/kg (or 28 L/h for an 80-kg patient), with intersubject variability estimated to be 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clearance was significantly influenced by CYP2D6 genotype, age, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentration, and subject status (patient vs volunteer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intercompartmental clearance was also influenced by subject status, whereas the volumes of the central compartment and peripheral compartment were unaffected by any covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the final pharmacokinetic model, the area under the plasma vernakalant concentration-time curve from 0 to 90 minutes was estimated to be 15% higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers than extensive metabolizers, with age and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> having much smaller influences on exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that dose adjustments based on patient characteristics, including use of concomitant drugs, are unnecessary for intravenous vernakalant </plain></SENT>
