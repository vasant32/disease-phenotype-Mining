<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence and nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in horses following general anaesthesia and surgery is poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that horses undergoing emergency surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disorders</z:e> may be at particular risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence and nature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in horses following anaesthesia in a clinical setting and to establish if there was a difference in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> between horses with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> undergoing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our secondary objective was to assess selected available risk factors for association with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> following anaesthesia and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Horses with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> undergoing an exploratory laparotomy and horses with no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> undergoing orthopaedic surgery between September 2009 and January 2011 were recruited prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A telemetric electrocardiogram (ECG) was fitted to each horse following recovery from anaesthesia and left in place for 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selected electrolytes were measured before, during and after surgery and data was extracted from clinical records for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recorded ECGs were analysed and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> characterised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven horses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> and 37 without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> were very common during the post-operative period in both groups of horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Supra-ventricular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bradyarrhythmias</z:e> predominated in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in prevalence of any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> between the horses with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> derangements were associated with the development of any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in horses during the post-operative period in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are very common in horses following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It showed no differences between those horses with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurring in horses during the post-<z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> period require further investigation </plain></SENT>
