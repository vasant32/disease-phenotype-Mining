<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To define the epidemiology of adverse cardiovascular events among women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) hospitalised for childbirth in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: The 1998-2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, an administrative dataset representative of overall US hospital admissions, was used to identify hospitalisations for delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs for cardiovascular outcomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, embolism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or a combined outcome) for women with and without CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Covariates included age, number of medical comorbidities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo>, hospital teaching status, insurance status and method of delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Annual deliveries for women with CHD increased 34.9% from 1998 to 2007 compared with an increase of 21.3% in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with CHD were more likely to sustain a cardiovascular event (4042/100,000 vs 278/100,000 deliveries, univariate OR 15.1, 95% CI 13.1 to 17.4, multivariable OR 8.4, 95% CI 7.0 to 10.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo>, the most common cardiovascular event, was more frequent among women with CHD (2637/100,000 vs 210/100,000, univariate OR 12.9, 95% CI 10.9 to 15.3, multivariable OR 8.3, 95% CI 6.7 to 10.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 150/100,000 patients with CHD compared with 8.2/100,000 patients without CHD (multivariable OR 6.7, 95% CI 2.9 to 15.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complex CHD was associated with greater odds of having an adverse cardiovascular event than simple CHD (8158/100,000 vs 3166/100,000, multivariable OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Maternal CHD is associated with a markedly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during admission for delivery </plain></SENT>
