<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, individuals with pre-existing congenital, inherited or acquired heart conditions may experience functional cardiac deterioration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> during even moderate exertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exclusion from high-level sporting activity may be mandated in some cases, and pre-participation screening of competitive athletes plays an important role in the identification of such individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The issue of screening is complicated by the fact that physiological cardiovascular adaptation in healthy athletes, including modest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> and biventricular cavity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, may create a diagnostic overlap with pathological conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, much interest has focused recently on the possibility of irreversible cardiac remodeling in a proportion of veteran endurance athletes, with the potential for arrhythmogenesis and adverse cardiac events </plain></SENT>
