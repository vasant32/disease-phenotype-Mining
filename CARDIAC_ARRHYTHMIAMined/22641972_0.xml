<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients with structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts (SNH) suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) or frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) are at low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Any treatment ameliorates symptoms without a substantial influence on survival.The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the health-related quality of life (QoL) of patients with SNH undergoing elective radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of VT or <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for RFA of VT or <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> in SNH were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They underwent 24-h Holter ECG and QoL assessment (SF-36 questionnaire) at baseline and at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were compared within and between VT and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 44 enrolled patients:(i) 23 had VT; (ii) 21 had <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> with a mean count of 18,711 +/- 10,378 beats/24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic drugs (sotalol, propafenone) were more frequently used in the VT group than in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent successful RFA with no major complications with 2 cases of early reablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, a significant improvement 6 of 8 domains of SF-36 was observed in the VT and <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> groups respectively with no significant difference in physical and mental component summary score between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Favourable outcome of radiofrequency ablation in terms of quality of life and safety supports the idea of aggressive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> in patients with structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts who are symptomatic and/or prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparable improvement of QoL in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and VT is an additional argument for performing ablation in symptomatic patients with frequent ventricular contractions </plain></SENT>
