<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to optimize coronary sinus (CS) computerized tomography (CT) imaging and evaluate its utility for preprocedural planning and intraoperative guidance by overlay of 3D reconstructed CS images on live fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Optimal CS lead placement for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) remains challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preprocedural knowledge of CS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> can significantly affect procedural outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optimal CS imaging protocols by CT have not been well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen consecutive CRT recipients underwent contrast-enhanced functional cardiac CT on a 64-slice scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CS target branch closest to the most dyssynchronous LV segment was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3D volume rendered CS images were superimposed onto live fluoroscopy via EP Navigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) to guide CS cannulation and lead placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The imaging protocol was optimized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CT images were successfully reconstructed and overlaid on live fluoroscopy in 16/17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overlay facilitated CS cannulation and lead placement into a predefined target branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excellent correlation between CT and angiographic CS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By using the overlaid 3D CS as a road map, average total fluoroscopy time (14.56 ± 4.22 min) was significantly shorter when compared to historical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total radiation exposure was significantly higher in the CT-guided group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Images obtained using double bolus injection and gated acquisition at 40 % of the cardiac cycle contained the most anatomical detail of the CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overlay of 3D CS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> defined by preprocedural cardiac CT is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It allows planning of CRT implantation and live guidance of CS lead placement into a predefined target branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Limiting the CT imaging to 40 % of the cardiac cycle phase provides optimal CS images and reduces radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This approach may result in shorter procedural time and more optimal CS lead positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the concept remains to be confirmed by future studies </plain></SENT>
