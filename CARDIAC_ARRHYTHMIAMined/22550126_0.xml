<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) became an effective therapy for patients with drug-refractory AF, and the indications have broadened to include nonparoxysmal AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data about the long-term effectiveness of ablation in patients with nonparoxysmal AF are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of catheter ablation in patients with nonparoxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 88 nonparoxysmal AF patients who received a stepwise catheter ablation (isolation of the pulmonary veins plus substrate modification) from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Freedom of recurrence was defined as the absence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> without using any antiarrhythmic agents after the catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 63 patients (71.6%) with recurrences (47 patients with AF and 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>/atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>) after the initial procedure during a median follow-up period of 36.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A CHADS2 score of ≥3 and the left atrial (LA) diameter were significant predictors of recurrences in the multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with CHADS2 scores of ≥3 and an LA dimension≥44 mm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had recurrences within 1 year after the initial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall recurrence-free rate could increase to 47.7% after the second procedure and 51.1% after the third procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term recurrence-free rate of ablation in nonparoxysmal AF was only 28.4% after a single procedure, and multiple procedures were necessary to raise the recurrence-free rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CHADS2 score and LA dimension may help us to identify patients who will have recurrences after catheter ablations of nonparoxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
