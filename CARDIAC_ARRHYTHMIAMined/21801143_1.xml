<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of variable decelerations and 8 subtypes, defined by size and shape, to discriminate tracings between babies with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> umbilical artery gases (N) and those with metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> (MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tracings from the last 4 hours from N-3320 babies with base deficit levels under 8 mmol/L, and from MA-316 babies with base deficits over 12 mmol/L were analyzed using computerized pattern recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We created receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curves (AUCs) for each deceleration subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 3 subtypes showed significant discrimination: those with a prolonged duration (AUC 0.6109 P &lt; 0.0001), loss of internal variability (AUC 0.5694 P &lt; 0.0001) or with "sixties" criteria (AUC 0.5997 P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variable deceleration met the sixties criteria if two or more of the following were present: depth was 60 bpm or more, lowest value was 60 or less, duration was 60 seconds or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other subtypes were no better than chance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Finer gradation within the middle category of electronic fetal monitoring classification is needed because most tracings, including those from babies with MA, will be located in the Category II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This analysis identifies which variable decelerations have a significant association with MA and which do not </plain></SENT>
