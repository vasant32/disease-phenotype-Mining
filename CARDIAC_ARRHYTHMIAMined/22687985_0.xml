<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> S7B guideline recommends that new chemical entities should be assessed for potential of delayed ventricular repolarization in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine a feasibility of using isolated failing heart rabbit to assess the QT-lengthening drugs in comparison with their effects on isolated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending and descending branch of left circumflex coronary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One month after ligation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rabbits were anesthetized and the hearts were removed quickly, and they were perfused with the oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution to which escalating concentrations of QT-lengthening compounds were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RR, QT, and QTc(F) were not significantly different, at rest, between failing and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During baseline, dP/dt&lt;inf&gt;max&lt;/inf&gt; was lower and dP/dt&lt;inf&gt;min&lt;/inf&gt; was higher for failing hearts than for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three QT-lengthening compounds, RR, QT and QTc(F) lengthened similarly in a dose-response manner in both the failing and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the failing nor the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts developed fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Langendorff preparations of failing hearts are as good as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> isolated hearts and can be use to assess the potential of delayed ventricular repolarization of test articles </plain></SENT>
