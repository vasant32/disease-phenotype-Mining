<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of short-term treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> on reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in isolated hearts of 6-7-week-old and 12-14-month-old female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were sham-operated, ovariectomized and treated with vehicle or ovariectomized and treated with 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2; 5 µg·100 g-1·day-1) for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearts were perfused by the Langendorff technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, i.e., <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, were induced by 15 min of left coronary artery ligation and 30 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration and incidence of I/R <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were significantly higher in young rats compared to middle-aged rats (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> severity index: 9.4 ± 1.0 vs 3.0 ± 0.3 arbitrary units, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, middle-aged rats showed lower heart rate, systolic tension and coronary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four-day E2 treatment caused an increase in uterine weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although E2 administration had no significant effect on the duration of I/R <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in middle-aged rats, it induced a marked reduction in the rhythm disturbances of young rats accompanied by a decrease in heart rate of isolated hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, this reduction was associated with an increase in QT interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant changes were observed in the QT interval of middle-aged E2-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that short-term <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> treatment protects against I/R <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in hearts of young female rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The anti-arrhythmogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> might be related to a lengthening of the QT interval </plain></SENT>
