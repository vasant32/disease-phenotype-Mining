<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a crucial target of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> is to achieve the so-called dry weight; however, the best way to assess fluid status and dry weight is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dry weight is currently determined in most dialysis units on a clinical basis, and it is commonly defined as the lowest body weight a patient can tolerate without developing intra-dialytic or inter-dialytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> or other symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the most promising methods that have emerged in recent years is bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), which estimates body composition, including hydration status, by measuring the body's resistance and reactance to electrical current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to study the effect BIA-guided versus clinical-guided ultrafiltration on various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors and markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 135 HD patients from a single center in a prospective study, aiming to compare the long-term (12 months) effect of BIA-based versus clinical-based assessment of dry weight on blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and serum N-terminal fragment of B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The body composition was measured using the portable whole-body multifrequency BIA device, Body Composition Monitor-BCM(®) (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the "clinical" group there were no changes in BP, body mass index (BMI), and body fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PWV increased from 7.9 ± 2.5 to 9.2 ± 3.6 m/s (P = 0.002), whereas serum NT-proBNP decreased from 5,238 to 3,883 pg/ml (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the "BIA" group, BMI and body volumes also did not change; however, there was a significant decrease in both systolic BP, from 144.6 ± 14.7 to 135.3 ± 17.8 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001), and diastolic BP, from 79.5 ± 9.7 to 73.2 ± 11.1 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this group, PWV also decreased from 8.2 ± 2.3 to 6.9 ± 2.3 m/s (P = 0.001) and NT-proBNP decreased from 7,552 to 4,561 pg/ml (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BIA is not inferior and possibly even better than clinical criteria for assessing dry weight and guiding ultrafiltration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
