<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The induction of one particular emotion - sadness - has shown two different profiles of autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (ANS) response that are characterized by activation, or withdrawal in cardiac parasympathetic activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether individual differences in emotion expression predict cardiac vagal reactivity from baseline to autobiographical sadness induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Respiration sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA(c)) was measured in 56 adults (28 men) asked to relive an episode of sadness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants completed an emotional intelligence (EI) test, and a measure of trait affect intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sadness resulted in cardiac vagal activation with concomitant increase in HR suggestive of parasympathetic and sympathetic co-activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual differences were observed in autonomic reactivity during sadness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher scores on the affect intensity measure and the emotional intelligence test predicted greater change in RSA(c) during sadness and recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The tendency to experience affect intensely and the ability to perceive emotions predict adaptive physiological regulation during sadness </plain></SENT>
