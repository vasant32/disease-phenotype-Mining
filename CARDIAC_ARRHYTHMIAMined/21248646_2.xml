<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Much controversy exists over the fluid composition for hypotensive resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that addition of 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran-70</z:chebi> or hetastarch to 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> led to heart instability and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the early resuscitative effects of 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> (ALM) on hemodynamics and mortality in a rat model of severe hemorrhagic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male fed Sprague-Dawley rats (300-450 g, n = 48) were anesthetized and randomly assigned to one of six groups (n = 8): (1) Untreated, (2) 7.5% saline, (3) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/Mg²⁺, (4) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>/Mg²⁺, (5) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>/Mg²⁺, and (6) 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/ALM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic shock was induced by phlebotomy until mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 35 mm Hg to 40 mm Hg and continued for 20 minutes (40% blood loss) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals were left in shock for 60 minutes at 34°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>0.3 mL (~3.5% of shed blood) was injected as a 10-second bolus into the femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lead II electrocardiography, arterial pressures, MAP, heart rate, and rate-pressure product were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Untreated rats experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and 38% mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> alone failed to maintain MAP after 5 minutes and was significantly improved with Mg²⁺ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 60 minutes, the MAP for 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> alone was 36 mm Hg compared with 48 mm Hg for the <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>/ALM led to a significantly higher MAP (57-60 mm Hg at 45-60 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The higher MAP was associated with up to a 2-fold increase in arterial diastolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>/Mg²⁺ and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>/Mg²⁺ were mildly bradycardic but not when combined as ALM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A few <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> group with or without Mg, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> occurred in the other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ultra-small intravenous bolus of 7.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> with ALM led to a significantly higher MAP, higher diastolic rescue, and higher rate-pressure product compared with other treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The possible clinical and military applications for permissive hypotensive resuscitation are discussed </plain></SENT>
