<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> affects hepatic digoxin pharmacokinetics remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we study the role of displacement of digoxin from hepatic sinusoidal binding sites by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the impulse-response technique in the single-pass perfused rat liver to describe the digoxin hepatic disposition by a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic liver model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impulse-response study involved analysis of outflow curves following two consecutive doses of digoxin (42 and 125 μg) without and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> (10 μM) in perfusate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> on digoxin binding in liver subcellular fractions was quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi> increased the peak outflow concentration for digoxin at the low digoxin dose but not at the high dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increase could be adequately described when digoxin displacement from sinusoidal and intrahepatic binding sites was included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of digoxin binding by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> was also observed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The decrease of biliary excretion of digoxin by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> was accompanied by a linear increase in sinusoidal efflux of digoxin's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35220">primary metabolite</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42098">digoxigenin</z:chebi> bisdigitoxoside (Dg2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to biliary excretion, inhibition of sinusoidal uptake may become dominant only for high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
