<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A canine right atrial (RA) linear lesion model was used to produce a complex pattern of RA activation to evaluate a novel mapping system for rapid, high resolution (HR) electroanatomical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The mapping system (Rhythmia Medical, Incorporated) uses an 8F deflectable catheter with a minibasket (1.8 cm diameter), containing 8 splines of 8 electrodes (total 64 electrodes, 2.5 mm spacing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system automatically acquires electrograms and location information based on electrogram stability and respiration phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 anesthetized dogs, HR-RA map was obtained by maneuvering the minibasket catheter during sinus rhythm and coronary sinus pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A right thoracotomy was performed, and either 1 or 2 (to create a gap) epicardial linear lesions were created on the RA free wall (surgical incision or epicardial radiofrequency lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RA maps during RA pacing close to the linear lesions were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 73 maps were created, with 44 to 729 (median 237) beats and 833 to 12 412 (median 3589) electrograms (≤2 to ≤5 mm from surface geometry), resolution 1.8 to 5.3 (median 2.7) mm, and 2.6 to 26.3 (median 7.3) minutes mapping time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without manual annotation, the system accurately created RA geometry and demonstrated RA activation, identifying the location of lines of block and presence or absence of a gap in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endocardial radiofrequency catheter ablation of a gap (guided by activation map) produced complete block across the gap in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 dogs tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The new HR mapping system accurately and quickly identifies geometry and complex patterns of activation in the canine RA, with little or no manual annotation of activation time </plain></SENT>
