<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In patients undergoing epicardial catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT), current guidelines recommend obtaining pericardial access prior to heparinization to minimize <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, access is obtained before endocardial mapping (leading to unnecessary punctures) or during an additional procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience of obtaining pericardial access during the index procedure in heparinized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients undergoing catheter ablation of VT in whom pericardial access was performed after heparinization were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and procedural data and complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were analysed for published criteria suggesting an epicardial ablation target and compared with patients (matched for substrate) undergoing successful endocardial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (13 males, age 58 ± 16 years, 8 (47%) ischaemic) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pericardial access was achieved in 16 (94%), including 2 patients with prior epicardial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean activated clotting time was 273 ± 36 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three patients, inadvertent puncture of the right ventricle caused no adverse consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An epicardial ablation target was found in nine of which three (33%) had ECG criteria, suggesting an epicardial circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison 5 of 17 patients undergoing successful endocardial ablation had at least one ECG criterion suggesting an epicardial ablation target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Obtaining pericardial access for epicardial catheter ablation for VT appears to be safe in heparinized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiogram criteria suggesting an epicardial ablation target lack the sensitivity and specificity accurately to predict which patients might need epicardial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Performing pericardial access in heparinized patients therefore may reduce unnecessary punctures and reduce the number of additional procedures in some patients </plain></SENT>
