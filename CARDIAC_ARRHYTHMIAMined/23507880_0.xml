<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many diverse data support a role of the funny current (If) in pacemaking and heart rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, clinically-relevant applications have special impact, since they translate the concept of funny channel-based pacemaking into practical developments of potential therapeutic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For example, the If role in pacemaking is the basis for a pharmacological approach to heart rate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine, a specific f-channel blocker acting as a "pure heart rate reducing" agent, is used today as a therapeutic tool in cronic stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the pacemaking capability of funny channels has been the main rationale behind the development of "biological" pacemakers, whose aim is to eventually replace the electronic pacemakers implanted today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the role of If in pacemaking implies that dysfunctional funny channels can contribute to rhythm disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This consideration has led to the search for inheritable forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> potentially linked to functional changes of HCN4 channels, the molecular correlates of funny channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review addresses recent reports where investigation of families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> has allowed the identification of specific HCN4 channel mutations associated with different types of rhythm disorders, specifically with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001688'>sinus bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The perspective of future research in this field is also addressed </plain></SENT>
