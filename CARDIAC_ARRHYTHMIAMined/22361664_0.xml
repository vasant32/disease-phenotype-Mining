<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this paper, a new feature named heartbeat shape (HBS) is proposed for ECG-based biometrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HBS is computed from the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of segmented heartbeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computation of the feature involves three basic steps: 1) resampling and normalization of a heartbeat; 2) reduction of matching error; and 3) shift invariant transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to construct both gallery and probe templates, a few consecutive heartbeats which could be captured in a reasonably short period of time are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the identification and verification methods become efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have tested the proposed feature independently on two publicly available databases with 76 and 26 subjects, respectively, for identification and verification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second database contains several subjects having clinically proven cardiac irregularities (atrial premature contraction <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments on these two databases yielded high identification accuracy (98% and 99.85%, respectively) and low verification equal error rate (1.88% and 0.38%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results were obtained by using templates constructed from five consecutive heartbeats only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This feature compresses the original ECG signal significantly to be useful for efficient communication and access of information in telecardiology scenarios </plain></SENT>
