<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A 2008 expert consensus statement outlined the minimum frequency of follow-up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 38 055 Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was variation of follow-up by patient factors and year of device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined the number of patients who were eligible for and attended an in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks, 0 to 16 weeks, and 1 year after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among eligible patients, 42.4% had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This visit was significantly more common among white patients than black patients and patients of other races (43.0% versus 36.8% versus 40.5%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks improved from 40.3% in 2005 to 55.1% in 2009 (P&lt;0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks was 65.1% and improved considerably from 2005 to 2009 (62.3%-79.6%; P&lt;0.001 for trend) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within 1 year, 78.0% of the overall population had at least 1 in-person CIED follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races </plain></SENT>
