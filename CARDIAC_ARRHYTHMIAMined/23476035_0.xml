<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nonischemic myocardial damage on coronary microvascular function in patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results- We included 49 patients who underwent AF ablation (paroxysmal AF=25, persistent AF=24) and 34 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately before and after RFCA, index of microvascular resistance (IMR) was assessed at left anterior descending coronary artery, and blood samples were obtained for analyses of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), activated leukocyte cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline, 1 day, 1 month, and 3 months after RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with baseline, IMR, activated leukocyte cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase increased and NO decreased after RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 36 subjects with increasing IMR, E/E' ratio increased at 1 day and returned to baseline level at 3 months after RFCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in activated leukocyte cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>-associated phospholipase between baseline and after RFCA were independently related to the increase in IMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 14 subjects (28.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff value of 9.3 mm Hg/s, sensitivity was 56.7% and specificity was 91.2% for IMR change in predicting AF recurrence (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions- Myocardial damage by RFCA provoked coronary microvascular dysfunction through systemic proinflammatory reaction that may contribute to transient diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may represent a mechanism for early recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> after RFCA </plain></SENT>
