<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patient data for 1536 veterans were compiled from nine databases from the Veterans Health Administration between October 1, 2002, and September 30, 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed models were used to identify the factors associated with the natural logarithm of total inpatient costs and LOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant factors associated with both higher total inpatient costs and longer LOS included admission by transfer from another hospital, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> blood loss <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, fluid and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003111'>electrolyte disorders</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, specialized inpatient rehabilitation, and higher hospital bed counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Device <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumor</z:e> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities accreditation, and the Medicare Wage Index were associated with only higher total inpatient costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with only longer LOS included older age, not being married, previous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> complication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, deficiency <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most drivers of total inpatient costs were similar to those that increased LOS, with a few exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for projecting future healthcare costs and thus could be important in efforts to reducing costs, understanding LOS, and refining payment and budgeting policies </plain></SENT>
