<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For cardiac safety screening, improved assays are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated adult cardiomyocytes (CM) and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) could be used to identify pro-arrhythmic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, five assays were employed to investigate their sensitivity and specificity for evaluating the pro-arrhythmic properties of I(Kr) blockers, using moxifloxacin (safe compound) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> or E-4031 (unsafe compounds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Assays included the anaesthetized remodelled <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> (CAVB) dog, the anaesthetized methoxamine-sensitized unremodelled rabbit, multi-cellular hESC-CM clusters, isolated CM obtained from CAVB dogs and isolated CM obtained from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arrhythmic outcome was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsade de Pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) in the animal models and early afterdepolarizations (EADs) in the cell models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: At clinically relevant concentrations (5-12 µM), moxifloxacin was free of pro-arrhythmic properties in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays with the exception of the isolated CM, in which 10 µM induced EADs in 35% of the CAVB CM and in 23% of the rabbit CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At supra-therapeutic concentrations (≥100 µM), moxifloxacin was pro-arrhythmic in the isolated rabbit CM (33%), in the hESC-CM clusters (18%), and in the methoxamine rabbit (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> and E-4031 induced EADs or TdP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> assays (50-83%), and the induction correlated with a significant increase in beat-to-beat variability of repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Isolated cardiomyocytes lack specificity to discriminate between TdP liability of the I(Kr) blocking drugs moxifloxacin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> or E4031 </plain></SENT>
