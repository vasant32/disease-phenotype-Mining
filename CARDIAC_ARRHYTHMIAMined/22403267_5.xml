<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal nationwide register based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient hospital care in Denmark from 1997 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Entire Danish population aged over 15 years without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> were identified by individual level linkage of diagnoses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 4,182,335 participants included in the cohort, 18,247 were identified as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> during follow-up, with a mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 59.2 years and a median follow-up of 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 156,484 people, including 774 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (age and sex matched event rates of 8.2 per 1000 person years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients and 6.0 per 1000 person years in the general population), with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.31 to 1.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 165,343 people, including 718 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (7.6 per 1000 person years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> and 5.7 per 1000 person years in the general population), with a resultant rate ratio of 1.32 (1.22 to 1.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For both <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, relative risks were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strata based on thirds of sex and age, with higher relative risks in younger patients but higher absolute risk differences in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>Rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> was associated with an increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The novel finding of increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> suggests that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is relevant in cardiovascular risk assessment of these patients </plain></SENT>
