<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that peaks in left atrial (LA) wall stress are associated with focal remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent LA mapping before catheter ablation for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finite Element Analysis was used to predict wall stress distribution based on LA geometry from CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship was assessed between wall stress and (1) electrogram voltage and (2) complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE), using CFAE mean (the mean interval between deflections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall stress varied widely within atria and between subjects (median, 36 kPa; interquartile range, 26-51 kP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peaks in wall stress (â‰¥90th percentile) were common at the pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) ostia (93%), the appendage ridge (100%), the high posterior wall (84%), and the anterior wall and septal regions (42-84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electrogram voltage showed an inverse relationship across quartiles for wall stress (19% difference across quartiles, P=0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on CFAE mean across quartiles of wall stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed high wall stress was associated with low voltage (ie, &lt;0.5 mV) and electrical scar (ie, &lt;0.05 mV; both P&lt;0.0001) and with absence of CFAE (ie, CFAE mean &lt;120 ms; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, peaks in wall stress and CFAE were found at 88% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peaks in wall stress were associated with areas of low voltage, suggestive of focal remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although peaks in wall stress were not associated with LA CFAE, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia may respond differently </plain></SENT>
