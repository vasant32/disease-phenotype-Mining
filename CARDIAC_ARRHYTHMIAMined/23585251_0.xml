<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, if <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> fails to restore SR, patients' management remains challenging.The aim of the study was to assess the AF catheter ablation benefit in a selected group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% and persistent AF unresponsive to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, in whom a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-mediated process is thought to be predominant.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2008 and September 2011, among 129 CHF patients with persistent AF referred to our institution, 34 (63.8 ± 9-year old, 24 men) presented AF refractory to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> with an estimated high likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>-mediated LV dysfunction according to a specific set of criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These 34 patients underwent stepwise AF ablation and were closely followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a mean 1.9 AF ablation procedures per patient and 17.6 ± 7 months after the last procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were in SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The New York Heart Association class improved from 2.8 ± 0.3 to 1 ± 0.2 (P&lt; 0.001) and the LVEF increased from 30.4 ± 6 to 54.6 ± 6% (P&lt; 0.0001) after 3-6 months of SR, with a persistent benefit as long as the SR was maintained.CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> catheter ablation in selected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients with persistent AF refractory to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> and without any other evidence for secondary LV dysfunction leads to a substantial LVEF improvement in the majority of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, redo procedures are frequent in order to achieve mid-term SR maintenance </plain></SENT>
