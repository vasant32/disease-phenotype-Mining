<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly subjected to dry or wet cupping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While dry cupping simply involved stimulation of the skin by suction, in wet cupping, scarification of the back skin was also carried out with a surgical blade and 0.5 ml blood was sucked out in each session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For ischemic reperfusion injury, rats were subjected to 30 min of left anterior descending coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 120 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show that cupping did not change the baseline heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic reperfusion injury caused an IS of 50 ± 5%, whereas dry cupping, single and repeated wet cupping significantly reduced IS to 28 ± 3%, 35 ± 3% and 22 ± 2% of area at risk, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of ischemic induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was significantly modified by wet cupping (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate for the first time in rats that cupping might be cardioprotective in the ischemic reperfusion injury model </plain></SENT>
