<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to assess the presentation type, clinical course, treatment modalities, and outcome of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009730'>rhabdomyoma</z:hpo>, associated with TSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009729'>cardiac rhabdomyomas</z:hpo> (CRs), who had received a diagnosis of TSC previously or during the follow-up period between June 1996 and January 2012, retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with TSC were evaluated and among them 11 patients (34%) were associated with CRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (45%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260037" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple tumors</z:e> and consequently a total of 29 CRs were analyzed in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 2 years (range: 1 week-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation was <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmur</z:mp> in three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> in two patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were asymptomatic at the diagnosis and CRs were detected during routine cardiac evaluation for TSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cardiac tumors</z:e> were diagnosed prenatally in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous regression rate was 31% and we experienced a complete regression of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with an echogenic bordered tissue defect and septal thinning in a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had hemodynamically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> obstruction; two of them underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other patient, who had multiple CRs, was treated medically with everolimus because of high-risk potential of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although surgical resection is the preferred treatment in most of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e>, we need novel alternative medical therapies in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients who cannot be operated due to various reasons </plain></SENT>
