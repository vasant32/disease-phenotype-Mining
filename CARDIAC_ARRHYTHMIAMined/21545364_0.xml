<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) in high-risk patients provides continuous long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of 33 consecutive patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation after BS evaluation between 1995 and 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 30 (91%) men and 3 (9%) women (46.4 ± 11.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I Brugada was noted in 18 (54.5%), type II in 12 (36.4%) patients, and ST elevation after drug challenge in 3 patients (9.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>; 70% a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>; and 56% <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> at the electrophysiology study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 7.9 ± 3.6 years of follow-up, 2 patients with prior arrest received appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 30 patients without prior arrest had a sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related adverse effects occurred in 11 (33%) patients, including inappropriate shocks in 5 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (24%) developed 11 major device-related complications including subclavian vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> (1), lead fracture (2), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (2); in 4 patients the only complication was premature battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> that required early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> replacement; however, some of these complications such as lead fractures and early battery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may not be specific for this patient cohort and may not repeat in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Risk stratification for patients with BS for primary prevention remains challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The low risk of arrhythmic events that is exceeded by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-related adverse effects should inform discussions with patients who do not have a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
