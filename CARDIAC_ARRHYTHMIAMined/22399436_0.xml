<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Advancing age is a strong risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its impact on the left atrial (LA) substrate in patients is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent catheter ablation of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bipolar electrograms from the LA were recorded for voltage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AF cycle length was determined by averaging the cycle lengths of ten fibrillatory ("f") waves on lead V(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean amplitude of the same ten "f" waves was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ablation strategy consisted of pulmonary vein isolation, electrogram guided, and linear ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an inverse relationship between the mean bipolar LA voltage and age (R = -0.58; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a direct relationship between AF cycle length and age (R = 0.74; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between amplitude of the "f" waves and age (R = -0.62; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Areas of scar were found in 15 of the 47 patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AF cycle length was longer in patients with vs. those without scar (183 ± 20 vs. 151 ± 15 ms; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Advancing age was the only predictor of LA scar (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11-1.58; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Forty patients (85%) remain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free without antiarrhythmic medications after a mean follow-up of 18 ± 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor LA scar was associated with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing ablation of persistent AF, advancing age makes for a complex LA substrate that is characterized by areas of low voltage/scar, and yet is associated with a lower AF frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LA scar did not seem to impact outcome in this small study </plain></SENT>
