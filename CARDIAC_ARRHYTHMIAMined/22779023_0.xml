<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To compare the failure ratio and inhospital complications across three age groups of patients and to investigate the effects of balloon sizing on the success and the device diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This retrospective review was of 665 patients who had been listed for transcatheter-based closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> between 1999 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three age groups: children (&lt;18 years; n = 183), adults (18-50 years; n = 337), and older adults (&gt;50 years; n = 145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural outcomes and early complications were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Use of balloon sizing was explored for its benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, failure of closure was 6.6% (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of balloon sizing tended to lead to a smaller device/defect ratio that was comparable to procedures without balloon sizing, though it did not predict the success rate (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients reported device embolization (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No mortalities were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In-hospital complications were 3.4%, with common complications, being vascular complications (1.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No differences in failure rate or events were found among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transcather closure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> is feasible and safe, regardless of the patient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A low rate of early complications was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Balloon sizing does not aggravate an oversizing of the device, but does not predict success </plain></SENT>
