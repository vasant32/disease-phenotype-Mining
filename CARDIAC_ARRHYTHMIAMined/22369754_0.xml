<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: Animals were injected at the left median nerve territory with chloralose and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At different time intervals, myocardial Hsp32 gene expression was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary heart cultures were used to investigate the direct effect of drug mixture on Hsp32 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that Hsp32 was time- and dose-dependently increased by in vivo drug mixture treatment, but not in primary cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RPP significantly decreased the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and incidence of stony heart in rats with subsequent I/R injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that RPP on the left median nerve territory induced Hsp32 gene expression in the heart and attenuates myocardial damage functionally after subsequent I/R injury </plain></SENT>
