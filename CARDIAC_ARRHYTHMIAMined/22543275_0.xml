<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies strongly link short-term exposures to vehicular traffic and particulate matter (PM) air pollution with adverse cardiovascular (CV) events, especially in those with preexisting CV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diesel engine exhaust is a key contributor to urban ambient PM and gaseous pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of gaseous and particulate components in diesel exhaust (DE) cardiotoxicity, we examined the effects of a 4-h inhalation of whole DE (wDE) (target PM concentration: 500 Âµg/m(3)) or particle-free filtered DE (fDE) on CV <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and a range of markers of cardiopulmonary injury in hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>-prone rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure (BP), electrocardiography, and heart rate variability (HRV), an index of autonomic balance, were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both fDE and wDE decreased BP and <z:mp ids='MP_0003896'>prolonged PR interval</z:mp> during exposure, with more effects from fDE, which additionally increased HRV triangular index and decreased T-wave amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>fDE increased QTc interval immediately after exposure, increased atrioventricular (AV) block Mobitz II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> shortly thereafter, and increased serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> 1 day later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>wDE increased BP and decreased HRV root mean square of successive differences immediately postexposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>fDE and wDE <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp> during the 4th hour of postexposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DE gases slowed AV conduction and ventricular repolarization, decreased BP, increased HRV, and subsequently provoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, collectively suggesting parasympathetic activation; conversely, brief BP and HRV changes after exposure to particle-containing DE indicated a transient sympathetic excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that whole- and particle-free DE differentially alter CV and autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and may potentially increase risk through divergent pathways </plain></SENT>
