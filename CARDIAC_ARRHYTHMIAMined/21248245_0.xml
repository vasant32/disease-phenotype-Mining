<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the presence of a residual iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defect</z:hpo> (iASD) after transseptal catheterization with 8F transseptal sheaths have suggested that the majority of these iASDs close within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these studies have been limited by small patient numbers and short follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there are a number of novel catheter procedures in interventional cardiology and electrophysiology that use larger transseptal sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of and complications associated with iASDs in a large cohort of patients undergoing transseptal catheterization with a 12F transseptal sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n=253) without a preexisting interatrial shunt undergoing WATCHMAN implantation as part of the PROTECT AF study were included in this current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography with echo-contrast immediately after the procedure and at 45 days and 6 months and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven percent of patients had an iASD immediately after the procedure, the majority of which sealed by 6 months (incidence of iASD, 34% at 45 days, 11% at 6 months, 7% at 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whereas the majority of iASDs were &gt;3 mm in diameter immediately after the procedure, the minority of iASD were &gt;3 mm during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, interatrial shunting was predominantly left-to-right when an iASD was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> during the follow-up period in patients with or without iASD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transseptal catheterization procedures with a large-diameter transseptal sheath have a high spontaneous closure rate of iASDs that is not associated with an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/systemic embolization during long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
