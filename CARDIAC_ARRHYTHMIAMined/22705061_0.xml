<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Concurrent supplement of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> has been shown to reduce the cardiac sensitivity to class III antiarrhythmic agent-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in ovariectomized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the underlying cardiac electrophysiological mechanisms of the hormones, present study explored the modulation of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> on repolarization and its frequency dependence in papillary muscles of female rabbit right ventricles by glass microelectrode technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> shortened action potential duration for 90% repolarization (APD(90)) whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> prolonged APD(90) and those actions on APD(90) were concentration-dependent for both hormones at 1.0-30 μM (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the action of both hormones on APD(90) was found to be dependent on stimulation frequencies (0.2-3.3Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The shortening of APD(90) by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> (10 μM) was enhanced with the increase in frequencies reaching a statistic significance at frequencies ≥1.0 Hz, whereas the prolongation of APD(90) by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (3 μM) was weakened with the increase in frequencies and the significant change was observed at frequencies ≤2.0 Hz (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, the relative change of APD(90) and the incidence of early afterdepolarization induced after by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> (0.1 μM), a class III antiarrhythmic agent, were significantly less or lower in the papillary muscles pretreated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> than in those pretreated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> has a reverse modulating affect on cardiac repolarization to that of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By acceleration of ventricular repolarization, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> may reduce the susceptibility of females to class III antiarrhythmic agents-induced proarrhythmic affection </plain></SENT>
