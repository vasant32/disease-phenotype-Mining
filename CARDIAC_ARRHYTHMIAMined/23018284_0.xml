<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and is associated with a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality, mainly due to an increased risk of cerebrovascular events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (OAC) treatment prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with AF and its use is strongly recommended in guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, its use in this patient group remains limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) have an important role to play in this context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to estimate prevalence and epidemiological features of AF in the primary care setting, focusing on ischaemic and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A secondary objective was to examine the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>' level of adherence to the guidelines for the prevention of thromboembolic risk in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective, observational study was based on data entered by 128 PCPs into the Health Search (HS) Thales database, identifying patients with a diagnosis of AF at the time of the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 167,056 patients analysed, 2,173 (1.3 %) were diagnosed with AF, with 86 % at high risk for ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, according to CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age â‰¥75 years [doubled], <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [doubled], <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the diagnosis of AF, 84 % of patients were prescribed OAC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at 2 years' follow-up, only 29.6 % were still being treated with OACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AF in this analysis was consistent with previously reported Italian national epidemiological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adherence to the European Society of Cardiology AF guidelines by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> was low, despite the high levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the end of the observation period less than one-third of patients were still on OAC therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the benefits of OACs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in AF patients needs to be improved </plain></SENT>
