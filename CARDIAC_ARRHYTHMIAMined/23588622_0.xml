<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Changes in P wave duration (PWD) and P wave area (PWA) have been described following catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that video-assisted thoracoscopic pulmonary vein isolation (VATS-PVI) for AF results in decrease of PWD, PWA and P wave dispersion, which may resemble reverse electrical remodeling of the atrium after restoration of sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: VATS-PVI consisted of PVI and ganglionic plexus ablation in 29 patients (mean age, 59 ± 7 years; 23 males; 17 paroxysmal AF) and additional left atrial lesions in patients with persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PWD and PWA were measured in ECG lead II, aVF and V2 of ECGs during sinus rhythm before, directly after, and 6 months postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion was derived from the 12 lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Prior to VATS-PVI, PWD did not correlate with left atrial size and no difference in left atrial size was found between patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF (p = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following VATS-PVI, PWD initially prolonged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from 115 ± 4.6 ms to 131 ± 3.6 ms (p &lt; 0.01) but shortened to 99 ± 3.2 ms after 6 months (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PWA was 5.60 ± 0.32 mV*ms at baseline, 6.44 ± 0.32 mV*ms post-VATS-PVI (P = NS), and 5.40 ± 0.28 mV*ms after 6 months (p = NS vs. baseline, p &lt; 0.05 vs. post-VATS-PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P wave dispersion decreased in the persistent AF group from baseline 67 ± 3.3 to 64 ± 2.5 ms post-VATS-PVI (p = 0.30) and to 61 ± 3.4 ms after 6 months (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PWD increases significantly directly after successful VATS-PVI in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was significant decrease in PWD after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, P wave dispersion decreased in the persistent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These changes suggest an immediate procedure related effect, but the later changes may represent reverse electrical atrial remodeling following cessation of AF </plain></SENT>
