<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the arrhythmogenic role of CaMKII in stretched ventricle has not been well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: We tested abnormal impulse inducibility by stretch current in myocytes isolated from CaMKIIδ knockout (KO) mouse left ventricle (LV) where CaMKII activity is reduced by ≈ 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: Action potentials were recorded by whole-cell patch clamp, and abnormal impulses were induced in LV myocytes by a simulation of stretch-activated channel (SAC) current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAC activation failed to induce abnormal impulses in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) myocytes but steadily produced early after-depolarizations and automaticity in KO myocytes in which an increase in L-type calcium channel (LTCC) current (ICa ) and a reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak and action potential duration (APD) were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal impulses were not suppressed by CaMKII inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e> whereas a low concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> eliminated abnormal impulses without shortening APD, implicating ICa in promoting stretch-induced abnormal impulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, APD prolongation by LTCC opener S(-)Bay K 8644 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> facilitated abnormal impulse induction in WT ventricular myocytes even in the presence of CaMKII inhibitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>, whereas APD prolongation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channel blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34385">4-aminopyridine</z:chebi> promoted abnormal impulses in KO myocytes but not in WT myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: ICa activation plays a central role in stretch-induced abnormal impulses and APD prolongation is arrhythmogenic only when ICa is highly activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At increased ICa activation, CaMKII inhibition cannot suppress abnormal impulse induction </plain></SENT>
