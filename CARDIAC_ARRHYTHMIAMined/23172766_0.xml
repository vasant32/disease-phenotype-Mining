<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An 18-year ongoing study conducted in a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1992 and 2009, 143 fetuses with suspected CHD were identified, and 124 babies were delivered locally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>13 babies with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> postnatal echocardiogram and six with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural CHD was confirmed in 105 infants; of these, 94 (90%) survived the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal deaths</z:hpo>, only four of these infants underwent surgery; most had additional risk factors including: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>, and genetic and other structural congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that appropriately selected infants with antenatally diagnosed CHD can be safely delivered and initially managed in a non-cardiac centre during their neonatal period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deliveries need to be carefully planned with close collaboration among neonatologists, obstetricians, paediatric cardiologists, mid-wives and parents </plain></SENT>
