<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation (CA) and minimally invasive surgical ablation (SA) have become accepted therapy for antiarrhythmic drug-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the first randomized clinical trial comparing their efficacy and safety during a 12-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients with antiarrhythmic drug-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with left atrial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (42 patients, 33%) or failed prior CA (82 patients, 67%) were randomized to CA (63 patients) or SA (61 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CA consisted of linear antral pulmonary vein isolation and optional additional lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SA consisted of bipolar radiofrequency isolation of the bilateral pulmonary vein, ganglionated plexi ablation, and left atrial appendage excision with optional additional lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 6 and 12 months was performed by ECG and 7-day Holter recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point, freedom from left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> &gt;30 seconds without antiarrhythmic drugs after 12 months, was 36.5% for CA and 65.6% for SA (P=0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in effect for subgroups, which was consistent at both sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary safety end point of significant adverse events during the 12-month follow-up was significantly higher for SA than for CA (n=21 [34.4%] versus n=10 [15.9%]; P=0.027), driven mainly by procedural complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and the need for pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the CA group, 1 patient died at 1 month of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004063'>dilated left atrium</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or failed prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> CA, SA is superior to CA in achieving freedom from left atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> after 12 months of follow-up, although the procedural adverse event rate is significantly higher for SA than for CA </plain></SENT>
