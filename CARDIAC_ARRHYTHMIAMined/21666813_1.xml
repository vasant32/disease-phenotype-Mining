<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous algorithms exist to aid in arriving at the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these algorithms are difficult to remember, and overreliance on them may prevent cardiologists from understanding the mechanisms underlying these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One distinct subcategory of WCTs are those that present with a "typical" or "classic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> may be supraventricular or ventricular in origin and arise from functional or fixed aberrancy, bystander or participating atriofascicular pre-excitation, and bundle branch reentry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will describe these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, illustrate their mechanisms, and discuss their clinical features and treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
