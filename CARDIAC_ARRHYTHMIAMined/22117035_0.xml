<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Interventricular (VV) delay optimization for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended by current guidelines and several algorithms have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, however, no gold standard has been established in the clinical routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that dyssynchrony parameter assessment might guide VV delay optimization and investigated whether dyssynchrony parameter changes induced by sequential biventricular pacing follow a predictable pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined intra- and interventricular dyssynchrony in 80 CRT patients by echocardiographic quantification of the interventricular mechanical delay and the septal-lateral time to peak systolic velocity delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dyssynchrony parameters were assessed during simultaneous biventricular pacing as well as during sequential biventricular pacing with a right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) preactivation of 40 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous biventricular pacing significantly improved inter- and intraventricular dyssynchrony parameters compared with preoperative baseline measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, dyssynchrony parameter changes induced by sequential biventricular pacing showed high interindividual variance and did not follow a predictable pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra- or interventricular dyssynchrony persisted during simultaneous biventricular pacing in 39 and 19% of our patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither RV nor LV preactivation significantly decreased the number of patients with persistent intraventricular dyssynchrony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LV preactivation significantly reduced the prevalence of interventricular dyssynchrony by 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular preactivation effectively ameliorates interventricular dyssynchrony, which persists in almost one in five CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Assessment of interventricular dyssynchrony and consecutive programming of LV preactivation in patients with persistent interventricular dyssynchrony may represent a pragmatic and time-effective approach to improve CRT in patients with inferior response </plain></SENT>
