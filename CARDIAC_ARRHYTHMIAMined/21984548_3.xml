<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we validate a three-dimensional (3D) cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique with the aid of simultaneous 3D intracardiac mapping to assess its capability to localize endocardial and epicardial initiation sites and image global activation sequences during pacing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in the canine heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Body surface potentials were measured simultaneously with bipolar electrical recordings in a closed-chest condition in healthy canines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography images were obtained after the mapping study to construct realistic geometry models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed on paced rhythms and VTs induced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The noninvasively reconstructed activation sequence was in good agreement with the simultaneous measurements from 3D cardiac mapping with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 ± 0.06, a relative error of 0.29 ± 0.05, and a root mean square error of 9 ± 3 ms averaged over 460 paced beats and 96 ectopic beats including premature ventricular complexes, couplets, and nonsustained monomorphic VTs and polymorphic VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endocardial and epicardial origins of paced beats were successfully predicted in 72% and 86% of cases, respectively, during left ventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NE-induced ectopic beats initiated in the subendocardium by a focal mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sites of initial activation were estimated to be ∼7 mm from the measured initiation sites for both the paced beats and ectopic beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the polymorphic VTs, beat-to-beat dynamic shifts of initiation site and activation pattern were characterized by the reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that 3DCEI can noninvasively image the 3D activation sequence and localize the origin of activation of paced beats and NE-induced VTs in the canine heart with good accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This 3DCEI technique offers the potential to aid interventional therapeutic procedures for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> arising from epicardial or endocardial sites and to noninvasively assess the mechanisms of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
