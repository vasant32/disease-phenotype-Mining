<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of medical records from patients admitted to two hospitals in Stockholm during 2008-2009 with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and who at discharge had a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of follow-up and echocardiographic recordings was performed 1-3 months after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2023 patients &lt;80 years, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> discharged from hospital, were screened for left ventricular dysfunction defined as ejection fraction (EF) ≤35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether 187 patients were identified and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> was implanted in 25 (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 52 (28%) patients, there were contraindications for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An improved EF at follow-up, making <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment redundant, was observed in 48 (41%) patients who underwent an ECHO at follow-up or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (9%) patients without an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> died during follow-up and out of these five patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD), they had no contraindication to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inadequate follow-up according to guidelines was found in 59 (32%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The follow-up of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> patients with left ventricular dysfunction according to guidelines was insufficient in this population and may have increased the risk for SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of patients experienced improved left ventricular function during short-term follow-up making preventive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment redundant </plain></SENT>
