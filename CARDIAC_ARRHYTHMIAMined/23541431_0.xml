<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The cut-and-sew Cox-maze III procedure is the gold standard for surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study early and long-term mortality based on registry analyses in Swedish Cox-maze III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative and early postoperative data were analyzed in 536 patients (male/female (425/111), mean age 57 ± 8.6 years), operated from 1994 to 2009 in 4 centers; 422 (79%) underwent stand-alone Cox-maze III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was paroxysmal in 38% and non-paroxysmal in 62%, mean duration was 7.8 ± 6.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a validated national Cause-of-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk factors associated with observed survival were identified in univariable and multivariable analyses in a standard Cox proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.7%) occurred due to technical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 41 of 536 (7.6%) patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was cardiovascular in 19 of 536 (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariable risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, confidence interval [CI] 1.5 to 5.3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HR 2.4, CI 1.3 to 4.3), concomitant surgery (HR 2.2, CI 1.1 to 4.1), and postoperative complications (HR 2.5, CI 1.3 to 4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gender, non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and long <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> duration did not confer increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariable risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HR 2.9, CI 1.5 to 5.5) and postoperative complications (HR 2.4, CI 1.2 to 4.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survival for cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 5, 10, and 15 years was 98%, 96%, and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Registry-based follow-up showed low early and long-term cardiovascular mortality and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This is important baseline information when evaluating current surgical and nonsurgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
