<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The matrix has diverse mechanical functions that ensure the optimal contractile efficiency of this muscular pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the diseased heart, cardiomyocytes are lost to necrotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells-termed 'myofibroblasts'-are activated to initiate a 'reparative' <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The structural integrity of the myocardium is preserved by this scar tissue, although at the expense of its remodelled architecture, which has increased tissue stiffness and propensity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A persisting population of activated myofibroblasts turns this fibrous tissue into a living 'secretome' that generates <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> and its type 1 receptor, and fibrogenic growth factors (such as transforming growth factor-Î²), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which collectively act as a signal-transducer-effector signalling pathway to type I collagen synthesis and, therefore, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Persistent myofibroblasts, and the resultant fibrous tissue they produce, cause progressive adverse myocardial remodelling, a pathological hallmark of the failing heart irrespective of its etiologic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Herein, we review relevant cellular, subcellular, and molecular mechanisms integral to <z:mp ids='MP_0003141'>cardiac fibrosis</z:mp> and consequent remodelling of atria and ventricles with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in cardiomyocyte size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signalling pathways that antagonize collagen fibrillogenesis provide novel strategies for cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
