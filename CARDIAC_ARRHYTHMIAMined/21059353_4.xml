<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanism(s) is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>) induces early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activities (TAs) via the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase-ROS-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROS production was analyzed in the isolated rabbit myocytes loaded with ROS dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> (1-2 μM) increased ROS fluorescence in myocytes, which was abolished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> type 1 receptor blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> MnTMPyP, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Action potentials were recorded using the perforated patch-clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EADs emerged in 27 out of 41 (66%) cells at 15.8 ± 1.6 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> (1-2 μM) perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-induced EADs were eliminated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, or trolox </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (n=6) and inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIP</z:e>) (n=4) also suppressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-induced EADs, whereas the inactive analogue KN-92 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi>, a blocker of L-type Ca current (I(Ca)(2+)(,L)), or ranolazine, an inhibitor of late Na current (I(Na)(+)), abolished <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>-induced EADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> on major membrane currents were evaluated using voltage clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> at same concentrations had no significant effect on total outward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current, it enhanced I(Ca.L) and late I(Na), which were attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi>, trolox, or KN-93 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> induces EADs via intracellular ROS production through <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, activation of CaMKII, and enhancement of I(Ca,L) and late I(Na) </plain></SENT>
