<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We have previously shown that exercise leads to sustainable cardioprotection through a mechanism involving improved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> replenishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine if redox-dependent modifications in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR) were involved in exercise cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we sought to determine if reactive oxygen species generated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase and/or mitochondria during exercise were triggering events for GR modulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were exercised for 10 consecutive days, after which isolated hearts were exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>/reperfusion (25 min/120 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exercise protected against infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and preserved coronary flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GR inhibitor BCNU abolished the beneficial effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GR activity was increased following exercise in a redox-dependent manner, with no change in GR protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because fluorescent labelling of GR protein <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> showed lower amounts of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiols</z:chebi> after exercise, we sought to determine the source of intracellular reactive oxygen species that may be activating GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsets of animals were exercised immediately after treatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH-oxidase inhibitors</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2781">apocynin</z:chebi> or Vas2870, or with mitoTEMPO or Bendavia, which reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reactive oxygen species levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cardioprotective effects of exercise were abolished if animals exercised in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50423">NADPH oxidase inhibitors</z:chebi>, in clear contrast to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These changes correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi>-dependent modifications of GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adaptive cardioprotective signalling is triggered by reactive oxygen species from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase, and leads to improved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> replenishment through redox-dependent modifications in GR </plain></SENT>
