<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Detailed information regarding the structure and dimensions of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is required to guide implantation of LAA occlusion devices in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, this procedure is guided by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in assessing LAA dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The LAA <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was analyzed in 21 consecutive patients (age 62 ± 9 years, five women, six paroxysmal AF) who underwent catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had pre-procedural scans (computed tomography (CT), N = 9; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), N = 12) of the left atrium (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An 8-Fr phased-array ICE catheter was used to obtain images of the LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LAA was visualized with the ICE probe placed sequentially in the right atrium (RA, N = 21 patients), in the coronary sinus (CS, N = 20 patients), and in the LA (N = 21 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICE imaging from the LA showed a LAA ostium diameter of 24 ± 4 mm and a LAA depth of 32 ± 4 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was strong correlation between the measurements by ICE and the values obtained by CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The LAA was visualized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> locations (RA, CS, and LA), but complete visualization of the LAA could not be obtained from the RA and the CS in a significant number of cases, preventing accurate measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of LAA using an ICE probe positioned in the LA results in accurate measurements of LAA dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This imaging modality could potentially be used during implantation of LAA occlusion devices as an alternative to TEE </plain></SENT>
