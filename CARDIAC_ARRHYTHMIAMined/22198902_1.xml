<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these devices are integrated with algorithms aimed at detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), which is common essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of two widely diffused home BP monitoring devices in detecting AF in an unselected population of outpatients referred to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> clinic because of high BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 503 consecutive patients the authors simultaneously compared the accuracy of the Microlife(®) BP A200 Plus (Microlife) and the OMRON(®) M6 (OMRON) home BP devices, in detecting AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BP as well as heart rate (HR) values detected by the two devices were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pulse irregularity was detected in 124 and 112 patients with the OMRON M6 and Microlife BP A200 Plus devices, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording revealed that pulse irregularity was due to AF in 101 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulse irregularity detected by the OMRON M6 device corresponded to AF in 101, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature beats</z:e> in 18, and to frequent premature ventricular beat in five patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulse irregularity detected by the Microlife BP A200 Plus device corresponded to AF in 93, to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature beats</z:e> in 14, and to <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity for detecting AF was 100%, the specificity was 92%, and diagnostic accuracy 95% for the OMRON M6 and 100%, 92%, and 95 for the Microlife BP A200 Plus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AF was newly diagnosed by ECG recordings in 47 patients, and was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by the OMRON device, and in 42 patients by the Microlife device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that OMRON M6 is more accurate than Microlife BP A200 Plus in detecting AF in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Widespread use of these devices in hypertensive patients could be of clinical benefit for the early diagnosis and treatment of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and related consequences </plain></SENT>
