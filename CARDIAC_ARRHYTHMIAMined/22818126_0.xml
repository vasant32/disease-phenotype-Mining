<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study determined the impact of CHADS(2) score on risk of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> after the performance of a surgical Cox maze procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 433 patients who underwent a Cox maze procedure at our institution was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three months after surgery, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was discontinued regardless of CHADS(2) score if the patient showed no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, was off antiarrhythmic medications, and had no other indication for anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine whether any neurologic event had occurred since surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained for 90% of the study group (389/433) at a mean of 6.6 Â± 5.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 32% (125/389) had a CHADS(2) score of at least 2, of whom only 40% (51/125) remained on long-term <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients had late neurologic events (annualized risk of 0.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither CHADS(2) score nor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation was significantly associated with the occurrence of late neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the individual CHADS(2) criteria, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were predictive of late neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in patients after a surgical Cox maze procedure was low and not associated with CHADS(2) score or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given the known risks of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, we recommend discontinuation of anticoagulation 3 months after the procedure if the patient has no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, has discontinued antiarrhythmic medications, and is without any other indication for systemic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
