<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We evaluated the viability of I(Kur) as a target for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> through the testing of MK-0448, a novel I(Kur) inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro MK-0448 studies demonstrated strong inhibition of I(Kur) with minimal off-target activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo MK-0448 studies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anesthetized dogs demonstrated significant prolongation of the atrial refractory period compared with vehicle controls without affecting the ventricular refractory period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In studies of a conscious dog <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> model, sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was terminated with bolus intravenous MK-0448 doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data led to a 2-part first-in-human study: Part I evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics, and part II was an invasive electrophysiological study in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK-0448 was well-tolerated with mild adverse experiences, most commonly irritation at the injection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the electrophysiological study, ascending doses of MK-0448 were administered, but no increases in atrial or ventricular refractoriness were detected, despite achieving plasma concentrations in excess of 2 Î¼mol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anesthetized dogs designed to assess the influence of autonomic tone demonstrated that prolongation of atrial refractoriness with MK-0448 was markedly attenuated in the presence of vagal nerve simulation, suggesting that the effects of I(Kur) blockade on atrial repolarization may be negated by enhanced parasympathetic neural tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of I(Kur) to human atrial electrophysiology is less prominent than in preclinical models and therefore is likely to be of limited therapeutic value for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
