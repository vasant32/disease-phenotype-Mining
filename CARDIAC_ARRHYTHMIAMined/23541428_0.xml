<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Cox-Maze procedure (CM) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is associated with a high rate of sinus restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the safety and efficacy of concomitant CM using an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-based cryosurgical platform only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for 250 consecutive patients undergoing concomitant cryosurgical CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative outcomes, health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Trust SF-12 Health Survey and AF Symptom Checklist) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 64.3 ± 12.1 years, AF duration was 35.7 ± 54.2 months, left atrial size was 5.2 cm (range, 3.1 to 11.0 cm; 16.8% &gt; 6 cm), 86% had nonparoxysmal AF, with history of cardioversion in 32% and catheter ablation in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant procedures were mitral valve operation in 69.6%, coronary artery bypass graft in 29.2%, aortic valve replacement in 22.0%, with 46% multiple concomitant procedures and 16% with a previous cardiac operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative outcomes were 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2%), 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1%), 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (&lt;1%), and 4 pacemakers for sinus node dysfunction (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (mean follow-up, 28.2 ± 23.7 months), and 11% were taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in health-related quality of life (p &lt; 0.001) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 24 months, 92.4% of patients were in sinus rhythm; with 82.8% in sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two-year cumulative survival was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The cryosurgical CM procedure can be performed safely and effectively as defined by the low number of postoperative morbidities, high return to sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs, and low rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, with most patients off anticoagulation by 2 years </plain></SENT>
