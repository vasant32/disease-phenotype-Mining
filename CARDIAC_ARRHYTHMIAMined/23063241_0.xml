<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The benefit of oral anticoagulation therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) is directly dependent on the quality of anticoagulation (QoA), which in the US is provided predominantly in the community setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the emergence of new oral anticoagulation agents, the current QoA needs to be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study is to define the QoA with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in patients with nonvalvular AF who are managed exclusively in community practices, and to compare the quality in the community setting with the quality demonstrated in the recent large randomized control trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, this study will assess the differences in the QoA based on cardiology vs primary care practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, multi-center study of 392 patients with AF in the community who were initiated on anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>International Normalized Ratio (INR) values were collected over a one-year period and the QoA was expressed as time in therapeutic range (TTR) calculated by the linear interpolation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred patients from cardiology practices and 292 patients from primary care were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the one-year period, the overall mean TTR was 56.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TTR in the primary care vs cardiology practices was 55.3% vs. 60.8% (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both practices had similar percent of time below therapeutic range, 29.8% vs. 29.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the primary care practice patients were above the therapeutic range 15% of the time vs. 10% in cardiology (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial bleed and one major bleed in the primary care group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during the study period in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The QoA with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, as assessed by TTR, in the current community setting remains suboptimal, and there has been little to no improvement in current clinical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>TTR should be considered when assessing the recent comparative studies evaluating novel pharmacologic agents to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for the treatment of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SUBJECT AREAS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmias</z:hpo>, preventive cardiology, anticoagulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
