<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine waiting period-related morbidity, mortality, and adverse events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients waiting for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PPM implantations in Region Zealand, Denmark, in 2009 was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they were discharged from the hospital during the waiting period or referred from the outpatient department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were tracked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hundred and eighty-seven PPM implantations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 259 patients (53.2%) required <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PPM implantation and waited a mean of 5.1 days from PPM indication to implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A lack of implantation capacity was responsible for 4.5 of the waiting days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (11.2%) developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> while waiting, primarily <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (5.0%) suffered non-sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, and eight patients (3.1%) suffered clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> followed by successful resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (1.2%) died during the waiting period before successful implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (18.5%) received the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37962">adrenergic agent</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi>, and seven patients (13.7%) had malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, reaching statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (10.8%) had a temporary transvenous-pacing catheter applied acutely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients awaited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PPM implantations for a mean of 4.5 days because of capacity problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, 83 patients (32.0%) experienced at least one adverse event during the waiting period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that a waiting period is dangerous as it is associated with an increased risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> PPMs should be implanted with a 24-h pacemaker implantation service capacity </plain></SENT>
