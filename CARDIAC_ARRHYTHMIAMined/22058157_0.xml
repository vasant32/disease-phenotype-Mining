<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As abnormal strain may drive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, we used computational methods to simulate a left ventricle with an MI over the course of a heartbeat to investigate strains and their potential implications to electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We created a fully coupled finite element model of myocardial electromechanics consisting of a cellular physiological model, a bidomain electrical diffusion solver, and a nonlinear mechanics solver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A geometric mesh built from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of an ovine left ventricle suffering from a surgically induced anteroapical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was used in the model, cycled through the cardiac loop of inflation, isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stretch-activated currents were added as a mechanism of mechanoelectric feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated fiber and cross fiber strains were observed in the area immediately adjacent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> throughout the cardiac cycle, with a more dramatic increase in cross fiber strain than fiber strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stretch-activated channels decreased action potential (AP) dispersion in the remote myocardium while increasing it in the border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreases in electrical connectivity dramatically increased the changes in AP dispersion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The role of cross fiber strain in MI-injured hearts should be investigated more closely, since results indicate that these are more highly elevated than fiber strain in the border of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreases in connectivity may play an important role in the development of altered electrophysiology in the high-stretch regions of the heart </plain></SENT>
