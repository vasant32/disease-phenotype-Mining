<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, an automatic algorithm (QuickOptâ„¢, St Jude Medical), able to quickly identify the individual optimal AV interval, has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The algorithm suggests an AV delay based on atrial intracavitary electrogram (IEGM) duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the difference between electrical and mechanical atrial delays could affect the effectiveness of QuickOpt method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in 23 CRT patients who were recipients of St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using echocardiography, aortic flow velocity time integral (VTI) was evaluated at baseline, at QuickOpt suggested AV delay and after reducing it by 25 and 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanical inter-atrial delay (MIAD) derived from echo/Doppler and electrical inter-atrial delay (EIAD) derived from IEGM were also analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Optimal AV delay was identified by the maximal VTI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients (Group 1) the maximal VTI was achieved at the AV delay suggested by the algorithm, in 6 patients (Group 2) after a 25% reduction, and in 6 patients (Group 3) after a 50% reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While EIAD was similar among the three groups, MIAD was significantly different (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MIAD was longer than EIAD in Group 1 (P= 0.028) and shorter than EIAD in Groups 2 (P= 0.028) and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mechanical inter-atrial delay was the only independent predictor of the AV interval associated with the best VTI (R(2) = 0.77; P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that MIAD plays the main role in determining the optimal AV delay, thus caution should be taken when optimizing AV by IEGM-based methods </plain></SENT>
