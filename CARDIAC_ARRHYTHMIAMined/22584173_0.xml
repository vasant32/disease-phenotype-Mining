<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In vivo measurements were made of the dose delivered to animal models in an effort to develop a method for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> using radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This treatment would replace RF energy (currently used to create cardiac scar) with ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the pulmonary vein ostia of animal models were irradiated with 6 MV X-rays in order to produce a scar that would block aberrant signals characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CyberKnife radiosurgery system was used to deliver planned treatments of 20-35 Gy in a single fraction to four animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Synchrony system was used to track respiratory motion of the heart, while the contractile motion of the heart was untracked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose was measured on the epicardial surface near the right pulmonary vein and on the esophagus using surgically implanted TLD dosimeters, or in the coronary sinus using a MOSFET dosimeter placed using a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The doses measured on the epicardium with TLDs averaged 5% less than predicted for those locations, while doses measured in the coronary sinus with the MOSFET sensor nearest the target averaged 6% less than the predicted dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The measurements on the esophagus averaged 25% less than predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide an indication of the accuracy with which the treatment planning methods accounted for the motion of the target, with its respiratory and cardiac components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on the accuracy of CyberKnife dose delivery to cardiac targets </plain></SENT>
