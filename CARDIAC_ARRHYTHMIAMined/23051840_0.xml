<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dominant frequencies (DFs) of activation are higher in the atria of patients with persistent than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), and left atrial (LA)-to-right atrial (RA) DF gradients have been identified in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether such gradients are maintained as long-term persistent AF is established remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at determining in vivo the time course in atrial DF values from paroxysmal to persistent AF in sheep and testing the hypothesis that an LA-to-RA DF difference is associated with LA drivers in persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: AF was induced using RA tachypacing (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrograms were obtained weekly from an RA lead and an implantable loop recorder implanted near the LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DFs were determined for 5-second-long electrograms (QRST subtracted) during AF in vivo and in ex vivo optical mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Underlying structural changes were compared with weight-matched controls (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the first AF episode, DF increased gradually during a 2-week period (7±0.21 to 9.92±0.31 Hz; n=6; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 9 to 24 weeks of AF, the DF values on the implantable loop recorder were higher than the RA (10.6±0.08 versus 9.3±0.1 Hz, respectively; n=7; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent optical mapping confirmed a DF gradient from posterior LA-to-RA (9.1±1.0 to 6.9±0.9 Hz; P&lt;0.05) and demonstrated patterns of activation compatible with drifting rotors in the posterior LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistent AF sheep showed significant enlargement of the posterior LA compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the sheep, transition from paroxysmal to persistent AF shows continuous LA-to-RA DF gradients in vivo together with enlargement of the posterior LA, which harbors the highest frequency domains and patterns of activation compatible with drifting rotors </plain></SENT>
