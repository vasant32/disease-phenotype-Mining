<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The existence of inter-atrial epicardial connections bridging the two atria at different levels has well been described and their implication in some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> is a known fact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, up to date, little data exists in the literature showing their role in the mechanisms of focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo>, providing at the same time clear electroanatomical and activation maps using a three-dimensional, non-fluoroscopic mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the case of a 29-year-old woman with a focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> with the origin in a pulmonary vein, manifested as a right atrial origin due to the conduction of the electrical impulse form the right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) to the postero-inferior right atrium (RA) via inter-atrial epicardial connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a three-dimensional, non-fluoroscopic mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster), an RA activation map was created during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radiofrequency (RF) application at the earliest endocardial breakthrough site situated in the postero-inferior RA changed the right atrial depolarization sequence without terminating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a left atrium activation map was created showing the earliest endocardial breakthrough site at the level of the RIPV ostium and RF application at this level abolished the atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inter-atrial epicardial connections can be part of the substrate of some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Awareness of their existence is important to the electrophysiologist, since a better understanding of transseptal activation can avoid, in some cases, unnecessary RF applications at the level of the postero-septal right atrium, with a subsequent increase in procedural risk </plain></SENT>
