<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are common in patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Atrial electromechanical delay (AEMD) can be used to evaluate development of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in various settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and AEMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> served as the study group (30 men; mean age, 33.6 ± 10.9 years) and 70 healthy volunteers served as the control group (34 men; mean age, 31.4 ± 7.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASAs</z:chebi> were diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography based on the criteria of a minimal aneurysmal base of ≥ 15 mm; and an excursion of ≥ 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter-AEMD and intra-AEMDs of both atrium were measured from parameters of tissue Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the study and control groups in terms of age, gender, left atrium diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inter-AEMD (50.7 ± 22.5 ms vs. 36.9 ± 12.0 ms) and intra-left AEMD (44.6 ± 17.4 ms vs. 30.7 ± 11.6 ms) were significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> with respect to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inter-AEMD (63.6 ± 20.1 ms vs. 45.1 ± 21.5 ms, P = 0.001), intra-left AEMD (55.3 ± 15.6 ms vs. 40.1 ± 16.2 ms, P = 0.001), diameter of the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> (19.9 ± 3.6 mm vs. 17.1 ± 2.7 mm, P = 0.001) and P wave dispersion (18.5 ± 6.7 ms vs. 11.8 ± 7.3 ms, P = 0.001) were significantly greater in the subgroup with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared to the subgroup without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
