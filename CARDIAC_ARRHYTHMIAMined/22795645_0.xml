<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The social milieu provides the context for the organism's survival, endurance, and adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mammals, social participation originates within the parent-infant bond and is supported by the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> (OT) system, whose functioning is transmitted from parent to child through patterns of parental care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human studies indicate that OT administration increases affiliative behavior, including trust, empathy, and social reciprocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine whether OT administration to parent can enhance physiological and behavioral processes that support parental social engagement but, moreover, can have parallel effects on the infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, 35 fathers and their 5-month-old infants were observed twice following administration of OT or placebo to father in the face-to-face still-face paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parent and infant salivary OT were assessed at multiple time points, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) was measured in the three face-to-face still-face episodes, and social behaviors of the parent and child were micro-coded for indices of social engagement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">Oxytocin</z:chebi> administration increased father salivary OT, RSA during free play, and key parenting behaviors that support parental-infant bonding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parallel increases were also found in the infant's salivary OT, RSA response, and engagement behavior, including social gaze, exploration, and social reciprocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results are the first to demonstrate that OT administration to one attachment partner can have parallel effects on the other and underscore the role of OT in the cross-generation transmission of human social participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings have translational implications for conditions associated with early risk for social-emotional growth, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, without the need to administer drugs to young infants </plain></SENT>
