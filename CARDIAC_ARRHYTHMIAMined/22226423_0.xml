<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted during a 1-year period with any documentation of AF during ICU stay were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, risk factors, interventions, and outcomes were collected from the medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 3081 patients were admitted during the 1-year study period in which 348 consecutive patients (10.5%) had documented AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in 139 patients (4.5%) and preexisting in 186 patients (6.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemodynamic instability</z:e> developed in 37% and 10% of patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF and patients with preexisting AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most (73%) patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF had at least 1 modifiable risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic rhythm conversion was attempted in 76% and 26% of patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF and patients with preexisting AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although initially successful in 87% of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cases, 42% reverted back to AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electrical conversion was successful in 7 (27%) of 26 and 0 (0%) of 5 of patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF and patients with preexisting AF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In total, 18% and 62% of patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF and patients with preexisting AF, respectively, who survived to ICU discharge left the ICU in AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is common but transient in most ICU patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electrical cardioversion is often unsuccessful, and pharmacologic rhythm conversion is often only transiently effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Modifiable risk factors are common among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies are needed to address the management of AF in the ICU </plain></SENT>
