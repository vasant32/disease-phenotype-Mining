<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: EMB has proven to be an integral diagnostic tool to evaluate suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and provide tissue-graft surveillance after cardiac transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality of EMB has been well established in the adult literature and reviewed in the general pediatric population, but there remains limited data for children in the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cardiology database at our institution to identify patients less than one year of age who underwent EMB between 1984 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization reports were reviewed for patient demographics, biopsy indication, procedural details and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 99 EMBs were performed, 49 for evaluation of suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp>, 43 for transplant rejection surveillance, 3 to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histology and 4 for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001706'>endocardial fibroelastosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty procedures were performed in children age &lt; 6 months with 11 complications and 59 procedures performed in children age ≥ 6 months with 4 complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, there were 12 EMB procedures (12.1%) with associated complications: 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> requiring pericardiocentesis, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and both weight &lt;8 kg (p=0.05) and age &lt;6 months (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endomyocardial biopsies can be performed safely in infants, although children under 6 months of age and less than 8 kg represent a high risk group and deserve special consideration due to the incidence of complications in this cohort. © 2013 Wiley-Liss, Inc </plain></SENT>
