<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and atrial tachyarrhythmias (AT) are difficult to investigate because of their intermittent, and sometimes asymptomatic, nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the daily temporal distribution of AT/AF episodes--<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and occurrence--by analysing data from 250 pacemaker-implanted, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221047" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brady-tachy syndrome</z:e> patients who have been enrolled in the Burden II Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were analysed accounting for the mode switch list which includes date, time, and duration of each mode switch episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi-squared tests for goodness of fit were used to determine whether AT/AF episode were uniformly distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The population analysed in the present study suggests the occurrence of a circadian rhythm of paroxysmal AF episodes, similar to that described for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, with clustering of events in the morning from 08:00 and (to a lesser degree) in the afternoon (03:00 to 18:00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of AT/AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is 13% higher during daytime, 40% lower at night (P &lt; 0.000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of monitoring devices based on daily electrocardiogram (ECG) recording could be optimized with these data, thus increasing the probability to detect AT/AF episodes </plain></SENT>
