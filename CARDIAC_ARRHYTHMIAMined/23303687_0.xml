<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Timely administration of antibiotics is believed to improve patient outcomes for several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> but has not been thoroughly evaluated for reducing risk of complications in chemotherapy-induced febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between the risk factors and serious complications in patients presenting to the ED with febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the health information system database to identify a retrospective cohort of patients with febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> who visited the ED of a tertiary medical hospital from January to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only episodes of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> caused by chemotherapy for underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serious complications during hospitalization were defined as unstable hemodynamic status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e>, newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that required intervention, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential factors associated with serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We further use decision tree approach to help analyze variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among a total of 81 febrile neutropenic episodes in 78 patients, 25 (30.8%) episodes of serious complications were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Latency of the first dose of antibiotics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and platelet counts ≤ 50,000/mm(3) were identified as independent factors associated with serious complications of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with fewer complications in patients presenting to the ED with febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
