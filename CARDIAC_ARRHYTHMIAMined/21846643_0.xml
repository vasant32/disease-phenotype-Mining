<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> have been reported to attenuate the increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) both after heart surgery and AF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the impact of a single prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose on ultrasensitive CRP 24 h and 14 days after extensive linear atrial ablation (8 mm or 3.5 irrigated tip) guided by electroanatomical mapping (NavX) in pigs with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Pigs (n = 19; 35 kg) were divided into three groups: corticoid (n = 7), atrial ablation with administration of 500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> intravenous at <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> induction; control (n = 7), atrial ablation only; and sham (n = 5), surgical procedure without ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Troponin and CRP were measured before, 24 h and 14 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After sacrifice, lesions were analysed macroscopically and histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear lesions were created in the right (n = 23) and left (n = 21) atrium of 14 animals, with no difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups there was elevation of troponin and CRP 24 h after ablation, with a return to baseline values after 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, CRP levels of the control, corticoid, and sham groups were similar at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three time points analysed (baseline P = 0.52, 24 h P = 0.21, 14 days P = 0.66) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis did not show any difference between corticoid and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this model, extensive biatrial RF ablation, per se, does not promote systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of a prophylactic single corticoid dose before ablation did not prevent systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or alter the healing of the lesions </plain></SENT>
