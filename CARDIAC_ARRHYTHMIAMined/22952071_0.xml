<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on treatment efficacy are strongest for atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, but these agents must be used with great caution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002071'>extrapyramidal symptoms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, cognitive worsening, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> may pose an even greater safety risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g., antidepressants, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>), although they may be safer options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An antipsychotic trial is warranted when nonpharmacological intervention is unsuccessful and neuropsychiatric symptoms or associated behaviors cause severe distress or pose a significant safety risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before an atypical antipsychotic is started, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to rule out medical causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and to ascertain whether any contributing environmental or caregiver factors are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risks, benefits, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient and surrogate decision maker, with an opportunity given to ask questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dosages should be the lowest necessary, and metabolic parameters should be regularly monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Face-to-face visits are important to monitor response, tolerance, and the need for continued treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients in whom neuropsychiatric symptoms have been much improved or have been in remission for 3-6 months, a discontinuation trial should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Through careful selection of appropriate patients for treatment, education of patients and caregivers, and close monitoring, safety risks can be minimized </plain></SENT>
