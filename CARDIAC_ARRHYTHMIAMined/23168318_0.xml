<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Randomized trials and observational data have consistently demonstrated the benefit of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> for primary prevention of SCD in patients with HF and LVSD or secondary prevention in patients with a history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> or aborted SCD, most of whom have HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary and post hoc analyses of trial data, as well as observational data, generally suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy is effective in most selected subpopulations, such as the elderly and patients with NYHA class IV HF symptoms, but some studies suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e> may not be as effective in women and those with severe comorbidities, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there is limited evidence for an incremental benefit achieved with dual-chamber compared with single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, the former devices are placed almost twice as frequently in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, observational data have recently shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> procedural outcomes are improved when the device is placed by an electrophysiologist and at a high-volume hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More recently, clinical trials have demonstrated that cardiac resynchronization therapy improves quality of life and lowers rates of HF hospitalization in patients with symptomatic HF, LVSD, and a prolonged QRS complex already receiving optimal medical management; recent trial results have also suggested a mortality benefit with CRT in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent trial data suggest that CRT reduces nonfatal events among mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA class I-II); however, the cost-effectiveness of CRT in this population remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, secondary and post hoc analyses of trial data as well as observational data suggest that CRT remains effective in most selected subpopulations, including stable NYHA class IV patients, the very elderly, and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent observational work has suggested that CRT may not benefit patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> to the same extent as those with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LBBB</z:e> pattern, although because more conclusive studies are currently lacking, the guidelines do not tailor the recommendations based on QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>, CRT-P, and CRT-D represent important and effective treatment modalities for select patients with HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional investigation is required to better determine which patient populations most benefit from these cardiac devices and which device, implanting physician, and hospital characteristics optimize outcomes with these cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
