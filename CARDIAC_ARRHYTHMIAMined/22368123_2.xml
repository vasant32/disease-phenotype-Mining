<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic ventricular remodeling is hallmarked by both reduced gap junction expression and increased collagen deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that reduced connexin43 (Cx43) expression is responsible for enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the remodeled heart, resulting in an arrhythmogenic substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the effect of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or reduced Cx43 expression on the formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in a physiological (aging) and pathophysiological (transverse aortic constriction [<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>]) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The Cx43(fl/fl) and Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) mice were aged 18 to 21 months or, at the age of 3 months, either <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> or sham operated and euthanized after 16 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epicardial activation mapping of the right and left ventricles was performed on Langendorff perfused hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were induced in 0 of 11 aged Cx43(fl/fl) and 10 of 15 Cx43(Cre-ER(T)/fl) mice (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cx43 expression was reduced by half in aged Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) compared with aged Cx43(fl/fl) mice, whereas collagen deposition was significantly increased from 1.1±0.2% to 7.4±1.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aged Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> had significantly higher levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and conduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> than aged Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) mice without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi> operation significantly increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in control compared with sham (4.0±1.2% versus 0.4±0.06%), but this increase was significantly higher in Cx43(CreER(T)/fl) mice (10.8±1.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Discoidin domain receptor 2 expression was unchanged, but procollagen <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> I and III expression and collagen type 1α2 mRNA levels were higher in <z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>-operated Cx43HZ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reduced cellular coupling results in more excessive collagen deposition during aging or pressure overload in mice due to enhanced fibroblast activity, leading to increased conduction in homogeneity and proarrhythmia </plain></SENT>
