<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior studies characterizing BrS patients have used highly selected referral populations from tertiary centres and prevalence estimates have been carried out using electrocardiogram (ECG) surveys only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify and characterize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed BrS patients in Denmark (population 5.4 million) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> patients were identified using several modalities including identification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish tertiary referral centres, search in public health registries, contact to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiology departments in Denmark, and searching in a pedigree database for inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> used nationwide in Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 43 definite diagnosed BrS patients and 25 possible BrS patients, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.1 definite BrS cases per 100 000 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most definite BrS patients were men (86%) and the median age at diagnosis was 48 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 definite BrS patients (81%) had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implanted and of these 9 (26%) experienced appropriate shocks and 3 (8%) experienced inappropriate shocks during a median follow-up of 47 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient died or experienced aborted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report the first nationwide study of BrS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a low incidence of diagnosed definite BrS compared with estimates from ECG surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up data show a lower rate of inappropriate therapies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> carriers than that reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
