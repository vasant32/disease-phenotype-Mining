<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval is a key issue for patients who receive psychotropic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients may have baseline clinical risk factors for QTc prolongation, and many psychotropic medications may further prolong this interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has great clinical relevance, as QTc prolongation is linked with dangerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsades de pointes</z:hpo> (TdP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We summarize current literature regarding appropriate methods of calculating the QTc interval, the association of the QTc interval with TdP, and risk factors for QTc prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then review connections between psychiatric medications and QTc prolongation, with a specific focus on antidepressants and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: QTc interval prolongation is an established, though imperfect, risk marker for TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are no well-controlled studies that assess the risk of TdP associated with psychotropic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There are limited data that selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a class are linked to QTc prolongation; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> appears more likely than others to induce this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9566">thioridazine</z:chebi> remains the agent most associated with QTc prolongation; intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> also appears to carry an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10119">ziprasidone</z:chebi> appears most likely to prolong the QTc interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in need of psychotropic medications display few risk factors for QTc prolongation and should be considered to be at low risk for TdP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cardiac monitoring for patients receiving psychiatric medications should be individually determined, based on the prescribed agent(s) and additional risk factors for TdP </plain></SENT>
