<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The triggers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VAs) leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) are ill defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the electrophysiological characteristics of VAs in HCM and study their relation to cardiac phenotype and circadian patterns using stored intracardiac electrocardiograms from implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A single centre, observational cohort study of 230 consecutively evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients with HCM [median age 42 years, 97% primary prevention, 51% with anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing (ATP)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six non-clustered VAs (39 initially treated with ATP and 17 with shocks) from 29 patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was the culprit <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 86% of cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter in 9%, and polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VA the rhythm was sinus in 67%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>/flutter in 19%, and 15% were paced ventricularly; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (cycle length &lt;600 ms) was present in 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were triggered by premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) in 72%, which were late-coupled (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-long-short initiation was seen in 2% and 26% of VAs were sudden-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> without preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> peaked at midday (with 20% occurring between 2300 and 0700), on Sundays and in May </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cardiac phenotype and time of the day did not predict the mode of initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation was the only independent predictor of VA cycle length (linear regression coefficient 0.67, 95% CI 0.02-1.32, P= 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing terminated 67% of VAs, but patients with ATP therapy had a similar incidence of appropriate shocks (log-rank test P= 0.25) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (log rank P= 0.23) to patients with shock as initial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most VAs are monomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> triggered by late-coupled <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They are frequently terminated by ATP, but ATP does not reduce the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Younger HCM patients have more rapid VAs, which may explain the peak of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in early adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The circadian periodicity is different from that observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e>, and is likely to relate to the distinct character of the arrhythmogenic substrate in HCM and its modulators </plain></SENT>
