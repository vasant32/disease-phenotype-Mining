<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the prognostic value of autonomic regulation indices for the 5-year risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 125 patients (53 [42%] female) after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> aged between 30 and 83 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The period of observation was 5 years with checkpoints at the first week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and after each year after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the prognostic value of established clinical characteristics and degree S of synchronization between 0.1-Hz rhythms in heart rate and microcirculation for evaluation of the 5-year risk of mortality and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) in patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> Killip 2-4 at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and S &lt; 20% at the first week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were identified as the most important factors for evaluation of the risk of 5-year mortality in patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (Ï‡(2) = 14.2, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity of low S (&lt;20%) at the first week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> were 76% and 43%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For evaluation of the 5-year risk of recurrent MI index S had no advantage over established clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The value of S below 20% in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> is a sensitive marker of high risk of mortality during the subsequent five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by better prognostic value than most of established clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
