<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven subjects who survived 6 months after implantation of CRT-defibrillator were classified as responders or non-responders depending on 15 criteria used in most of the previous trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blindly adjudicated data on major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) within 1 year after classification were used to calculate the predictive value of response criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for baseline confounding variables only eight criteria were significantly predictive for future MACEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity ranged substantially for clinical (32-94% and 26-63%) and echocardiographic criteria (40-93% and 22-70%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most powerful clinical predictor was &gt;a NYHA class reduction ≥1 [adjusted relative risk (RR) 4.41 for non-responders; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-11.04, P = 0.002], while the strongest echocardiographic predictor was a reduction in the left ventricular end-systolic index by &gt; 15% (RR 3.49; 95% CI 1.59-7.64, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A combination of these two criteria did not improve the predictive value of a single parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both criteria showed multiple significant interactions with baseline patients' characteristics.CONCLUSION: Only some of the commonly used response criteria predict outcome in patients undergoing CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predictive value varies substantially across different criteria, with a higher sensitivity observed for the clinical parameters and a higher specificity observed for echocardiographic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combining various criteria adds little to their prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The predictive accuracy of various criteria can be different in various subgroups due to multiple interactions with baseline characteristics.CLINICALTRIALS </plain></SENT>
