<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although Brugada type 1 ECG pattern in the context of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) is well known for predisposing to life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, it has only recently come to light that ERP, which was previously believed to be benign, may also be a marker for arrhythmogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ERP and BrS share many remarkable cellular, ionic, and ECG similarities and behave comparably in terms of their response to heart rate, pharmacologic agents, and neuromodulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent to which ERP and BrS may overlap remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present an illustrated case of a symptomatic patient whose ECG signature evolved spontaneously from ERP alone to ERP with a concomitant Brugada type 1 ECG pattern over a short number of days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case lends further strength to the notion that these 2 ECG patterns may be more closely related than had been initially thought </plain></SENT>
