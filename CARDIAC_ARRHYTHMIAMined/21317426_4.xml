<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the usefulness of continuous TWA monitoring in ultra-short-term prediction of impending life-threatening VTA upon emergent reperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive ACS patients undergoing emergent reperfusion therapy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) (leads V1 and V5) were recorded during emergency room visit and therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak TWA was determined before and after reperfusion by the modified moving average method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coronary balloon angioplasty/stenting was successfully performed in 19 patients and intracoronary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> was administered in 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary spasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three (15.0%) patients developed VTA requiring cardioversion soon after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak TWA before reperfusion was higher in patients with VTA than in those without (33.0 ± 4.4 vs. 15.8 ± 4.0 µV, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> exhibited an upsurge in TWA to 75 and 105 µV before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of VTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third patient, macroscopic TWA appeared in leads V1-V4 in a 12-lead ECG prior to VTA upon pharmacological resolution of vasospasm, although the ambulatory ECG field of view could not detect the upsurge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome patients at risk of developing VTA soon after reperfusion exhibit premonitory episodes of increased TWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, TWA monitoring may be useful for ultra-short-term prediction of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> risk upon emergent reperfusion in ACS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continuous 12-lead ECGs may be required to optimize detection of TWA, which is regionally specific </plain></SENT>
