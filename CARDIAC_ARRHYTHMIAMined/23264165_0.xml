<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effects of Sdc1 overexpression on ventricular remodeling and cardiac function in MI and explored the possible mechanism through in vivo transfection of rats with recombinant adenovirus-carrying rat Sdc1 cDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48) underwent intramyocardial injection in the marginal zone of the infarcted area immediately after ligation of the left anterior descending artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats were divided into four groups according to the solution injected: MI Ad-GFP-Sdc1 transfection group, MI Ad-GFP control group, MI saline group, and sham operation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function and collagen expression of each group were examined, and the roles of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and p38 MAKP signal transduction pathway were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the rats in the sham operation group, ventricular weight and collagen content increased in MI rats, and cardiac function declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Substantial inflammatory cell infiltration was seen in the marginal zone of the infarction area, and a great number of myocardial cells were apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The p38 MAPK signaling pathway was clearly activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rats in the MI Ad-GFP-Sdc1 transfection group showed decreased ventricular weight, reduced collagen synthesis, and significant improvement of ventricular remodeling and cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Post-MI</z:e> inflammatory cell infiltration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was reduced, and the p38 MAPK signaling pathway was inhibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Sdc1 can improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> ventricular remodeling, and it is possible that the improvement is achieved through reducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and suppressing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and through the p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway </plain></SENT>
