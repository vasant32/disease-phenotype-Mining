<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>X-ROS signaling is a novel redox signaling pathway that links mechanical stress to changes in [Ca(2+)]i </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pathway is activated rapidly and locally within a muscle cell under physiological conditions, but can also contribute to Ca(2+)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the heart and to the dystrophic phenotype in the heart and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon physiologic cellular stretch, microtubules serve as mechanotransducers to activate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase 2 in the transverse tubules and sarcolemmal membranes to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the heart, the ROS acts locally to activate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor Ca(2+) release channels in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing the Ca(2+) spark rate and "tuning" excitation-contraction coupling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the skeletal muscle, where Ca(2+) sparks are not normally observed, the X-ROS signaling process is muted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophies</z:hpo>, such as Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>Muscular Dystrophy</z:hpo> and dysferlinopathy, X-ROS signaling operates at a high level and contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Ca(2+) permeable stretch-activated channels are activated by X-ROS and contribute to skeletal muscle pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we review X-ROS signaling and mechanotransduction in striated muscle, and highlight important questions to drive future work on stretch-dependent signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that X-ROS provides an exciting mechanism for the mechanical control of redox and Ca(2+) signaling, but much work is needed to establish its contribution to physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in diverse cell systems </plain></SENT>
