<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Omega-3 (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) has demonstrated its ability to reduce global mortality, obtaining an indication for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> of the anterior wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These observations have led to the design of several clinical studies aimed at demonstrating the potential antiarrhythmic effect of omega-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These studies have given contradictory results, probably due to differences in the populations and doses used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Observations supporting the use of omega-3 as antiarrhythmic agents come from a study in patients with post-ischaemic dilatative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and carriers of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICDs</z:e>), without cardiovascular events in the last 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this population a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50733">nutraceuticals</z:chebi> containing omega-3 (Ritmonutra®) has been able to reduce the number of ventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> without modification of the left ventricle function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, a 46% reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (BEV), 54.2% of premature supraventricular contractions (BESV), 48% of BESV run and 33% of sustained or non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> were observed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant, p &lt; 0.0001).In a following study, the antiarrhythmc effect of Ritmonutra® was evaluated by Holter ECG for 24 hours in patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, preserved left ventricular function and positive anamnesis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that omega-3 treatment produced a significant reduction of ventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> compared with placebo, without modification of heart rate, intra-cardiac conduction and contractility.A recent meta-analysis of studies conducted on omega-3 and possible reduction of cardiovascular events concluded that no significant beneficial effects are related to omega-3 treatment on reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Do these conclusions exclude omega-3 as an anti-arrhythmic?We currently have no antiarrhythmic therapies showing a clear reduction of mortality, with the exception of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> and β-blockers (β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37887">adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This consideration is even more important for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in healthy subjects, when the first goal is the relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Keeping these last points in mind, the answer to the previous question is a loud 'NO', also taking into account the fact that omega-3, in contrast to the other antiarrhythmics, do not negatively affect myocardial contractility </plain></SENT>
