<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These drugs share a common target receptor bearing two highly conserved aromatic side chains, and are subdivided by the Vaughan-Williams classification system into classes Ia-c based on their distinct effects on the electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>How can these drugs elicit distinct effects on the cardiac action potential by binding to a common receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we use fluorinated phenylalanine derivatives to test whether the electronegative surface potential of aromatic side chains contributes to inhibition by six class I AADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we find that class Ib AADs bind via a strong electrostatic <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">pi</z:e> interaction, whereas class Ia and Ic AADs rely significantly less on this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data shed new light on drug-target interactions underlying the inhibition of cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels by clinically relevant drugs and provide information for the directed design of AADs </plain></SENT>
