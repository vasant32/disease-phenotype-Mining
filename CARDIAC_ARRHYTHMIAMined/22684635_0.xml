<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether inflammatory cytokines, such as serum amyloid protein A (SAA), are elevated in patients with atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a case-control study design, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines SAA, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were compared between 122 patients with AF and 63 non-AF controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 122 AF patients, 48 had lone AF and 74 organic AF; 65 had paroxysmal AF, 36 persistent AF and 21 permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In unadjusted analyses, the levels of SAA, hsCRP, TNF-αP, IL-1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in AF patients compared to control patients (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with permanent and persistent AF had higher serum levels of inflammatory cytokines than those with paroxysmal AF; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AF patients had higher serum levels than controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that SAA (OR 3.11; 95% CI, 1.12-6.05), hsCRP (OR 2.53; 95% CI, 1.17-4.38), TNF-α (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.03-3.20) and IL-6 (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 0.68-2.87) were correlated with AF (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAA and related inflammatory cytokines are elevated in AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to document elevated SAA in AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the cause of elevated SAA levels in AF patients remains unknown, elevated SAA may reflect an inflammatory state that promotes the occurrence and persistence of AF </plain></SENT>
