<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Planar biaxial tests were performed on tissue specimens from pigs at the healthy stage and after ventricular tachypacing (VTP), a procedure applied to reproduce the relevant features of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The local arrangement of the fiber bundles in the tissue was investigated on specimens from rabbit atria by means of circularly polarized light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this, mechanical data were fitted to two anisotropic constitutive relationships, including a four-parameter Fung-type model and a microstructurally-motivated model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accounting for the fiber-induced anisotropy brought average R(2) = 0.807 for the microstructurally-motivated model and average R(2) = 0.949 for the Fung model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validation of the fitted constitutive relationships was performed by means of FEM simulations coupled to FORTRAN routines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performances of the two material models in predicting the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress were comparable, with average errors &lt;3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the Fung model outperformed the other in the prediction of the Green-Lagrange strain, with 9.2% maximum average error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To increase model generality, a proper averaging procedure accounting for nonlinearities was used to obtain average material parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, a stiffer behavior after VTP was noted </plain></SENT>
