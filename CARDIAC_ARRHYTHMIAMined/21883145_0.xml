<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Growing evidence suggests that long-term abuse of ketamine does harm the heart and increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to explore the cardiotoxicity of ketamine and the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats and rabbits were divided into control, ketamine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> alone and ketamine plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ketamine (40 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1), i.p.) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> (20 mg·kg(-1) ·day(-1), p.o.) were administered continuously for 12 weeks in rats and 8 weeks in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac function, electrophysiological disturbances, cardiac collagen, cardiomyocte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the remodelling-related proteins were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: Rabbits treated with ketamine showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, slowed ventricular conduction velocity and increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> prevented these pathophysiological alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In ketamine-treated rats, cardiac collagen volume fraction and apoptotic cell number were higher than those of control animals; these effects were prevented by co-administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the expressions of poly (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerases-1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing factor and NF-κB-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased after ketamine treatment and sharply reduced after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ketamine enhanced sympathetic sprouting, manifested as increased growth-associated protein 43 and tyrosine TH expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects of ketamine were prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> treatment with ketamine caused significant ventricular myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and sympathetic sprouting, which altered the electrophysiological properties of the heart and increased its susceptibility to malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> that may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">Metoprolol</z:chebi> prevented the cardiotoxicity of ketamine, indicating a promising new therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
