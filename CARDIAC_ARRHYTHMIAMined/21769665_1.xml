<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A left ventricular lead position concordant to viable myocardium at the site of latest mechanical activation is associated with a better response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to guide left ventricular (LV) lead implantation into a vein over the area of latest mechanical activation with no transmural scar as determined by radial strain measured by non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients admitted for CRT implantation underwent MRI on the day before pacemaker implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time to peak radial strain in ventricular segments was measured to define the site of latest mechanical activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas with peak radial strain less than 16.5% were defined as transmural scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venograms were visualized to define the optimal vein for LV lead positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiograms, 6-min hall walk test, and NYHA class were obtained at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nine patients the lead was positioned at the primary target site, and in six patients a secondary was used owing to phrenic nerve stimulation (one patient), unstable lead position (two patients) and lack of suitable vein (three patients) at the primary target site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three patients pre-implant MRI changed the implanters primary target vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-contrast MRI can be used to detect the site of latest mechanical activation by radial strain to guide LV lead positioning in candidates for CRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Image guided LV lead implantation in CRT patients may in some patients change the primary target tributary of the coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
