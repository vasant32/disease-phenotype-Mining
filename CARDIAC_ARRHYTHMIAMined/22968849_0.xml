<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicentre prospective observational study of consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-commercial drivers with a valid licence were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding their driving habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 275 patients, 25 (9.1%) stopped driving permanently after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 26.5 ± 4.5 months, 25.3% of patients received an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock (52.5% appropriate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to first shock was 7.0 (2.5, 17.5) months and was not significantly different between primary and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, shocks (36.5 vs. 21.3%, P = 0.027) and recurrent shock episodes (17.5 vs. 6.2%, P = 0.011) were more common in secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physician-recommended driving restrictions were not recalled by 37.9% and not followed by 23.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the mean duration of driving abstinence was 2.2 ± 2.9 and 3.6 ± 5.3 months for primary and secondary patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Notably, 36.5% of secondary patients drove within 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (3.3%) received a shock while driving, five of which resulted in road traffic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of a shock while driving was 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient driving behaviour following <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation is variable, with over one-third not remembering and almost one-quarter not adhering to physician-directed driving restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Over one-third of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients drive within 1 month despite physician recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to establish the optimal duration of driving restriction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> recipients </plain></SENT>
