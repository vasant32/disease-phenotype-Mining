<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>Hypokalemia</z:hpo> of clinical significance, severe enough to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and cardiac dysrhythmias, is an uncommon life-threatening medical disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypokalemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003768'>periodic paralysis</z:hpo> (HPP), where an abrupt intracellular shift of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> has occurred, must be distinguished from hypokalemic non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003768'>periodic paralysis</z:hpo> (non-HPP), where a total body <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> deficit exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The challenge for emergency physicians is to swiftly and accurately differentiate disease etiology and institute prompt treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aggressive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> repletion, required in non-HPP etiologies, may predispose HPP patients to dangerous and potentially fatal rebound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> as the intracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> shift resolves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Describe the process by which HPP and non-HPP can be differentiated on clinical and laboratory grounds leading to appropriate resuscitation from severe and clinically relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002028'>Chronic diarrhea</z:hpo> syndromes and possibly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alkaline phosphatase levels alert the clinician to the potential for non-HPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A case of HIV/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-associated isospora belli diarrheal illness with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> of the non-HPP type is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Historical, laboratory, and clinical findings, which assisted in the differentiation from HPP, are emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical progression and treatment strategies, as well as electrocardiogram findings with T-U-P fusion waves, are described in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The history, especially the time course of disease, is essential in differentiating HPP and non-HPP, allowing treatment to proceed without overcorrection and rebound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0497442" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other infectious diseases</z:e> have been linked to non-HPP, to our knowledge this is the first report linking non-HPP to isospora belli diarrheal illness </plain></SENT>
