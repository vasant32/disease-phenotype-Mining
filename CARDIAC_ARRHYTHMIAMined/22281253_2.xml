<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors that predict malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (MVA) in Lamin A/C (LMNA) mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: LMNA mutations cause a variety of clinical phenotypes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and conduction disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many LMNA mutation carriers have a poor prognosis, because of a high frequency of MVA and progression to end-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear how to identify mutation carriers that are at risk for MVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicenter cohort of 269 LMNA mutation carriers, we evaluated risk factors for MVA, defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo>, resuscitation, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a median follow-up period of 43 months (interquartile range: 17 to 101 months), 48 (18%) persons experienced a first episode of MVA: 11 persons received successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 25 received appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> treatment, and 12 persons died suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for MVA were nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45% at the first clinical contact, male sex, and non-missense mutations (ins-del/truncating or mutations affecting splicing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MVA occurred only in persons with at least 2 of these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a cumulative risk for MVA per additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of LMNA mutations with a high risk of MVA can be identified using these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This facilitates selection of LMNA mutation carriers who are most likely to benefit from an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
