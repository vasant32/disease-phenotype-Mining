<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We constructed networks of human ventricular time series with the visibility graph approach to study the network subgraph phenomenon and motif ranks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our results show that different dominant motifs exist as an effective indicator in distinguishing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillations</z:hpo> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythms of a subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We verify the reliability of our findings in a large database with different time lengths and sampling frequencies, and design an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillations</z:hpo> with reliable verifications </plain></SENT>
