<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: Clinical reports describe life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> after environmental exposure to <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO) or accidental CO poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous case studies describe disruption of repolarization and prolongation of the QT interval, yet the mechanisms underlying CO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To understand the cellular basis of CO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and to identify an effective therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patch-clamp electrophysiology and confocal Ca(2+) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) imaging in isolated ventricular myocytes was performed together with protein S-nitrosylation to investigate the effects of CO at the cellular and molecular levels, whereas telemetry was used to investigate effects of CO on electrocardiogram recordings in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CO increased the sustained (late) component of the inward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current, resulting in prolongation of the action potential and the associated intracellular Ca(2+) transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In more than 50% of myocytes these changes progressed to early after-depolarization-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CO elevated NO levels in myocytes and caused S-nitrosylation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel, Na(v)1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> proarrhythmic effects of CO were abolished by the NO synthase inhibitor l-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, and reversed by ranolazine, an inhibitor of the late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ranolazine also corrected QT variability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by CO in vivo, as monitored by telemetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the proarrhythmic effects of CO arise from activation of NO synthase, leading to NO-mediated nitrosylation of Na(V)1.5 and to induction of the late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also show that the antianginal drug ranolazine can abolish CO-induced early after-depolarizations, highlighting a novel approach to the treatment of CO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
