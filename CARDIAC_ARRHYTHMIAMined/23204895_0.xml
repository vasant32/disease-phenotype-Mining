<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As an alternative, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> has been an interesting and potentially useful agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> produces poor image quality and has been associated with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in small case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is no consensus about the maximal allowable dose that can be administered to a patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present report, a successful combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> contrast with a power injector that produced adequate image quality in a patient with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> contrast is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The case was complicated by the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> when damping occurred during injection of contrast into the right coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This complication has been reported previously with intracoronary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The report is followed by a brief literature review </plain></SENT>
