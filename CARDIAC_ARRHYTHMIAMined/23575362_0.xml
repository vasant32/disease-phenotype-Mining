<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Mutations in genes encoding the L-type cardiac calcium channel (LTCC) are associated with various types of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e> (BrS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the frequency in Asian populations remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to elucidate disease-causing mutations in LTCC-related genes in Japanese patients diagnosed as BrS or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (IVF), early repolarization syndrome, short QT syndrome, and compare them with those carrying SCN5A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods and Results: We screened CACNA1C and CACNB2b in 312 probands and compared the clinical characteristics between probands with gene mutations in CACNA1C or SCN5A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In results, we identified 6 CACNA1C mutations in 7 unrelated probands and SCN5A mutations in 20 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no CACNB2b mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In topology, half of the mutations were located in the C-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 7 CACNA1C mutation carriers, 2 were female and 3 were symptomatic; 2 patients were resuscitated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, and 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with SCN5A mutation carriers, there were no significant differences in the ECG characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 of 3 symptomatic CACNA1C patients were female, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female SCN5A mutation carriers remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We identified 6 CACNA1C mutations in BrS and IVF patients and their phenotypes were varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although mutation frequency was not high, screening of LTCC channel genes may be clinically important to prevent unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
