<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There have recently been significant increases in the prevalence of systemic invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the number of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal drugs</z:chebi> on the market is limited in comparison to the number of available <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36047">antibacterial drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This fact, coupled with the increased frequency of cross-resistance, makes it necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination drug therapies have become one of the most widely used and effective strategies to alleviate this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMD</z:e>) is classically used for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and is the drug of choice for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown broad antifungal activity of the drug when administered in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (FLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we induced resistance to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> in six strains of Candida tropicalis and evaluated potential synergism between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of drug interaction was determined by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration and by performing flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, when administered in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>, exhibits activity against strains of C. tropicalis that are resistant to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>, which most likely occurs via changes in the integrity of the yeast cell membrane and the generation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction, and DNA damage that could lead to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
