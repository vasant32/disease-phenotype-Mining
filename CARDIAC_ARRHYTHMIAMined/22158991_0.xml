<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from congenital and anatomical alterations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is the most common agent causing myocardial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a sudden decrease in oxygen concentration alters cardiomyocyte function and compromises cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The calcium handling machinery, which regulates the main functional features of a cardiomyocyte, is heavily compromised during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hypoxic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alterations in calcium dynamics have been linked to both short- and long-term consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this perspective, we aimed at investigating the calcium dynamics in functional cardiomyocytes during the early phase of a hypoxic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we developed a microfluidic system specifically designed for controlling fast oxygen concentration dynamics through a gas micro-exchanger allowing in line analysis of intracellular calcium concentration by confocal microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experimental results show that exposure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51103">Fluo-4</z:chebi> loaded neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to hypoxic conditions induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such behavior was reversible and was detected for hypoxic levels below 5% of oxygen partial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed changes in Ca(2+) dynamics were mimicked using specific L-type Ca(2+) channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, suggesting that alterations in calcium channel function occur at low oxygen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reversible alteration in ion channel function, that takes place in response to changes in cellular oxygen, might represent an adaptive mechanism of cardiopreservation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
