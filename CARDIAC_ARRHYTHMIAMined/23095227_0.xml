<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein reconnection after electrical isolation is commonly observed in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation and is associated with recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> test was been performed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dormant conduction immediately after pulmonary vein isolation at index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the utility of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> test at repeat procedure has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We report 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> cases without any structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in which dormant thoracic vein conduction was associated with recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone circumferential ipsilateral pulmonary vein isolation at the index procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superior vena cava isolation was performed if superior vena cava-triggered <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the index procedure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> test did not provoke venous reconduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the repeat procedure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> provoked clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 4 out of 5 cases after transient reconnection between culprit thoracic vein and atrium despite absence of reconnection at the start of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the elimination of the dormant conduction gaps, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were free from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> provokes dormant thoracic vein conduction associated with the late recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias after previous thoracic vein isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> provocation test can specifically help identify and target the cause of recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
