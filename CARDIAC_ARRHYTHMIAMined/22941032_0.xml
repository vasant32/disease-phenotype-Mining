<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on retrospective data from 163 genotyped patients treated with oral flecainide for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachyarrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CYP2D6 genotype was categorized as CYP2D6 homozygous extensive metabolizers (hom-EMs; n=57), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (het-EMs; n=79), and intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers (IMs/PMs; n=27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate, body weight, female sex, and aging were important factors for estimating flecainide clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The metabolic clearance was decreased age dependently in a curvilinear fashion, where the lower clearance was observed in greater than 60 years for het-EMs and greater than 55 years for IMs/PMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction in metabolic clearance in elderly (70 years) patients compared with middle-aged (52 years) patients was different among the CYP2D6 genotype groups: 22.1 and 49.5% in CYP2D6 het-EMs and IMs/PMs, respectively, and no change in hom-EMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 11.4% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in elderly patients compared with middle-aged patients corresponded to 6.1% decline in flecainide clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the age-related decline in flecainide clearance was 6.1% in hom-EMs, 16.3% in het-EMs, and 28.9% in IMs/PMs groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CYP2D6 genotype is a determinant factor of age-related decline in flecainide clearance </plain></SENT>
