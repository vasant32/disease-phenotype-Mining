<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes these interactions, centering the observations on an isthmus of myocardium between two radiofrequency (RF) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In nine isolated rabbit hearts, a gap of preserved myocardium was established between two RF lesions in the anterolateral left ventricle (LV) wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before, during, and after increasing the spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> by local myocardial stretching, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> epicardial recordings were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local stretch in the anterior LV wall decreased the excitable window (17 ± 7 ms vs 26 ± 7 ms; P &lt; 0.05) and increased the dominant frequency (DFr; 18.9 ± 5.0 Hz vs 15.2 ± 3.6 Hz; P &lt; 0.05) in this zone, without changes in the non-stretched posterolateral zone (25 ± 4 ms vs 27 ± 6 ms, ns and 14.1 ± 2.7 Hz vs 14.3 ± 3.0 Hz, ns) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DFr ratio at both sides of the gap was inversely correlated to the excitable window ratio (R = -0.57; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before (31% vs 26%), during (29% vs 22%), and after stretch suppression (35% vs 25%), the wavefronts passing through the gap from the posterolateral to the anterior LV wall were seen to predominate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of wavefronts that passed from the anterior to the posterolateral LV wall was related to the excitable window in this zone (R = 0.41; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> acceleration induced in the stretched zone does not increase the flow of wavefronts toward the non-stretched zone in the adjacent gap of preserved myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of significant changes in the electrophysiological parameters of the non-stretched myocardium limits the arrival of wavefronts in this zone </plain></SENT>
