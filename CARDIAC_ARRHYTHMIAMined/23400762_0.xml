<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New data show that dyads vary greatly in both structure and in their associated molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dyads can contain varying numbers of type 2 ryanodine receptor (RYR2) clusters that range in size from one to hundreds of tetramers and they can adopt numerous orientations other than the expected checkerboard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of Cav1.2 with RYR2, which defines the couplon, is not absolute, leading to a number of scenarios such as dyads without couplons and those in which only a fraction of the clusters are in couplons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different dyads also vary in the transporters and exchangers with which they are associated producing functional differences that amplify their structural diversity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The essential role of proteins, such as junctophilin-2, calsequestrin, triadin, and junctin that maintain both the functional and structural integrity of the dyad have recently been elucidated giving a new mechanistic understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, failure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
