<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The insulation of St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jude Medical Riata® leads contains a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) liner, <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tubing, and ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) coating on individual cable conductors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ETFE has sufficient dielectric strength to assure electrical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This investigation intended to analyze performance of leads with and without externalized conductors and with intact and breached ETFE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Testing was performed on ETFE-coated conductors to determine their ability to deliver high-voltage therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tests were performed on samples under different conditions and current leakage was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high-voltage test and a cyclic pulse test were performed, and the effect of lead modifications on the potential gradient from a high-voltage shock was used to determine functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements from modified Riata® leads were compared with a control lead with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> insulation and conducting elements intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Current leakage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions tested, was within the acceptance criteria for the high-voltage test and the cyclic pulse test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conductors that underwent cyclic testing, the highest value of current leakage was within the limit of acceptability for both phases of the test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing of leads with externalized conductors and breached ETFE showed similar potential gradients compared with a control lead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Testing of ETFE-coated conductors following multiple preconditioning steps showed that ETFE serves as a redundant layer of insulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the event that the ETFE coating is breached, the potential gradient seen resulting from a high-voltage defibrillation shock was similar to a lead with no breach to the ETFE, even after 100 shocks </plain></SENT>
