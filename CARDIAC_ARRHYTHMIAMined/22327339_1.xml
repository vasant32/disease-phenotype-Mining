<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) generates an inward electrical current during SR-Ca(2+) release, thus possibly promoting afterdepolarizations of the action potential (AP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used transgenic mice 12.5Â weeks or younger with cardiomyocyte-directed overexpression of NCX (NCX-Tg) to study the proarrhythmic potential and mechanisms of enhanced NCX activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NCX-Tg exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echocardiographic left ventricular function and heart/body weight ratio, while the QT interval was prolonged in surface ECG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Langendorff-perfused NCX-Tg, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) hearts, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APs and ionic currents were measured in isolated cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cell capacitance was unaltered between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APs were prolonged in NCX-Tg versus WT myocytes along with voltage-activated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents (K(v)) not being reduced but even increased in amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During abrupt changes in pacing cycle length, early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were frequently recorded in NCX-Tg but not in WT myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next to EADs, delayed afterdepolarizations (DAD) triggering spontaneous APs (sAPs) occurred in NCX-Tg but not in WT myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To test whether sAPs were associated with spontaneous Ca(2+) release (sCR), Ca(2+) transients were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the absence of sAPs in WT, sCR was observed in myocytes of both genotypes suggesting a facilitated translation of sCR into DADs in NCX-Tg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, sCR was more frequent in NCX-Tg as compared to WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Myocardial protein levels of Ca(2+)-handling proteins were not different between groups except the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor (RyR), which was increased in NCX-Tg versus WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NCX overexpression is proarrhythmic in a non-failing environment even in the absence of reduced K(V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms are: (1) occurrence of EADs due to delayed repolarization; (2) facilitated translation from sCR into DADs; (3) proneness to sCR possibly caused by altered Ca(2+) handling and/or increased RyR expression </plain></SENT>
