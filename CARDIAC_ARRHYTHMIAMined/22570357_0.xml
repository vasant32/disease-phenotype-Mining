<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) shock is a critical event to patients associated with well-being after implantation, although other factors may play an equally important role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the association of shock and the patient's preimplantation personality with health status, using a prospective study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutively implanted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> patients (n=383; 79% men) completed the Type D Scale at baseline and the Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 23.5% had a Type D personality and 13.8% received a shock during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shocked patients reported significantly poorer health status, as did Type D patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Health status patterns were poorest in patients with combined Type D personality and shock during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Shock during follow-up was a significant independent associate of poorer health status for 4 of 8 subscales of the SF-36 and the Mental Component Summary (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;.05), with shocked patients scoring between 2.60 to 13.30 points lower than nonshocked patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type D personality was an independent associate of poor postimplantation health status for 6 of 8 of the SF-36 subscales and the Mental Component Summary, with Type D patients scoring between 2.12 to 8.02 points lower, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock and the patient's preimplantation personality disposition were equally important associates of health status 12 months after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of the patient's personality profile before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation may help identify subsets of patients who may need additional care, for example, with a psychosocial component </plain></SENT>
