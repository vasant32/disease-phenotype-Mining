<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether unipolar and bipolar EGM characteristics predict exit block during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:  Twenty patients (63 ± 7 years; 14 males [70%]) undergoing PVI with a circular mapping catheter (CMC) placed outside each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostium were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After entrance block was achieved, pacing at each bipole around the CMC was performed to assess for absence of atrial capture (exit block) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bipolar EGMs recorded before pacing were examined for voltage, duration, fractionation, and monophasic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unipolar EGMs were examined for positive and negative amplitude, PQ segment elevation, fractionation, and monophasic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of these parameters with atrial capture (absence of exit block) at each site was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After achievement of entrance block, only 23 of 64 PV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7772">antra</z:chebi> (36%) exhibited exit block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unipolar EGMs at sites with persistent capture were more likely to be fractionated and had larger negative deflections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bipolar EGMs at sites with persistent capture showed higher amplitude, longer duration, were more likely to be fractionated, and were less likely to be monophasic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate logistic regression model, bipolar and unipolar fractionation, bipolar duration, and lack of bipolar monophasic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were independently associated with persistent atrial capture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:  Specific unipolar and bipolar EGM characteristics are associated with left atrium capture after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> antral isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These parameters might be useful in predicting the need for further ablation to achieve exit block </plain></SENT>
