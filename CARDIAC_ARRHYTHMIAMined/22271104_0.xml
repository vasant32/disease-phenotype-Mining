<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence and nature of cardiac involvement in BD are not yet clearly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate left atrial (LA) volume and functions using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients without any cardiac symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 40 BD (16 females, 24 males and mean age of 33±7 years) and 30 healthy (11 females, 19 males and mean age of 35±6 years) subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients' demographic parameters such as age, gender, and duration of BD were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the individuals underwent comprehensive 2D echocardiography examination, and RT3DE was performed to assess LA volumes and mechanical functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LA maximum volume (Vmax) and before atrial contraction volume (Vpre A), LA active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes (TSV), total emptying and active emptying fractions and expansion index were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients when compared with the controls (P&lt;0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LA passive emptying fraction was significantly lower in the patients with BD than in the controls (41±7 vs. 44±5, P=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were positive correlations between TSV and high-sensitive C-reactive protein level (r=0.413, P=0.008), TSV, and disease duration (r=0.417, P&lt;0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that LA mechanical functions and volumes are impaired in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results may be an early form of subclinical cardiac involvement in patients with BD who have no clinical evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
