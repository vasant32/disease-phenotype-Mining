<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in signal-processing technology, which have enabled fetal monitoring during pregnancy using abdominal electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, ubiquitous fetal health monitoring is still unfeasible due to the computational complexity of noise-robust solutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, an ECG R-peak detection algorithm for ambulatory R-peak detection is proposed, as part of a fetal ECG detection algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proposed algorithm is optimized to reduce computational complexity, without reducing the R-peak detection performance compared to the existing R-peak detection schemes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation of the algorithm is performed on three manually annotated datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a detection error rate of 0.23%, 1.32% and 9.42% on the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>/BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and in-house maternal and fetal databases, respectively, the detection rate of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the best state-of-the-art algorithms, at a reduced computational complexity </plain></SENT>
