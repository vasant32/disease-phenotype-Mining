<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Lobar lung transplantation is an option that provides the possibility of transplanting an urgent listed recipient of small size with a size-mismatched donor lung by surgically reducing the size of the donor lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our short- and long-term results with bilateral lobar lung transplantation (BLLT) and compare it with the long-term outcomes of our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analyses of 75 lung transplant recipients who received downsized lungs with a special focus on 23 recipients with BLLT performed since January 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative surgical complications, lung function tests, late complications and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decision to perform lobar transplantation was considered during allocation and finally decided prior to implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> was the most common indication (43.5%) followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at transplantation was 41 (range 13-66) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the transplantations (83%) were done with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; 3 of them were already on ECMO prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no 30-day or in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No bronchial complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common early complication was haematothorax (39%), which required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rate of postoperative atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Forced expiratory volumes in 1 s (% predicted) at 1 and 2 years were 76 ± 23 and 76 ± 22, respectively (mean ± standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By 2-year follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> syndrome was documented in 3 patients with a median follow-up of 1457 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Overall survivals at 1 and 5 years were 82 ± 8 and 64 ± 11%, respectively and were comparable with those of 219 other recipients who received bilateral lung transplantation during the same period (log rank test, P = 0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that BLLT has short- and long-term outcomes comparable with those of standard bilateral lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The limitation of lung transplantation due to size-mismatch, particularly in smaller recipients, could be overcome by utilizing lobar lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
