<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Background: Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin that supports the survival and differentiation of sympathetic neurons, and its increased expression after myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was correlated with cardiac sympathetic hyperinnervation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether NGF protects the heart during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to address this issue in rat heart exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion injury (IRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: NGF was administered intravenously (IV), 15 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, at different concentrations in the absence or presence of inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) or nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) in different groups of rats (n=6) with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> for 30 min followed by 120-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area at risk and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> to risk ratios were determined from sections stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenylterazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: NGF treatment at doses of 0.015-15 μg/kg, with an optimal dose of 0.15 μg/kg given IV before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, reduced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size from about 60% at the area of risk to about 25%, indicating cardioprotection by about 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>-sparing effects of NGF were partially abolished by the inhibition of PI3K and NOS using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that NGF attenuates myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> damage in an in vivo rat model of myocardial regional IRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cardioprotective effect is proposed to be related to the activities of PI3K and NOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that NGF has a potential therapeutic role in the treatment of IRI </plain></SENT>
