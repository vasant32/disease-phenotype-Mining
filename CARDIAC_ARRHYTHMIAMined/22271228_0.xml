<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting results as to the occurrence of high QT dispersion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to further investigate repolarization dynamics and other repolarization-associated pro-arrhythmogenic markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore repolarization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, patients who responded well to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and patients who had not responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, yet were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>-free, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate whether increased inflammatory burden, a characteristic of non-responsive patients, was specifically associated with abnormal repolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Included in the study were 53 FMF patients (27 colchicine non-responders) and 53 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiograms were performed under strict standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QT variability parameters were computed with custom-made computer software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in any of the QT dynamic parameters was found in either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> group compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean values of QT variability index, regardless of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response, were similar to previously published results for healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> who are continuously treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and have not developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, regardless of their clinical response, have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QT variability parameters, indicating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> repolarization dynamics and suggesting no increased risk of repolarization-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
