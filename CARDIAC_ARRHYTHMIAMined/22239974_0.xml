<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of 2 different methodological approaches (i.e. talking baseline or transfer function) was explored as respiratory control during talking tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RSA was collected during resting baseline, talking baseline, and interview conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjective reports of distress were higher in the interview than in the other 2 conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean RSA levels were significantly lower in the 2 talking tasks than in the resting baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After applying a transfer function for respiratory control, there were no significant differences between the 3 conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderator analyses yielded lower RSA values in the talking baseline and interview conditions for participants who reported greater distress during the interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that respiratory controls are likely necessary when using RSA in talking paradigms and that both approaches appeared to be adequate </plain></SENT>
