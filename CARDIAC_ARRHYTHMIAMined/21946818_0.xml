<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the short-term rate-controlling effects of CP and PP during AF with rapid ventricular rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen patients with ongoing, spontaneous AF were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mechanical pulse rate was registered via arterial pressure tracings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During CP a coupling interval (CI) of ERP+20 ms was used to reach an optimal haemodynamic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paired pacing was started at a basic cycle length (CL) of 500 ms followed by an extrastimulus with an CI of ERP+20 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drive train was changed at 50 ms increments until the lowest MPR was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proarrhythmic effects were characterized by the number of premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanical pulse rate significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during CP (113 ± 9 vs. 58 ± 4/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using CP the controlled rhythm remained irregular (CL range: 896 ± 24-1452 ± 67 ms) while no <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With different drive trains PP resulted in different regular MPRs (range 62 ± 6-80 ± 4/min), but the lowest MPR achieved was significantly higher in the PP group than in the CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Paired pacing caused premature beats in nine patients (56%) resulting in loss of continuous MPR control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both CP and PP can reduce the MPR during rapidly conducting AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Coupled pacing is more applicable, but PP has the advantage to achieve different target heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Paired pacing has more proarrhythmic effects as compared with CP </plain></SENT>
