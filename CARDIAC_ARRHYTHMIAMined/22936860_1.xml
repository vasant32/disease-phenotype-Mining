<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of different psychotropic agents have been associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, and these relationships have been difficult to interpret due to the presence of confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been renewed interest in the potential for certain antidepressants to cause QT prolongation, which is a predisposing factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the optimum means of determining QT remains contentious due to discrepancies between methods that may be readily applied in a clinical setting versus more detailed techniques during regulatory assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of different pharmacological mechanisms might explain the occurrence of adverse cardiac effects, and these differ according to the type of antidepressant agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emerging data indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3723">citalopram</z:chebi> exhibits a dose-effect relationship for QT prolongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas cardiotoxicity is readily apparent in the context of intentional antidepressant overdose, the occurrence of cardiac effects as a result of therapeutic administration is less certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> and other factors that independently predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> are important considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clinical judgment is needed to evaluate the overall risk or benefit of a particular antidepressant in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Close monitoring should be considered for those at greatest risk of QT prolongation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
