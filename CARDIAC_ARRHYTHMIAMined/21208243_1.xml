<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> has a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize the long-term freedom from atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients undergoing RFA for AFL late after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological assessment included multipolar activation, entrainment, and electroanatomic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical, electrocardiograph, and Holter monitoring follow-up was conducted every 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 53 ± 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time from surgical repair to RFA was 29 ± 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had CTI-dependent AFL (20/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 1.6 ± 0.7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> per patient; other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> included non-CTI-dependent AFL (14), focal atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (two), and atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (two)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> success was obtained in 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients with recurrent AFL (three CTI dependent, two non-CTI dependent) at 13 ± 8 months had successful repeat RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 3.2 ± 1.6 years follow-up since the last procedure, 90% of patients with successful RFA for AFL remained free of their clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, 30% of the original 20 patients had documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) 2.1 ± 1.6 years after the last procedure; five (25%) required AF intervention </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RFA of AFL occurring late after surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> repair has a low long-term risk of recurrence, although 25% of patients required two procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, there is a high late incidence of AF (30%), with an additional 25% of patients requiring intervention for AF </plain></SENT>
