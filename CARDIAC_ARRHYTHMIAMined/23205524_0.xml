<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less is known about the associated emotional sequelae surrounding controllable versus uncontrollable positive emotional experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability to harness positive emotions is of particular importance in populations involving disrupted positive emotion functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, participants engaged in a relived memory task in which they recalled either a controllable or uncontrollable past positive emotional experience in counterbalanced order, while concurrent experiential and autonomic responses were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants included adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853193" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">bipolar I disorder</z:e> (BD; n = 32), major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e>; n = 32), and or nonpsychiatric controls (CTLs; n = 31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants, reliving a controllable positive emotion experience was associated with exhibited increased respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, an autonomic marker of regulatory control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDD</z:e> group reported increased positive emotion and decreased cardiovascular arousal when reliving an event involving uncontrollable positive emotion, compared to the BD and CTL groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other group differences emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that although controllable positive emotion experiences may be adaptive for most, individuals with a history of restricted affect and depressed mood may actually derive more pleasure from times of unharnessed happiness </plain></SENT>
