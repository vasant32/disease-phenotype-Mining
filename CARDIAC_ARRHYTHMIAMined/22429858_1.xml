<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">Methadone</z:chebi>-drug interactions (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi>) have been shown to cause many adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, such effects have not been scrutinized in the ethnic Chinese community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed in two major hospitals in southern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 178 non-HIV patients aged ≥ 20 years who had participated in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">Methadone</z:chebi> Maintenance Treatment Program (MMTP) ≥ 1 month were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDI</z:chebi> is defined as concurrent use of drug(s) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> that may result in an increase or decrease of effectiveness and/or adverse effect of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi>, credible data sources, including the National Health Insurance (NHI) database, face-to-face interviews, medical records, and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> computer databases, were linked for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi> and co-medications were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 128 (72%) MMTP patients took at least one medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi> included withdrawal symptoms, which were found among MMTP patients co-administered with buprenorphine or tramadol; severe QTc prolongation effect, which might be associated with use of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> or droperidol; and additive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, which could result from use of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="3647">chlorpromazine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9566">thioridazine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Past <z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> use, co-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C, and a longer retention in the MMTP were associated with increased odds of co-medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among patients with co-medication use, significant correlates of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi> included the male gender and length of co-medication in the MMTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate clinical evidence of significant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi> among MMTP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should check the past medical history of MMTP clients carefully before prescribing medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because combinations of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="6807">methadone</z:chebi> with other psychotropic or opioid medications can affect treatment outcomes or precipitate withdrawal symptoms, clinicians should be cautious when prescribing these medications to MMTP patients and monitor the therapeutic effects and adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although it is difficult to interconnect medical data from different sources for the sake of privacy protection, the incumbent agency should develop pharmacovigilant measures to prevent the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53218">MDIs</z:chebi> from occurring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Physicians are also advised to check more carefully on the medication history of their MMTP patients </plain></SENT>
