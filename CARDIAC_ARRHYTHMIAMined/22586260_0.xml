<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that inferior vena cava-inferior atrial ganglionated plexus nerve activity (IVC-IAGPNA) is responsible for ventricular rate (VR) control during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in ambulatory dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We recorded bilateral cervical vagal nerve activity (VNA) and IVC-IAGPNA during baseline sinus rhythm and during pacing-induced sustained AF in 6 ambulatory dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Integrated nerve activities and average VR were measured every 10 seconds over 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left VNA was associated with VR reduction during AF in 5 dogs (from 211 bpm [95% CI, 186-233] to 178 bpm [95% CI, 145-210]; P&lt;0.001) and right VNA in 1 dog (from 208 bpm [95% CI, 197-223] to 181 bpm [95% CI, 163-200]; P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were good correlations between IVC-IAGPNA and left VNA in the former 5 dogs and between IVC-IAGPNA and right VNA in the last dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IVC-IAGPNA was associated with VR reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right VNA was associated with baseline sinus rate reduction from 105 bpm (95% CI, 95-116) to 77 bpm (95% CI, 64-91; P&lt;0.01) in 4 dogs, whereas left VNA was associated with sinus rate reduction from 111 bpm (95% CI, 90-1250) to 81 bpm (95% CI, 67-103; P&lt;0.01) in 2 dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IVC-IAGPNA is invariably associated with VR reduction during AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, right or left VNA was associated with VR reduction only when it coactivates with the IVC-IAGPNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vagal nerve that controls VR during AF may be different from that which controls sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
