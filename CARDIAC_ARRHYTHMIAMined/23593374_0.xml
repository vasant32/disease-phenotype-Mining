<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if early aversive experiences could interfere with emotion recognition, facial mimicry, and with the autonomic regulation of social behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a facial emotion recognition task in a group of "street-boys" and in an age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recorded facial electromyography (EMG), a marker of facial mimicry, and respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), an index of the recruitment of autonomic system promoting social behaviors and predisposition, in response to the observation of facial expressions of emotions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results showed an over-attribution of anger, and reduced EMG responses during the observation of both positive and negative expressions only among street-boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Street-boys also showed lower RSA after observation of facial expressions and ineffective RSA suppression during presentation of non-threatening expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that early aversive experiences alter not only emotion recognition but also facial mimicry of emotions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These deficits affect the autonomic regulation of social behaviors inducing lower social predisposition after the visualization of facial expressions and an ineffective recruitment of defensive behavior in response to non-threatening expressions </plain></SENT>
