<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether an early rehabilitation program was safe and feasible for patients during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (COPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this phase 1 randomized controlled trial, patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation of COPD admitted to the hospital were randomly allocated to a low-intensity exercise group, a moderate- to high-intensity exercise group, or a control group, who received routine physical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to routine physical therapy, patients in the exercise group had to participate in an exercise program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The program consisted of twice-daily aerobic and resistance exercise sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were the number and classification of adverse events and program adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 174 exercise sessions, there was 1 serious adverse event of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in the low-intensity exercise group that resolved within 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 12 other minor adverse events involving 5 patients with no significant differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients completed an average of 80% of their scheduled sessions with no significant between-group differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exercise groups improved significantly in walking distance; however, no significant between-group differences were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was preliminary evidence that it was safe and feasible to implement an exercise program for patients during an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation of COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to accurately evaluate program effectiveness </plain></SENT>
