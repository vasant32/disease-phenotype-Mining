<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ageing population in developed and developing countries will lead to an increase in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> in society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detecting people who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and ensuring optimal prevention management is essential for reducing the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> is inadequate in primary and secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>New <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> that have fewer side effects and population screening tools are available </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since resources for spending in health are limited, it is essential that formal economic analyses are undertaken to ensure there are informed and evidence-based decisions on where to best invest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention resources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is essential that renewed efforts in the area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention are undertaken within the public health research community </plain></SENT>
