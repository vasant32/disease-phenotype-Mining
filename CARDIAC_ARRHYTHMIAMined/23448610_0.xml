<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since heart rate dynamics have prognostic significance for the progression of a disease and for mortality, the main objective was to explore its value in disclosing risk for serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of 100 ARVC/D patients, 35 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ECG Holter recordings (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>&lt;100) and no medical treatment (either antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic drugs) were analyzed according to severity of ARVC/D (Group 1/mild, n=23 and Group 2/overt, n=12) and regarding positive late potentials (noise interval between 0.1-0.3 Î¼V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity of ARVC/D is defined: group 1 with no clinical recognizable signs and group 2 with clinical readily recognizable signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 3 (control) consisted of 35 randomly assigned healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences between the 3 groups were assessed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni`s post hoc multiple-range tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NLD methods, as opposed to linear time and frequency, show very significant differences between investigated groups vs. control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NLD methods by mean of the standard deviations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> NN intervals of sinus beats for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5-minute segments (SDNN index) showed prevalence of parasympathetic activity as opposed to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was even more obvious through interpolation of data as % of deviation of Mean NN interval in function % frequency (p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NLD methods describe complex rhythm fluctuations in ARVC/D patients that put insight at proarrhythmic potential of affected subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in combination with late potentials they improve recognizing hidden risks for serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
