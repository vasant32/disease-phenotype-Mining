<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted at 9 university-affiliated hospitals that comprise the clinical centers of the North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 315 patients admitted to NACTN clinical centers between June 25, 2005, and November 2, 2010, who had American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale grades of A-D and were 18 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were managed according to a standardized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population was 79% male with a median age of 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The leading causes of injury were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> (37%) and motor vehicle accidents (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of initial ASIA grades were A (40%), B (16%), C (15%), and D (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight percent of patients sustained 1 or more severe, moderate, or mild complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications were associated with more severe ASIA grade: 84% of patients with Grade A and 25% of patients with Grade D had at least 1 complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of complications occurred within 14 days of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent types of severe and moderate complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, cardiac dysrhythmia, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 3.5% and was associated with increased age and preexisting morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the type, frequency, time of occurrence, and severity of specific complications that occur after spinal cord injury can aid in their early detection, treatment, and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data are of importance in evaluating and selecting therapy for clinical trials </plain></SENT>
