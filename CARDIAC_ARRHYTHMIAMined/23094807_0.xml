<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 279 patients with paroxysmal (n = 163) or persistent (n = 116) AF, who were followed up for 1 year after the first catheter ablation for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were provided with episodic ECG recorder for 1 year and instructed to send at least 2 random ECG recordings per day and whenever they sensed symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also provided with external loop recorder for 2-3 weeks at 6 and 12 months to enable more continuous ECG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of 39 Â± 12 (12-60) month follow-up, 143 (88%) patients with paroxysmal AF, and 105 (91%) patients with persistent AF, respectively, remained in stable sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of episodic recorder expressed as a ratio of patients with identified AF/atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AT) out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a documented episode of AF/AT was superior to the efficacy of loop recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No AF/AT episode was recorded with the loop recorder that was not also documented by the episodic recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with the AF/AT recurrence detected by the episodic recorder, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was also revealed by the loop recorder in 70% of the patients after paroxysmal AF ablation (p &lt; 0.001), and in 52% of the patients after persistent AF ablation (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic AF/AT was present in 42 (26%) of patients with paroxysmal AF, and in 28 (24%) patients with persistent AF (p = 0.810) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From conventional follow-up unexpected and clinically significant episode of AF/AT that required change in therapy was detected in 9 (5.5%) patients after ablation for paroxysmal AF, and in 4 (3.4%) patients after ablation for persistent FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More episodes of AF/AT after ablation were detected by 1-year daily ECG monitoring using episodic recorder as compared to periodic ECG monitoring with loop recorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Identification of clinically significant episodes of AF/AT unrecognized from conventional follow-up was low </plain></SENT>
