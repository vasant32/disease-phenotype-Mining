<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The multielectrode array (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) enables noncontact mapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>; our experience is reviewed and reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> has a role as first line therapy in multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective and prospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive cases performed using the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> over a 6 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation, 46% under general anaesthesia, using radiofrequency (RF), cryothermal and low energy direct current (DC) was performed in 66 procedures on 31 females and 29 males, average age 50.2 yrs (19.3-81.6); 8 patients underwent multiple procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>24 patients (36%) had undergone past ablation for the same <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A wide variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chambers were treated, majority right atrial (56%) and right ventricular (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural success was complete in 77.4% and partial/indeterminate in 11.3%, highest in right atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (79, 82 and 100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RF energy was most commonly used (67%) and DC carried 100% success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ablation was delivered at 'early activation' and 'breakout' in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In re-entrant circuits linear ablation transecting path of activation extending to regions of functional/anatomic block was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of 7 complications were attributed to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>: groin haematomas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At mean 12.4 mo follow up 56% were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> free, 15% asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and 12 patients had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> is effective, safe and suitable for first line therapy in multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> particularly in the right heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further study is warranted comparing it to other mapping techniques </plain></SENT>
