<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the identity and function of these GABAergic inhibitory neurons and what determines their activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have identified a population of GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla that receive increased excitatory post-synaptic potentials during inspiration, but also have spontaneous firing in the absence of synaptic input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Gad1 (GAD67) gene promoter, we determined that this population of GABAergic neurons is in close apposition to cardioinhibitory parasympathetic cardiac neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (NA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neurons fire in synchronization with inspiratory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs during inspiration, this excitatory neurotransmission was not altered by blocking nicotinic receptors, and many of these GABAergic neurons continue to fire after synaptic blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous firing in these GABAergic neurons was not altered by the voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35456">cadmium chloride</z:chebi> that blocks both neurotransmission to these neurons and voltage-gated Ca(2+) currents, but spontaneous firing was diminished by riluzole, demonstrating a role of persistent <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels in the spontaneous firing in these cardiorespiratory GABAergic neurons that possess a pacemaker phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spontaneously firing GABAergic neurons identified in this study that increase their activity during inspiration would support respiratory rhythm generation if they acted primarily to inhibit post-inspiratory neurons and thereby release inspiration neurons to increase their activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This population of inspiratory-modulated GABAergic neurons could also play a role in inhibiting neurons that are most active during expiration and provide a framework for respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> as there is an increase in heart rate during inspiration that occurs via inhibition of premotor parasympathetic cardioinhibitory neurons in the NA during inspiration </plain></SENT>
