<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Percutaneous epicardial access and mapping/ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> are being increasingly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> are relatively common, other unusual complications may occur due to the complex anatomic architecture of the heart and surrounding tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we report a series of rare and unusual complications related to percutaneous epicardial procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2011, 334 patients underwent attempts at percutaneous, subxiphoid access for epicardial mapping/ablation at 5 experienced centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven selected complications are highlighted in this case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 had a 1-cm right ventricular pseudoaneurysm after several unsuccessful attempts at epicardial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was successfully managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had intra-abdominal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> related to puncture of the left lobe of the liver during access that required surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 had a subcapsular hepatic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> that was probably related to percutaneous access and was successfully managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient 4 had severe pericardial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, immediately after obtaining percutaneous epicardial access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A lacerated middle cardiac vein was repaired surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the patient ultimately died of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patient 5 had a history of cardiothoracic surgery and developed a right ventricle-abdominal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> after multiple attempts at percutaneous access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was surgically repaired without major sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patient 6 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac tamponade</z:e> caused by a lacerated coronary sinus branch during epicardial catheter ablation and required surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patient 7 had severe left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary vasospasm</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> during catheter manipulation in the pericardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This complication was successfully managed with intracoronary nitrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Though generally safe, percutaneous epicardial access and mapping/ablation can result in uncommon complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Awareness of these rare complications may facilitate early detection and successful management </plain></SENT>
