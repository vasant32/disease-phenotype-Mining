<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mimetic of the carboxyl terminal (CT) of Cx43, incorporating a postsynaptic density-95/disks-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding domain, reduces Cx43/ZO-1 interaction and GJ size remodeling in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we determined: (1) whether the Cx43-CT mimetic αCT1 altered GJ remodeling following left ventricular (LV) injury in vivo; (2) whether αCT1 affected arrhythmic propensity; and (3) the mechanism of αCT1 effects on arrhythmogenicity and GJ remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A cryoinjury model generating a reproducible wound and injury border zone (IBZ) in the LV was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adherent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> patches formulated to locally release αCT1 (&lt; 48 hours) were placed on cryoinjuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to controls, Cx43/ZO-1 colocalization in the IBZ was reduced by αCT1 by 24 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Programmed electric stimulation ex vivo and optical mapping of voltage transients indicated that <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-treated hearts showed reduced inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and increased ventricular depolarization rates 7 to 9 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours and 1 week after injury, αCT1-treated hearts maintained Cx43 in intercalated disks (IDs) in the IBZ, whereas by 1 week after injury, controls demonstrated Cx43 remodeling from IDs to lateralized distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over a postinjury time course of 1 week, αCT1-treated IBZs showed increased Cx43 phosphorylation at serine368 (Cx43-pS368) relative to control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In biochemical assays, αCT1 promoted phosphorylation of serine368 by protein kinase (PK)C-ε in a dose-dependent manner that was modulated by, but did not require ZO-1 PDZ2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: αCT1 increases Cx43-pS368 in vitro in a PKC-ε-dependent manner and in the IBZ in vivo acutely following ventricular injury. αCT1-mediated increase in Cx43-pS368 phosphorylation may contribute to reductions in inducible-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> following injury </plain></SENT>
