<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is limited research in Iran about these patients, particularly in relation to gender differences in the demographic/socio-economic and lifestyle factors, as well as disease parameters.Materials and methodsThe sample consisted of 347 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> patients in the age group of 18-64 years, including 181 women, assessed by an analytical cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were recruited from the two major heart hospitals in Tehran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected using questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 33.24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women were more often married and more often had offspring than men (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Educational level and annual income were similar between women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unemployment was higher among women (p &lt; 0.001), but financial strain was higher among men (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking, alcohol, and water-pipe use was higher among men than among women (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiac factors, for example number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath>, were similar among women and men, except that there were more hospitalisations owing to cardiac problems, for example <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease was diagnosed mostly at the hospital (57.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most medical care was provided by cardiologists (65.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 50.1% of patients had knowledge about their type of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defect</z:mpath>.ConclusionGender differences exist in the socio-economic and lifestyle characteristics of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, in some cases related to the disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings also point to the need for interventions to increase patients' knowledge about, and use of, healthier lifestyle behaviours, irrespective of gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, providing appropriate jobs, vocational training, and career counselling may help patients to be more productive </plain></SENT>
