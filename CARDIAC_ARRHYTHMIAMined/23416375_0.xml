<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Symptomatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) frequently originate in the right ventricular outflow tract, less frequently in the left ventricular outflow tract, aortic root, or mitral annulus (MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the patient population presenting with MA <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> arising from the MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 404 consecutive patients who presented for catheter ablation of idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>/VT over a period of 9 years, patients who were found to have an ablation site at the MA were analyzed for clinical and electrophysiological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two (5%) patients (mean age 45Â±18 years; range 16-76 years; 14 [64%] men) had <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>/VT arising from the MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>History of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> ranged from 2 days in a case with suspected focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001856'>myocarditis</z:mp> to 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient had severely depressed left ventricular function or significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, which was determined by echocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or coronary angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sites of origin were distributed around the MA with no preferential area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ablation was successful in 13 of 16 (81%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One 28-year-old female patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> magnetic resonance imaging and no structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> died suddenly 3 months after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> from the MA represent a rare subgroup of idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>/VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They appear to occur at any age and do not indicate underlying structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Catheter ablation has a success rate comparable to that of outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prognosis remains unclear </plain></SENT>
