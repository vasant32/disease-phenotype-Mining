<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>Palpitations</z:hpo> recurred not earlier than at age 23 years, and were attributed to narrow complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, which could be terminated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since electrocardiography showed a delta-wave, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> prescribed and radio-frequency catheter ablation of three accessory pathways carried out one week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after ablation, however, a relapse of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> occurred and was terminated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Re-entry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> occurred a second time six days after ablation, and as before, it was stopped only with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28462">ajmaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, it occurred a third time four months after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case shows that cardiac involvement in DMD may manifest also as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW-syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, repeated radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways may be necessary to completely block the re-entry mechanism </plain></SENT>
