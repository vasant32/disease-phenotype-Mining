<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Statistics on cause-specific mortality are important for prognostic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the national mortality registry in research on causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CONCOR registry of over 10,000 adults with CHD was used to verify the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> provided by the WHO guidelines based national mortality registry, by linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 7277 patients linked to the national mortality registry, 196 (2.4%) were recorded deceased, versus 228 deceased patients (3.1%) recorded in the CONCOR registry, during a follow-up of 25,900 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 48.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the CONCOR registry, 77% had a cardiovascular origin; nearly 50% were due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The national mortality registry recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in only 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this registry recorded <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with an 'unspecified' cause in approximately 30%, primarily containing patients who died due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> according to their medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WHO guidelines based national mortality registries lack the specificity and completeness needed for accurate research on causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in adult patients with CHD </plain></SENT>
