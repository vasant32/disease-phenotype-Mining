<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RCA) for <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>ventricular premature beats</z:mp> originating from left coronary sinus under the guidance of 3-dimensional mapping system (CARTO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) originating from left coronary sinus underwent CARTO-guided RCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anatomical structures were constructed and three-dimension (3D) electrical activation sequence was plotted for left ventricle and aortic sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distance of earliest activation point of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and origin of left coronary artery were surveyed after left coronary arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The electrocardiogram (ECG) results showed that R-wave was upward in leads II, III and avF, QRS waves in lead I was mainly of rS, rs and rsr types, QS type in lead avL, RS, Rs and rS type in lead V(1), RS type in lead V(3) and absence of S wave in lead V(5)/V(6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative mapping detected the earliest activation point on the posterior-inferior origin of left coronary artery (LMCA) ostium (n = 7), on the anterio-inferior of LMCA ostium (n = 3) and on the inferior of LMCA ostium (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The earliest activation point (local activation time) was shorter 86 - 120 ms than surface electrocardiogram QRS wave, discharge melting on the earliest activation point and nearby succeeded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> disappeared, <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> failed to be induced under similar preoperative conditions (aleudrin intravenous) and no complication occurred intraoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CARTO-guided RCA is a safe and effective in the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> originating from left coronary sinus </plain></SENT>
