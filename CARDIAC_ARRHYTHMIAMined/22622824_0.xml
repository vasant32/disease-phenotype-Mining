<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some investigators proposed that it might be a predisposing factor for arrhythmic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we aimed to investigate whether QTd differs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030319" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">panic disorder</z:e> from that in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 40 panic disorder patients and 40 healthy controls, Q(max), Q(min), and QTd values were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> rating scale and the panic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000756'>agoraphobia</z:hpo> scale were scored for both patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Q(max) and Q(min) values in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030319" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">panic disorder</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean corrected QTd was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; using left atrial size, age and heart rate as covariates) also corrected the significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, ANCOVA revealed a significant main effect for the diagnosis, indicating a significantly higher QTd for patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QTd might be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030319" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">panic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies in larger samples evaluating the effects of treatment are required </plain></SENT>
