<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that serum resistin levels increase in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether the increase of resistin is related to inflammatory or vascular endothelial function is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship of increased resistin levels to inflammatory factors and circulating biomarkers of vascular endothelial function in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and forty-four nondiabetic patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, insulin, resistin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> index (HOMA-IR) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups according to the median level of resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytokine levels and indicators of vascular endothelial function were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was used to determine factors influencing resistin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum resistin ranged from 2.57 ng/ml to 20.18 ng/ml in hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High resistin group (&gt; 8.36 ng/ml) had higher levels of TNF-α, IL-6, vWF and ET-1 but lower level of NO compared with low resistin group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Resistin was positively correlated with body mass index, systolic blood pressure, HOMA-IR, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, TNF-α and ET-1 but negatively correlated with NO (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR, TNF-α, NO and ET-1 are independent predictors of resistin with standardized regression coefficients of 0.625, 0.368, -0.260 and 0.222, respectively (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that higher resistin levels are associated with inflammatory activation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e>, because patients with essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> have increased TNF-α, IL-6, vWF and ET-1 and decreased NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the statistical association of resistin with TNF-α, NO and ET-1 suggests involvement of resistin in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> by influencing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and endothelial function </plain></SENT>
