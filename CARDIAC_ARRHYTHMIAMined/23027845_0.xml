<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to assess the validity and utility of T-wave integral measurement as an ECG discriminator of patients with ARVC and RVOT using a body surface mapping (BSM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A 120-channel BSM with quantitative signal analysis of the T-wave integral was performed in 10 patients with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with those obtained from 13 patients with RVOT and a control group of 12 healthy subjects (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age, body mass index, and QRS-axis on surface ECG were not significantly different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> patients showed a significantly negative T-wave integral in the right lower anterior region of the torso when compared with RVOT (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between RVOT patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a cut-off level of -0.3 mV ms, sensitivity and specificity were 83% [area under curve (AUC) 0.85 Â± 0.04 for the comparison of ARVC and RVOT] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were pronounced in ARVC patients with a plakophlin-2 mutation (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of the BSM T-wave integral in distinct anatomical regions discriminates ARVC patients from RVOT patients and controls and may serve as an additional diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
