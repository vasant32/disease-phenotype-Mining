<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: High-frequency jet ventilation is a novel technique for providing mechanical ventilation in the out of operating room (OOR) setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case reports and a small series of patients have shown it to be useful in patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> ablations, interventional radiology procedures, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, interest in the technique has grown tremendously as the ability to provide superior surgical conditions may lead to improved efficiency and less side-effects in a variety of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RECENT FINDINGS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation procedures, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumor</z:e> ablations, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the procedures that benefit from minimal movement of the heart, liver, and kidney, respectively, during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although randomized controlled trials are lacking, increasing data suggest that by maintaining the thoracic and abdominal structures relatively immobile throughout the respiratory cycle, the efficiency and safety of these procedures may be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Technological advances are allowing an increasing number of surgical procedures to be performed in the OOR setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such procedures often depend on the precise application of ablation catheters or shock waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High-frequency jet ventilation facilitates the improved accuracy of catheter and shock wave placement, as well as efficiency of a variety of procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved efficiency, with fewer side-effects, has tremendous implications for the growth of such procedures in the OOR setting </plain></SENT>
