<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypotheses that high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients would enhance vagal modulation and thus decrease arrhythmic events.Methods: Eighteen <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients underwent a baseline assessment (CON) and were then randomized to a single session of HIIE and to an isocaloric moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, and arrhythmic events by 24h Holter-ECG recordings after HIIE, MICE and CON sessions.Results: We found that HR was significantly decreased after HIIE (68±3 bpm, p&lt;0.01) when compared to CON and MICE values (respectively 71.1±2 and 69± 3 bpm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HIIE led to a significant increase in normalized HF power (35.95 ± 2.83% Vs 31.56 ± 1.93 and 24.61 ± 2.62% for CON and MICE respectively, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both exercise conditions were associated with an increase in VLF power comparatively to CON </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After HIIE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp>) were significantly decreased (531 ± 338 Vs 1007 ± 693 and 1671 ± 1604 for CON and MICE respectively, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association was found between the changes in <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVC</z:mp> and the changes in LF/HF ratio (r=0.66; p&lt;0.01) in patients exposed to HIIE.Conclusion: We demonstrate that a single session of HIIE improves autonomic profile of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients leading to significant reductions of HR and arrhythmic events in a 24h post-training period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardioprotective effects of HIEE in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> patients need to be confirmed in a larger study population and on a long-term basis </plain></SENT>
