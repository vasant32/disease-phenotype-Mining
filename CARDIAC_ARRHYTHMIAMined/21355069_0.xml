<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (VA), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, are the most common remediable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Augmented sympathetic neural activity to the heart and myocardial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release may be the primary factors in the generation of VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of salivary α-amylase (sAA) activity, an indicator of sympathetic activity, for malignant VA occurrence and for short-term outcome in patients with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> (n=91) were recruited from the Emergency Department during the period 1 December 2008 to 31 April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations of initial sAA activity at presentation with VA, as well as 1-month prognosis were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sAA activity was significantly increased in the VA group (395±173.7; n=9) as compared with the non-VA group (283±89.3; n=82) (p=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted OR for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> occurrence was 1.010 (95% CI 1.001 to 1.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (8.8%) died and 24 (26.4%) had at least one short-term adverse event within the first month after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simple logistic regression analysis showed that sAA is an independent predictor for short-term prognosis (p=0.049, OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.000 to 1.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although a prospective study with a large cohort is required, the present results suggest that high initial sAA activity is associated with increased risk of malignant VA and predicts short-term prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">STEMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
