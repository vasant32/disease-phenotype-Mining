<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Computer simulation is an important method for the basic researches of cardiac electrophysiology to prove the mechanisms and hypotheses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> by reproducing body surface electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this research, we extend the researches of heart models to the computer simulation of clinical electrophysiological study (EPS) as a clinical application of heart models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Through setting the standard EPS pacing protocols, including extrastimuli and incremental pacing in the heart models, we simulated the corresponding excitation propagations in the heart and the intracardiac electrograms that would be measured with catheter electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Examples of complicated cases observed during EPS are reproduced in this research, including the induction of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264907" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wenckebach</z:e> pattern, the induction and termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> due to the reentry loop of antidromic atrioventricular reentrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome</z:e> (Type A), and the localization of an accessory pathway for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="wpw">WPW syndrome</z:e> (Type A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an application of whole-heart modeling and computer simulation to clinical EPS </plain></SENT>
