<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In recent years, ablation therapy has become the first-line treatment of modern electrophysiology in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Today, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is an important supportive imaging technique in the implementation of complex electrophysiological investigations and ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In clinical routine, cMRI is used not only to generate accurate three-dimensional (3D) models of cavities of the heart but also for visualization of complex anatomical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The development of cMRI makes it possible to detect the underlying substrate of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> such as myocardial scar in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> or the structural remodeling of the left atrium in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The opportunity of fusion of the different imaging modalities (e.g., fluoroscopy, cMRI) has become essential for the planning and the implementation of a safe ablation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possibility of direct visualization of induced lesions using cMRI after and in the long term after ablation can predict the success of therapy and detects potential complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The continuous research in the field of cMRI and the development of MRI-compatible pacing and ablation catheters provided the basics for performing electrophysiological treatment in humans directly inside the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The implementation of ablation using exact visualization of the anatomical substrate, precise catheter navigation and real-time visualization of lesions in cMRI promises to improve success rates and the safety of complex ablation treatment and may revolutionize electrophysiology in the future </plain></SENT>
