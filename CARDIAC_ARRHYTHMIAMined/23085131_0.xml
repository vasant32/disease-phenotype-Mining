<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculated that small fluctuations in VT cycle length (CL) may be related to the efficacy of subsequent ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the R-R variations of the last 12 R-R intervals before ATP and the efficacy of the first ATP attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 551 VTs (CL 329±35 ms) occurring in 67 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the percentage of variation (P-RR), which was calculated by dividing the mean difference between each R-R interval and the next one by the CL (×100), and the acceleration index (AI), which was calculated by dividing the CL of the first 6 R-R intervals by the CL of the next 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The effectiveness of the first ATP therapy was 81%, being higher in VTs with AI&lt;1 (85% vs 64%; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After classifying the events according to the tertiles of P-RR, ATP efficiency was better in higher values of P-RR (VTs with AI&lt;1): 99% (third tertile) vs 85% (second tertile) vs 76% (first tertile), P&lt;.001; and for VTs with AI≥1: 94% vs 68% vs 42% (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By logistic regression, P-RR (%; odds ratio 2.37; P&lt;.001), and AI&lt;1 (odds ratio 4.17; P&lt;.001) were found to be independent predictors of successful first ATP attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Small changes in CL increase the effectiveness of ATP significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>VTs with lower degrees of R-R fluctuations, especially when the pattern is a progressive CL shortening, are infrequently terminated by ATP </plain></SENT>
