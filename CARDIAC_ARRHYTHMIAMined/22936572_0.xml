<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the management of a giant cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> initially diagnosed as an anterior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A nine-year-old female with right facial swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cough was diagnosed with a large right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240318" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mediastinal mass</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intermittent ventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> were noted on admission electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Empiric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and radiation therapy did not reduce the size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>, and initial tissue biopsies were non-diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to worsening tamponade <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, the patient was scheduled for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> debulking with potential resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to surgery, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to delineate team member responsibilities and treatment algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation preserved during endotracheal intubation and invasive line placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The team was prepared to provide extracorporeal mechanical support if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The child required inotropic and vasoactive medications after transitioning to positive pressure ventilation, but her hemodynamics improved with sternotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lesion was identified as a malignant cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1265994" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clear-cell tumour</z:e> that was unresectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Her sternum was left open, as attempted closure led to the re-creation of tamponade <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She underwent delayed sternal closure days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After months of chemotherapy that resulted in significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath>, she underwent successful surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Giant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary cardiac tumours</z:e> may present similarly to large anterior mediastinal masses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The care of patients with these lesions requires an understanding of the risks associated with mediastinal masses as well as those unique to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018809" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cardiac tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary approach is critical to providing safe and effective care throughout this process </plain></SENT>
