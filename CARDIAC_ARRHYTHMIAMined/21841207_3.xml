<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vernakalant, a relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic drug, has previously demonstrated efficacy for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> conversion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) to sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to determine the most appropriate oral dose of vernakalant for the prevention of AF recurrence postcardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with nonpermanent AF were randomized to 150, 300, or 500 mg vernakalant or placebo twice daily for up to 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy analysis was conducted on 605 of 735 patients who entered the maintenance phase on day 3 after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time to the first recurrence of symptomatic sustained AF was significantly longer in the 500 mg vernakalant group, with a median of &gt;90 days versus 29 days in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.735; P=0.0275) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant effect was seen at the lower doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percent of patients in sinus rhythm at day 90 was 41%, 39%, and 49% in the 150-mg (n=147), 300-mg (n=148), and 500-mg (n=150) vernakalant groups, respectively, compared with 36% in the placebo group (n=160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no vernakalant-related proarrhythmic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Related serious adverse events occurred in 2 patients in the 150-mg vernakalant group and in 1 patient in each of the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vernakalant, 500 mg twice daily, appears to be effective and safe for the prevention of AF recurrence after cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of proarrhythmia and favorable safety profile is an important finding for the drug </plain></SENT>
