<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ectothermic vertebrates experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> temperature changes which affect cardiac excitability and may threaten electrical stability of the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, ectothermic hearts function over wide range of temperatures without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, probably due to special molecular adaptations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine function and molecular basis of the slow delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> current (I(Ks)) in cardiac myocytes of a eurythermic fish (Carassius carassius L.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>I(Ks) is an important repolarizing current that prevents excessive prolongation of cardiac action potential, but it is extremely slowly activating when expressed in typical molecular composition of the endothermic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the I(Ks) of the crucian carp atrial myocytes with the currents produced by homomeric K(v)7.1 and heteromeric K(v)7.1/MinK channels in Chinese hamster ovary cells indicates that activation kinetics and pharmacological properties of the I(Ks) are similar to those of the homomeric K(v)7.1 channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently with electrophysiological properties and homomeric K(v)7.1 channel composition, atrial transcript expression of the MinK subunit is only 1.6-1.9% of the expression level of the K(v)7.1 subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since activation kinetics of the homomeric K(v)7.1 channels is much faster than activation of the heteromeric K(v)7.1/MinK channels, the homomeric K(v)7.1 composition of the crucian carp cardiac I(Ks) is thermally adaptive: the slow delayed rectifier channels can open despite low body temperatures and curtail the duration of cardiac action potential in ectothermic crucian carp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the homomeric K(v)7.1 channel assembly is an evolutionary thermal adaptation of ectothermic hearts and the heteromeric K(v)7.1/MinK channels evolved later to adapt I(Ks) to high body temperature of endotherms </plain></SENT>
