<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) on outcomes of catheter ablation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in terms of recurrence and quality of life (QoL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MS, a proinflammatory state with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, is presumed to be a close associate of AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study, 1,496 consecutive patients with AF undergoing first ablation (29% with paroxysmal AF, 26% with persistent AF, and 45% with long-standing persistent AF) were classified into those with MS (group 1; n = 485) and those without MS (group 2; n = 1,011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for recurrence and QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Health Survey was used to assess QoL at baseline and 12 month after ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 21 ± 7 months of follow-up, 189 patients in group 1 (39%) and 319 in group 2 (32%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When stratified by AF type, patients with nonparoxysmal AF in group 1 failed more frequently compared with those in group 2 (150 [46%] vs. 257 [35%], p = 0.002); no difference existed in the subgroup with paroxysmal AF (39 [25%] vs. 62 [22%], p = 0.295) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 1 patients had significantly lower baseline scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 Health Survey subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, both mental component summary (Δ5.7 ± 2.5, p &lt; 0.001) and physical component summary (Δ9.1 ± 3.7, p &lt; 0.001) scores improved in group 1, whereas only mental component summary scores (Δ4.6 ± 2.8, p = 0.036) were improved in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with nonparoxysmal AF, MS, sex, C-reactive protein ≥0.9 mg/dl, and white blood cell count were independent predictors of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Baseline inflammatory markers and the presence of MS predicted higher recurrence after single-catheter ablation only in patients with nonparoxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, significant improvements in QoL were observed in the post-ablation MS population </plain></SENT>
