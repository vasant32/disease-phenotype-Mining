<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Linear radiofrequency ablation at the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is the treatment of choice for typical flutter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate, reconduction through the CTI may occur in approximately 15% of patients and eventually lead to flutter recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that injection of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> may reveal transient CTI reconduction and predict early relapse of permanent CTI conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with CTI-dependent flutter (mean age 65 ± 11 years, 87% male, ejection fraction 55% ± 11%) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTI ablation was performed using an open-irrigated ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional conduction block was confirmed using conventional criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, transisthmus conduction was reevaluated after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a 30-minute waiting period, permanent recovery of CTI conduction was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 6 ± 3 months, clinical recurrences of typical flutter were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bidirectional isthmus block was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injection of 16 ± 3 mg <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> IV induced transient second- or third-degree <z:mp ids='MP_0010519'>AV block</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-induced brief sequence reversal at the right lateral wall occurred in 6 of 31 patients (19%) and revealed transient CTI reconduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among these 6 patients, 4 (67%) had permanent recovery of transisthmus conduction in the subsequent waiting period; the remaining 2 patients (33%) had clinical recurrence of common flutter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Importantly, no patient without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-mediated dormant transisthmus conduction (25/31 [81%]) showed permanent recovery during the waiting period or clinical flutter recurrence during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi>-induced "dormant transisthmus conduction" precedes early relapse of permanent CTI conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients without "dormant transisthmus conduction" develop no recovery of conduction during the postablation waiting period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Routine use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> for assessment of ablation lines may help to reduce the clinical recurrence of the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
