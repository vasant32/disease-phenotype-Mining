<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear as to whether RAFL is a result of PVI or a concealed phenomenon unmasked by the elimination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured low right atrial conduction times (LRACTs) before and after PVI and examined their relationship to the inducibility of RAFL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF but no history of RAFL were studied during the initial PVI procedure by radiofrequency ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued for at least five half-lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clockwise and counterclockwise LRACTs were measured before and after PVI by pacing the proximal coronary sinus or low-lateral RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Programmed atrial stimulation was performed post-PVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo>, if inducible, was confirmed by entrainment mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was induced in six patients (Group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or only AF was induced in the remaining 14 patients (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average change in the clockwise LRACT was 19.8±17.5 ms in Group A vs. 0.3±10.7 ms in Group B (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average change in the counterclockwise LRACT was 25.7±30.4 ms in Group A vs. 0.0±6.7 ms in Group B (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the groups in absolute LRACT or number of ablation lesions around the right pulmonary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> post-PVI is associated with prolongation of LRACTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ablation over the septal left atrium near the posterior right atrium during isolation of the right pulmonary veins may cause conduction delays that can lead to RAFL </plain></SENT>
