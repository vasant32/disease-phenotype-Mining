<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) technology and monitoring are evolving rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanisms of inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapies in a modern cohort of patients followed at our institution via remote monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 2009 to March 2011, a total of 2,050 ICD patients (19,600 patient-months) were remotely followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> events (shocks and antitachycardia pacing) were adjudicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 249 patients received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy (34% inappropriate therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks affected 33 (1.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 249 inappropriate episodes in 85 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>Supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) with 1:1 atrioventricular association was the predominant mechanism accounting for 133 episodes in 50 patients, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (97 episodes in 27 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-wave oversensing (16 episodes in five patients), electromagnetic interference (two episodes in two patients), and ectopic beats (one episode in one patient) accounted for a small proportion of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 35 arrhythmic episodes in five patients that could not be classified, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in patients with single-chamber devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in these results by device manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite many technological advances, inappropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks still occur but at very low rates and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> with 1:1 atrioventricular association represents their most common mechanism </plain></SENT>
