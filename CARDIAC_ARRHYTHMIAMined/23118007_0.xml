<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the utility of measures derived from standard 10 s 12-lead electrocardiogrphy (ECG) without complex signal processing in predicting appropriate therapy in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> population.METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 108 ICD patients for primary (n = 32) and secondary prevention (n = 76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical data and characteristics of QRS complex, T-wave, and heart rate from standard 12-lead ECG were examined and related to the occurrence of subsequent appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up of 29 ± 11 months, 44% of patients received appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with depressed heart rate variability (HRV) (≤6.5%) were 2.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-5.90, P = 0.015] times more likely to receive appropriate therapy than patients with HRV &gt;6.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>), large QRS dispersion of &gt;39 ms was associated with 2.88 times risk (95% CI 1.24-6.71, P = 0.014) of experiencing appropriate therapy than those with QRS dispersion &lt;39 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>, reduced maximum T-wave amplitude (&lt;0.4 mV) were 3.82 times (95% CI 1.63-8.93, P = 0.002) more likely to receive appropriate therapy compared with those with maximum T-wave amplitude &gt;0.4 mV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>History of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.30, 95% CI 1.29-4.12, P = 0.005] and secondary prevention (HR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.14-5.71, P = 0.022) were also predictive of device therapy.CONCLUSION: Measurements from standard 12-lead ECG were predictive of appropriate therapy in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incorporation of 12-lead ECG parameters such as these into risk stratification models may improve our ability to select patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
