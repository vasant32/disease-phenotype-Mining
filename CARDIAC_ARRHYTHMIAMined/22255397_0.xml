<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Differential diagnosis of symptomatic events in post-ablation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) patients (pts) is important; in particular, accurate, reliable detection of AF or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> (AFL) is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, existing remote monitoring devices usually require attached leads and are not suitable for prolonged monitoring; moreover, most do not provide sufficient information to assess atrial activity, since they generally monitor only 1-3 ECG leads and rely on RR interval variability for AF diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A new hand-held, wireless, symptom-activated event monitor (CardioBip; CB) does not require attached leads and hence can be conveniently used for extended periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CB provides data that enables remote reconstruction of full 12-lead ECG data including atrial signal information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that these CB features would enable accurate remote differential diagnosis of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in post-ablation AF pts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 21 pts who underwent catheter ablation for AF were instructed to make a CB transmission (TX) whenever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, lightheadedness, or similar symptoms occurred, and at multiple times daily when asymptomatic, during a 60 day post-ablation time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CB transmissions (TXs) were analyzed blindly by 2 expert readers, with differences adjudicated by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 7 pts had no symptomatic episodes during the monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14 of 21 pts had symptomatic events and made a total of 1699 TX, 164 of which were during symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TX quality was acceptable for rhythm diagnosis and atrial activity in 96% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>118 TX from 10 symptomatic pts showed AF (96 TX from 10 pts) or AFL (22 TX from 3 pts), and 46 TX from 9 pts showed frequent PACs or <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five pts made symptomatic TX during AF/AFL and also during PACs/<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of CB during symptomatic episodes enabled detection and differential diagnosis of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ability of CB to provide accurate reconstruction of 12 L ECGs including atrial activity, combined with its ease of use, makes it suitable for long-term surveillance for recurrent AF in post-ablation patients </plain></SENT>
