<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ivabradine in the treatment of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Due to its I(f) blocking properties, ivabradine can selectively attenuate the high discharge rate from sinus node cells, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=10) or ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (n=11) for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a washout period, patients crossed over for an additional 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent symptom evaluation and heart rate assessment at the start and finish of each phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After taking ivabradine, patients reported elimination of &gt;70% of symptoms (relative risk: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.34; p&lt;0.001), with 47% of them experiencing complete elimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These effects were associated with a significant reduction of heart rate at rest (from 88±11 beats/min to 76±11 beats/min, p=0.011), on standing (from 108±12 beats/min to 92±11 beats/min, p&lt;0.0001), during 24 h (from 88±5 beats/min to 77±9 beats/min, p=0.001), and during effort (from 176±17 beats/min to 158±16 beats/min, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ivabradine administration was also associated with a significant increase in exercise performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cardiovascular side effects were observed in any patients while taking ivabradine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, ivabradine significantly improved symptoms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> and completely eliminated them in approximately half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ivabradine may be an important agent for improving symptoms in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>inappropriate sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
