<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION:   Lipomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the interatrial cardiac septum is a benign disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In rare cases, the disorder can cause obstruction of atrial inflow, causing symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> resulting from the involvement of the atrial wall and atrioventricular conduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION:   We present a case of a Caucasian 66-year-old man with urothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> where transthoracic echocardiolography showed a mass in the basal part of the interatrial septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After injection of echo contrast, it was suggested that the structure was vascularized, thus implying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transoesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging gave the correct diagnosis of lipomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was then discovered that the patient had been referred to a computed tomography (CT) earlier, but no mention of the mass was found in the report from the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Re-evaluation of the images showed a clearly visible mass indicative of fatty tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   This case report highlights the importance of multi-modality imaging when the findings are not concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this case report also highlights the importance of careful examination of the heart on routine CT scans, something that is often overlooked by the radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case, the CT scan clearly indicated the diagnosis of lipomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the interatrial septum and thus could have prevented the subsequent imaging cascade </plain></SENT>
