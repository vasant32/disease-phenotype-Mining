<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease-specific mutations lead to prolonged action potential durations and early after-depolarizations in cardiomyocytes potentially giving rise to triggered extrabeats and life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic cells of patients and their differentiation into cardiomyocytes represents a powerful method enabling the investigation of disease-specific cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review we highlight the latest progress in the generation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo>-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and cardiomyocytes to investigate the disease in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also point out future challenges that need to be addressed to allow drug screening using patient-specific cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
