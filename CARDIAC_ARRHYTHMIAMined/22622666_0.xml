<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Magnetically guided irrigated ablation has been introduced for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on ablation of persistent AF is scarce, and first-generation <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="12" ids="49666">iridium</z:chebi> catheters were burdened by char formation at the catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, energy transmission of these catheters may be suboptimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Irrigated gold-tip catheters have been introduced to overcome these problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antral pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation (PVAI) was performed using a 5-mm irrigated gold-tip magnetic catheter (power setting, 48 °C maximum, 50 W, 15 s lesion duration; flow-rate, 30 mL/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The catheter tip was guided by a uniform magnetic field and a motor drive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left atrial maps were created using an impedance-based left atrial reconstruction and fused with a preprocedural CT or an intraprocedural rotational angiography-based scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients (42 male, 61.9 ± 8.8 years) underwent PVAI for symptomatic, drug-refractory persistent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PVAI was performed successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients confirmed by entrance block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procedure time (skin-to-skin) was 214 ± 47 min (104-354 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy time was 31 ± 21 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ablation time was 4,153���± 1,350 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No char or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation was found at the catheter tip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pericardial tamponade</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmias could be achieved in 57.9 % of the patients included in a follow-up of 11.6 ± 4.2 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was a trend to a better outcome in patients without previous attempts of AF ablation (n = 48; 60.4 % vs. 44.4 %, p = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remote magnetic navigation for PVAI seems to be safe and feasible using an irrigated gold-tip catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of this novel technique can be confirmed by mid-term outcome </plain></SENT>
