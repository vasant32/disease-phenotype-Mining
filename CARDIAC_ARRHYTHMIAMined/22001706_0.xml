<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) has been associated with increased vulnerability to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, both random (white) noise and (patho)physiologic processes (ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> and heart and respiration rates) may hamper TWA estimation and therefore lessen its clinical utility for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of random noise and certain (patho)physiologic processes on the estimation of TWA by using the fast Fourier transform method and to develop methods to overcome these potential sources of error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a combination of human electrocardiogram data and computer simulations to assess the effects of a <z:mp ids='MP_0009732'>premature ventricular contraction</z:mp> and random and colored noise on the accuracy of TWA estimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We quantitatively demonstrate that replacing a "bad" beat with an odd/even median beat is a more accurate approach than replacing it with the overall average or the overall median beat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that phase resetting may have a significant effect on alternans estimation and that estimation of alternans by using frequencies &gt;0.4922 cycles/beat in a 128-point fast Fourier transform provides the most accurate approach for estimating the alternans when phase resetting is likely to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, our data demonstrate that the number of indeterminate TWA tests due to high levels of noise can be reduced when the alternans voltage exceeds a new higher threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the amplitude of random noise has a significant effect on alternans estimation and the alternans voltage threshold should be adjusted for noise levels &gt;1.8 Î¼V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate that colored noise may lead to a false-positive or a false-negative result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose methods to estimate the effect of these (patho)physiologic processes on the alternans estimation in order to determine whether a TWA test is likely to be a true positive or a true negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study introduces novel methods to overcome potential sources of error in the estimation of TWA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These methods may improve the utility of TWA either for ambulatory monitoring or for clinical risk stratification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
