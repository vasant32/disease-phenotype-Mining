<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (AC) is considered a predominantly right ventricular (RV) desmosomal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, left-dominant forms due to desmosomal gene mutations, including PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T, have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a nondesmosomal phospholamban (PLN) mutation (c.40_42delAGA) has been identified, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To gain more insight into pathogenicity of the PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T by cosegregation analysis of the PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T vs the PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Dutch family (13 family members, median age 49 years, range 34-71 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> underwent (1) meticulous phenotypic characterization and (2) screening of 5 desmosomal genes (PKP2, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP) and PLN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six family members fulfilled 2010 AC Task Force Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven had signs of left ventricular (LV) involvement (inverted T waves in leads V4-V6, LV wall motion abnormalities and late enhancement, and reduced LV ejection fraction), including 6 family members with proven AC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T was found as a single variant in 3 family members, combined with the PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA in 3 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PLN mutation was found in 9 family members, including the 6 with AC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 with LV involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA was found as a single mutation in 6, combined with the PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T in 3 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A low-voltage electrocardiogram was seen in 4 of 9 PLN mutation-positive subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the family members with the single PKP2 variant showed any sign of RV or LV involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PLN mutation c.40_42delAGA cosegregates with AC and with electrocardiographic and structural <z:mp ids='MP_0003921'>LV abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this family, there was no evidence of disease-causing contribution of the PKP2 variant c.419C&gt;T </plain></SENT>
