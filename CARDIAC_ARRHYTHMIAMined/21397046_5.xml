<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Imaging cardiac excitation within ventricular myocardium is important in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and might help improve our understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to rigorously assess the imaging performance of a 3-dimensional (3D) cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique with the aid of 3D intracardiac mapping from up to 216 intramural sites during paced rhythm and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (NE)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in the rabbit heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Body surface potentials and intramural bipolar electrical recordings were simultaneously measured in a closed-chest condition in 13 healthy rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-site pacing and dual-site pacing were performed from ventricular walls and septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VTs and premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) were induced by intravenous NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography images were obtained to construct geometry models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The noninvasively imaged activation sequence correlated well with invasively measured counterpart, with a correlation coefficient of 0.72 ± 0.04, and a relative error of 0.30 ± 0.02 averaged over 520 paced beats as well as 73 NE-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and VT beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and VT beats initiated in the subendocardium by a nonreentrant mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The averaged distance from the imaged site of initial activation to the pacing site or site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> determined from intracardiac mapping was ∼5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For dual-site pacing, the double origins were identified when they were located at contralateral sides of ventricles or at the lateral wall and the apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 3DCEI can noninvasively delineate important features of focal or multifocal ventricular excitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It offers the potential to aid in localizing the origins and imaging activation sequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, and to provide noninvasive assessment of the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
