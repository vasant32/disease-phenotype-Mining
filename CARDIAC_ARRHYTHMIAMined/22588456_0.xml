<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, comorbidity, and pharmacotherapy in a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: An observational study including patients with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> identified from the Danish National Patient Register in the period 1997-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were matched on sex and age with five controls from the Danish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and the association with comorbidities and pharmacotherapy by conditional logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified 127 508 patients with a first-time diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> [median age 65 years (interquartile range 49-81), 52.6% female] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of the patients showed three peaks around 20, 60, and 80 years of age with the third peak occurring 5-7 years earlier in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35554">cardiovascular drug</z:chebi> therapy was present in 28 and 48% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found significant association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and the risk of admission for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> increasing with younger age; age 0-29 years [odds ratio (OR) = 5.8, confidence interval (CI): 5.2-6.4), age 30-49 (OR = 4.4, CI: 4.2-4.6), age 50-79 (OR = 2.9, CI: 2.8-3.0), and age above 80 (OR = 2.0, CI: 1.9-2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy associated with age and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized for first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> we found significant association between cardiovascular comorbidity and pharmacotherapy and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> displayed an age distribution with important gender-specific differences and higher incidence rates than previously reported </plain></SENT>
