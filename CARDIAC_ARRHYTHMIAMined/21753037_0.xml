<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> is a recognized complication of catheter ablation procedures, most commonly encountered during ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study aims to investigate the incidence, management, and hospital outcomes of cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> complicating catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients undergoing catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> at a tertiary referral center were included in this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 1152 consecutive catheter ablation procedures in 892 patients over 12 years, 11 procedures (1.0%) were complicated by ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergent pericardial drainage and surgical repair were required in 10 (91%) and 6 (55%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was apparent in patients with prior cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than half of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (6 of 11) occurred in the context of steam pops during radiofrequency ablation and were more likely to require surgical repair (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, left ventricular assist device, and biventricular assist device were used in 2 patients, 1 patient, and 1 patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 6 cases in which the site of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> could be determined at cardiac surgery, 5 were in the right ventricle (4 outflow tract, 1 free wall) and only 1 was located in the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and tamponade occurs in 1% of ventricular ablation procedures and in this series, occurred only in patients without a history of prior cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More than half the patients required surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> is often associated with steam pops and emergent surgical repair is often required when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurs after a steam pop </plain></SENT>
