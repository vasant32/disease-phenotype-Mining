<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), treatment rates of AF and the factors underlying awareness and treatment, in a large nationally representative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population sample of people aged 50+, living in the Republic of Ireland, were recruited as part of The Irish longitudinal study on ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten-minute electrocardiogram recordings were obtained (n = 4890), and analysed to detect AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Self-reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, subjective and objective health measures (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e>, CHA2DS2-VASc variables and blood pressure) and medications were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regressions were used to determine associations with outcomes of presence of AF, lack of awareness and untreated AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall prevalence of AF was 3% (95% CI: 2.4-3.7%), with a marked age gradient and sex difference [4.8% (men) vs. 1.4% (women); P &lt; 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 67.8% were at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (CHA2DS2-VASc â‰¥ 2), of whom 59.3% were inadequately treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high proportion of 38.1% were unaware of having AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CHA2DS2-VASc nor HAS-BLED score influenced awareness or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lack of awareness was associated with lower education (P = 0.01), lower cognition (P = 0.04), rural location (OR = 3.67; P = 0.02) and number of general practitioner visits (P = 0.01), whereas untreated AF was influenced by frailty status (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With projected doubling of numbers of persons over 80 in the next 30 years in the British Isles, detection and management of AF is pressing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of adults at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were inadequately treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More regular screening for AF, application of criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk and awareness of factors influencing diagnosis and treatment is recommended </plain></SENT>
