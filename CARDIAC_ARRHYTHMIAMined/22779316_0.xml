<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, it is rare in pilots and not compatible with aviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: We present two AF cases incidentally detected in two jet pilots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first case was a 39-yr-old male jet pilot with a lone AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since there was no structural abnormality or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the left atrial appendage on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), the patient was converted to sinus rhythm via direct current cardioversion (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pilot returned to flying duties after a follow-up period without any recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second case was a 23-yr-old male jet pilot who had suffered six attacks of paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversion to sinus rhythm was provided by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> at once and the second via pharmacological cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, spontaneous conversion to sinus was observed during two attacks of AF during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no abnormalities on physical examination, echocardiography, and laboratory tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the cardiac ablation procedure was applied, the patient couldn't be treated successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thereafter the pilot was treated with sotalol and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and was permanently disqualified from flying duties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> is among the frequent causes for aviators to be disqualified from flying duties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AF particularly should not be overlooked due to its potential for sudden incapacitation during flight via <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
