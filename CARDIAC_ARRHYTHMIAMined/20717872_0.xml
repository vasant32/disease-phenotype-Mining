<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oxymatrine is one of the main <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22315">alkaloid</z:chebi> components extracted from SOPHORA roots and has been shown to play various protective roles in the cardiovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to study the protective effect of oxymatrine on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and their ionic channel mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rat arrhythmic models were established by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> injection and coronary artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rat cardiomyocytes were acutely isolated, and the whole-cell patch clamp technique was employed to investigate the effects of oxymatrine on <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with oxymatrine markedly increased the dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> required to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, oxymatrine significantly delayed the initial time and shortened the duration time of rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by coronary artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac mortality rate in coronary artery ligation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was also effectively decreased by oxymatrine in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological study showed that oxymatrine could significantly inhibit <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium currents in isolated rat cardiomyocytes in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, oxymatrine plays a remarkably preventive role in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> through the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and calcium currents </plain></SENT>
