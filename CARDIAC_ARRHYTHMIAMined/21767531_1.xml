<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently zebrafish has become a powerful vertebrate model system for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> and another advantage is that the heart could be rapidly excised for in-vitro electrophysiological recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We made direct in-vitro recordings of adult zebrafish heart ECG using the microelectrode and tested the effects of various drugs on zebrafish heart ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The QT interval change in the ECG was verified by optically mapped action potential duration (APD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean in-vitro heart rate (HR) of the adult zebrafish was 118 ± 22 beats/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean QT interval was 312 ± 36 ms and mean HR corrected QT interval (QTc) 439 ± 39 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean optically mapped APD was 308 ± 30 ms, which was close to the QT interval in ECG (p=0.815) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35524">sympathomimetic</z:chebi> drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> increased HR, whereas L-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> decreased HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> channel blocker <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> and L-type calcium channel activator BayK8644 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner (515 ± 24 ms and 519 ± 27 ms, respectively, both p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The APD was also prolonged accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel (IKr and IKs) blockers E4031 and chromanol 293B, respectively, also <z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner (523 ± 25 ms and 529 ± 27 ms, respectively, both p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi>, E4031 and chromanol 293B also decreased HR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct in-vitro recording of adult zebrafish heart is an efficient platform for test of drugs which exert electrophysiological effects on cardiomyocytes, and perturbation of ionic channels that are responsible for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> also modulates QT interval in adult zebrafish heart </plain></SENT>
