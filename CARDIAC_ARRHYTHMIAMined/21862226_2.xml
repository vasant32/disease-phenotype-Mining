<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with FXS, males in particular, often exhibit extreme eye gaze avoidance and hyperarousal when they encounter stressful social situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> (OT), a hormone with prosocial and anxiolytic effects, could alleviate symptoms of social <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-dose trial was performed with intranasal administration of placebo, 24 IU OT and 48 IU OT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measures of eye gaze frequency, heart rate, respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA), heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> were obtained during a structured social challenge conducted 50 min following OT administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten low-functioning males with FXS (aged 13-28 years) traveled to Stanford for the initial visit: 8 completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eye gaze frequency improved significantly in response to the 24 IU OT dose and salivary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> levels decreased significantly in response to the 48 IU OT dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no effect of OT on heart rate, RSA or HRV although individual plots of the heart rate data suggested that OT <z:mp ids='MP_0002626'>increased heart rate</z:mp> in some participants and <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>decreased heart rate</z:mp> in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that intranasal administration of OT may ameliorate some symptoms of social <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in patients with FXS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further double-blind placebo-controlled studies of OT, conducted in combination with behavioral treatment programs, may be warranted </plain></SENT>
