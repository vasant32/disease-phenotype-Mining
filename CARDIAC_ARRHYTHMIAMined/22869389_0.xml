<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> has traditionally been used for reducing risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, over the past year, the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has become an accepted alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No study has conclusively investigated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risks of patients treated with dabigatran immediately following radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 156 consecutive patients referred for RFCA of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>: 31 patients were on dabigatran and 125 patients were on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications during the first 48 h and the first week following ablation were recorded and comparisons made using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major complications were defined as <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> requiring blood products or the need for vascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minor complications were defined as prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the catheter insertion site, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation, or development of <z:mp ids='MP_0009276'>ecchymosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study also took into account the intraprocedure activated clotting time (ACT) levels in an effort to describe any differences between both patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in age, gender, procedure type, or level of intraprocedural anticoagulation between the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and dabigatran groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications were observed in either patient group at either 48 h or 1 week postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of the 31 dabigatran patients and 21 of the 125 warfarin patients had minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications between the two groups (p = 0.7384), although rebleeding was more commonly observed in patients on dabigatran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In regard to the intraprocedure ACT levels, there was more variability in the dabigatran patient group, and it was more difficult to achieve the goal ACT level, yet these results did not affect overall <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our cohort, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-related complications 48 h and 1 week post-ablation were similar for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and dabigatran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran is associated with more intraprocedural variability in ACT than <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
