<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to characterize the electrophysiological effects of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> and to study the possible proarrhythmic potency of the drug in ventricular muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ion currents were recorded using voltage clamp technique in canine single ventricular cells and action potentials were obtained from canine ventricular preparations using microelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proarrhythmic potency of the drug was investigated in an anaesthetized rabbit proarrhythmia model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Action potentials were slightly lengthened in ventricular muscle but were shortened in Purkinje fibers by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> (20 µM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum upstroke velocity was decreased in both preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Larger repolarization prolongation was observed when repolarization reserve was impaired by previous BaCl(2) application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg) did not prolong while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> (25 µg/kg) significantly lengthened the QT(c) interval in anaesthetized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> following reduction of repolarization reserve by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> further prolonged QT(c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> alone did not induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>Torsades de Pointes</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (TdP) while TdP incidence following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> was 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi> significantly increased TdP incidence (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In single ventricular cells <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> (30 µM) decreased the amplitude of rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) delayed rectifier currents thereby attenuating repolarization reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) was slightly diminished, but the transient outward (I(to)) and inward rectifier (I(K1)) <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> currents were not influenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> at therapeutic concentrations and even at high dose does not prolong repolarization markedly and does not increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> treatment may lengthen repolarization and enhance proarrhythmic risk in hearts with reduced repolarization reserve </plain></SENT>
