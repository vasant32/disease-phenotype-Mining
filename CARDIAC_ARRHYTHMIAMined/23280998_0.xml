<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-insensitive rapid (AIR) cardiac T(1) mapping pulse sequence for quantification of diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-insensitive cardiac T(1) mapping pulse sequence was developed based on saturation recovery T(1) weighting, which is inherently insensitive to heart rate and rhythm, and two single-shot balanced steady-state free precession image acquisitions with centric k-space ordering, where T(1) calculation is inherently insensitive to T(2) effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its performance against conventional cardiac T(1) mapping based on inversion recovery (i.e., MOLLI) is compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phantom experiments (T(1) ranging from 535 to 2123 ms) were performed with heart rate and rhythm simulated at 60 and 120 beats per minute (bpm) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> using an external triggering device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten human subjects and 17 large animals were scanned precontrast and 5, 10, and 15 min after contrast agent administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the reference T(1) mapping, AIR yielded lower normalized root-mean-square error than MOLLI (8% vs. 3%, respectively, at 60 bpm, 28% vs. 3%, respectively, at 120 bpm, and 22% vs. 3%, respectively, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies showed that T(1) measurements made by MOLLI and AIR were strongly correlated (r = 0.99) but in poor agreement (mean difference = 161.8 ms, upper and lower 95% limits of agreements = 347.5 ms and -24.0 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our AIR pulse sequence may be clinically useful for assessment of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in patients </plain></SENT>
