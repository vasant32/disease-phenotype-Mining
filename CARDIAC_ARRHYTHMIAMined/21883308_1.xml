<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: After pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), patients need to be followed to analyze the effect of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the influence of the duration of Holter monitoring on the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrences after a single PVI at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) underwent successful PVI with phased radiofrequency and pulmonary vein ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed with electrocardiogram at 3, 6, and 12 months and 7-day Holter at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients received additional event recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 7-day Holters at 12 months were evaluated for documented left atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences, and each individual day with AF was categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 12 months after the procedure, 21 of the 96 (22%) patients had AF on their 7-day Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with AF recurrence, there was an increase in sensitivity from 53% of a 1-day Holter up to 88% with 4-day Holter, and 100% of a 7-day Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monitoring with duration of less than 4 days resulted in significantly less detection of patients with AF compared to 7-day Holter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A 4-day Holter at 12 months has an 88% sensitivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> detection, and appears to provide a sufficient monitoring time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prolonging the monitoring time to 7 days does not significantly increase the yield </plain></SENT>
