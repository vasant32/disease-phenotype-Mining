<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with the treatment of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038833" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior vena cava syndrome</z:e> and a coexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: This case report describes a bone marrow transplant patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host diseases</z:e> (GVHD) who was admitted to our intensive care unit with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002110'>bronchiectasis</z:hpo> complicated with nosocomial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When he was recovering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> after prolonged ventilatory support, he developed superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was delayed due to associated confounding clinical factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the rapid deterioration in patient's condition, immediate tissue diagnosis of mediastinal lymph nodes and re-canalization of vena cava by stenting were our priority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had many other medical problems such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, deranged coagulation profile, old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> which complicated the treatment plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>USG guided biopsy followed by stenting of the SVC was done after discussing the risks and benefits with patient's relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But, he had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from biopsy site due to deranged coagulation profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Again for the same reason, he was not given any <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours the stent was blocked by clot which was diagnosed by the deteriorating clinical features and repeat CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Then he was given enoxaparin in therapeutic dose and the clot cleared within a day possibly partly due to enoxaparin and partly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a bone marrow transplant patient with GVHD, the associated complications can confound the diagnosis of SVC syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Physician has to show high degree of suspicion as it may develop even if patient has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> due to other factors such <z:hpo ids='HP_0100721'>mediastinal lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SVC stent may clot even if the patient has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>So, it is advisable to defer the invasive diagnostic procedures such as mediastinal lymph node biopsy till the patient is well stabilized after the stent placement in SVC as it will prevent further use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Enoxaparin may be helpful in the treatment of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in such patients with multiple complications </plain></SENT>
