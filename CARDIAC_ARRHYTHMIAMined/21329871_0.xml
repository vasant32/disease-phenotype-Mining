<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations in conduction system <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> are occasionally found at electrophysiological study and may make this ablation procedure very challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the case of a 69-year-old man with a structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart and posterior displaced His bundle who underwent successful slow pathway ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of the characteristic slow pathway recording and His bundle electrogram is strongly recommended prior to radiofrequency energy application in the posterior septal region </plain></SENT>
