<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase experiments were conducted in exposed porcine hearts to demonstrate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization reaction</z:e>-induced myocardial electrical conduction block in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The porcine left atrial appendage was exposed under an open-chest procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, a water-soluble <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36303">chlorin</z:chebi> photosensitizer, NPe6, was injected into the pigs intravenously at 5 or 10  mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 15 or 30 minutes after the injection, a 663-nm continuous-wave diode laser was irradiated on the surface of the atrial appendage through a <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30563">silica</z:chebi> optical fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The laser energy was delivered to the tissue point by point at an energy density of 50-208 J/cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> tissue damages as a result of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization reaction</z:e> were determined by electrophysiology and histology, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in the myocardial conduction time between two electrodes was measured immediately after the completion of the 35-mm irradiation line between the electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conduction delay of 35.5 milliseconds might be due to the change in the conduction pathway induced by transmural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> conduction block with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization reaction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tissue temperature increase in the irradiated area was approximately 12.8°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Azan-staining revealed about 1-mm transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the atrial appendage at 2 weeks after the irradiation (50 J/cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization reaction</z:e> might induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myocardial electrical conduction block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiac ablation with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">photosensitization reaction</z:e> might be a non-temperature-mediated methodology for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
