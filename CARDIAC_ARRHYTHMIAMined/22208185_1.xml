<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac tissue is always surrounded by conducting fluid, both inÂ vivo (blood) and in experimental preparations (Tyrode's solution), which acts to increase conduction velocity (CV) close to the tissue-fluid interface, inducing transmural wavefront curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its potential importance, computer modeling studies focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanisms have previously not accounted for these bath-loading effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the increase in CV and concomitant change in transmural wavefront profiles upon both propagation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> dynamics within models of differing anatomical complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In simplified slab models, in absence of transmural fiber rotation, bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature dominates, significantly increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> complexity compared to no bath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of fiber rotation, bath-loading effects are less striking and depend upon propagation direction: the bath accentuates natural concave curvature caused by transmurally rotating fibers, but attenuates convex curvature, which negates overall impact upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that the high degree of anatomical complexity within whole ventricular models modulates bath-loading induced transmural wavefront curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, key is the increased surface CV that dramatically reduces both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> inducibility and resulting complexity by increasing wavelength and reducing the available excitable gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the importance of including bath-loading effects during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanism investigations, which could have implications for interpreting and comparing simulation results with experimental data where such effects are inherently present </plain></SENT>
