<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis testing of inappropriate fast, irregular, or asynchronous myocardial contraction provoking <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> has been the primary focus of numerous research efforts, especially during the last few decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapid ventricular rates resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), irregularity of heart rhythm-basic element of AF-and asynchrony, as a consequence of right ventricular pacing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011710'>bundle branch block</z:hpo>, or frequent premature ventricular complexes, have been established as primary causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main pathophysiological pathways involved have been clarified, including neurohumoral activation, energy stores <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, and abnormalities in stress and strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, from a clinical point of view, patients usually seek medical advice only when symptoms develop, while the causative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be present for months or years, resulting in myocardial remodelling, diastolic, and systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cases, making a definite diagnosis may become a strenuous exercise for the treating physician, as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may not be present and, additionally, therapy must be applied for the diagnosis to be confirmed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic process is also hardened due to the fact that strict diagnosing criteria are still a matter of discrepancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy options include pharmaceutical agents trials, catheter-based therapies and, in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ventricular pacing, resynchronization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the majority of patients, partial or complete recovery is expected, although they have to be followed up thoroughly due to the risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large, randomized controlled trials are more than necessary to optimize patients' stratification and therapeutic strategy choices </plain></SENT>
