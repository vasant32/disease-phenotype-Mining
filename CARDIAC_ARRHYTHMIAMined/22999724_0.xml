<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to characterize a variant in the SCN5A gene that encodes the alpha-subunit of the cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel, Nav1.5, which was identified in 1 large kindred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>) and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, including premature ventricular complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines for familial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> are based on conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapies, and no gene-based interventions have been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Family members underwent clinical evaluation and screening of the SCN5A and LMNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular electrophysiology and computational modeling were used to determine the functional consequences of the mutant Nav1.5 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An R222Q missense variant located in a Nav1.5 voltage-sensing domain was identified in affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp studies showed that R222Q Nav1.5 did not alter <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel current density, but did left shift steady-state parameters of activation and inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a voltage ramp protocol, normalized current responses of R222Q channels were of earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and greater magnitude than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Action potential modeling using Purkinje fiber and ventricular cell models suggested that rate-dependent ectopy of Purkinje fiber origin is the predominant ventricular effect of the R222Q variant and a potential cause of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In R222Q carriers, there were only modest responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> therapies, but <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> were substantially reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> or flecainide, which are drugs that have <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel-blocking properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The R222Q SCN5A variant has an activating effect on <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channel function and is associated with reversible ventricular ectopy and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the genetic basis of familial <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> can enable effective gene-targeted therapy to be implemented </plain></SENT>
