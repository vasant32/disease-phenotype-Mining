<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of triggered activity elicited in the isolated pulmonary vein from the guinea pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the termination of train stimulation (pacing cycle length of 100 ms), spontaneous activities accompanied with phase-4 depolarization were detected in 43 out of 45 pulmonary vein preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such triggered activities were not observed in the isolated left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of triggered activity was higher at a shorter pacing cycle length (100 - 200 ms), and the coupling interval was shorter at a shorter pacing cycle length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> (1 µM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> (0.1 µM), and pilsicainide (10 µM) suppressed the occurrence of triggered activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resting membrane potential of the pulmonary vein myocardium was more positive than that of the left atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="3385">Carbachol</z:chebi> (0.3 µM) hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and completely inhibited the occurrence of triggered activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the pulmonary veins have more arrhythmogenic features than the left atrium, possibly through lower resting membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of triggered activity elicited in the pulmonary vein myocardium were similar to those previously reported using ventricular tissues </plain></SENT>
