<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its incidence varies according to the implanted hardware </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim at evaluating the incidence of ANS and its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic effects among CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients who previously had an implanted CRT-P/D devices for ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-eligible devices, the initial screening was done by evaluating the programmer electrocardiogram (ECG) during device interrogation while pacing LV only from LV tip to RV ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those with ANS underwent screening by 12-lead ECG during biventricular pacing with VV interval programmed to 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with electrocardiographic evidence of ANS underwent detailed echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We screened 224 patients, 187 patients were excluded due to various causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven subjects were analysed for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anodal stimulation was found in 29 patients (78.4%) by primary screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (41.4%) showed electrocardiographic evidence of ANS by 12-lead ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ANS threshold was significantly higher than true bipolar LV threshold (4.5±1.7 vs. 1.1±0.3 V, respectively, P=&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten patients, with ECG evidence of ANS, underwent detailed echocardiography during biventricular pacing with and without ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were no significant differences in the haemodynamic, echocardiographic, or resynchronization effects with and without ANS, two patients showed significant reduction in LV function with ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anodal stimulation is a common phenomenon among CRT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In many cases ANS is seen with LV pacing only, while these changes may not be seen by ECG during biventricular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography did not show any significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> haemodynamic benefit during ANS, and some patients may even deteriorate </plain></SENT>
