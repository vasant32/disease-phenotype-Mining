<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of early polarization (ER) in a stable population and to evaluate the prognostic significance of the association or absence of Q waves or T-wave inversion (TWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study performed at the university-affiliated Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care Center from March 1, 1987, through December 31, 1999, we evaluated outpatient electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vital status and cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with a mean ± SD follow-up of 7.6±3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 29,281 patients, 87% were men and 13% were African American </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inferior or lateral ER was present in 664 patients (2.3%): in inferior leads in 185 (0.6%), in lateral leads in 479 (1.6%) , and in both inferior and lateral leads in 163 (0.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only when Q waves or TWI accompanied ER was there an increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (Cox proportional hazards regression model, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-7.2; P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Common patterns of ER without concomitant Q waves or TWI are not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; however, when either occurs with ER, there is a hazard ratio of 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm that ER is a benign entity; however, the presence of Q waves or TWI with ER is predictive of increased cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
