<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This paper presents a novel exploratory application of quantitative ion character activity relationships (QICAR) to estimate associations of human cardiovascular (CV) diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e>) with a set of metal ion properties commonly observed in ambient air pollutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>QICAR has previously been used to predict ecotoxicity of inorganic metal ions based on ion properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work was to examine potential associations of biological endpoints with a set of physical and chemical properties describing inorganic metal ions present in exposures using QICAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chemical and physical properties of seventeen metal ions were obtained from peer-reviewed publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with exposures to metal ions (measured as inference scores) were obtained from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Robust regressions were applied to estimate the associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> with ion properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was statistically significantly associated (Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 0.003) with many ion properties reflecting ion size, solubility, oxidation potential, and abilities to form covalent and ionic bonds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The properties are relevant for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which has been identified as a possible mechanism leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: QICAR has the potential to complement existing epidemiologic methods for estimating associations between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVDs</z:e> and air pollutant exposures by providing clues about the underlying mechanisms that may explain these associations </plain></SENT>
