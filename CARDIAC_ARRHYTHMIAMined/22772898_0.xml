<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relationships between TFA consumption and HRV remain understudied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We determined whether total TFA consumption, as well as trans-18:1 and trans-18:2 TFA consumption, was independently associated with HRV in 2 independent cohorts in the United States and Portugal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2 independent cohorts of older US adults (Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS], age 72±5 years, 1989/1995) and young Portuguese adults (Porto, age 19±2 years, 2008/2010), we assessed habitual TFA intake by food frequency questionnaires in CHS (separately estimating trans-18:1 and trans-18:2) and multiple 24-hour recalls in Porto (estimating total TFA only, which in a subset correlated with circulating trans-18:2 but not trans-18:1, suggesting that we captured the former) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HRV was assessed using 24-hour Holters in CHS (n=1076) and repeated short-term (5-minute) ECGs in Porto (n=160) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate-adjusted linear regression to relate TFA consumption to HRV cross-sectionally (CHS, Porto) and longitudinally (CHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In CHS, higher trans-18:2 consumption was associated with lower 24-hour SD of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals both cross-sectionally (-12%; 95% CI, -19% to -6%; P=0.001) and longitudinally (-15%; 95% CI, -25% to -4%; P= 0.009) and lower 24-hour SD of 5-minute average N-N intervals and mean of the 5-minute SD of N-N intervals calculated over 24 hours (P&lt;0.05 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher trans-18:1 consumption in CHS was associated with more favorable 24-hour HRV in particular time-domain indices (24-hour SD of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals, SD of 5-minute average N-N intervals, mean of the 5-minute SD of N-N intervals calculated over 24 hours; P&lt;0.05 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Porto, each higher SD TFA consumption was associated with 4% lower 5-minute 24-hour SD of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intervals (95% CI, -8% to -1%; P=0.04) and 7% lower 5-minute square root of the mean of the squares of successive N-N differences (95% CI, -13% to -1%; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Trans-18:2 consumption is associated with specific, less favorable indices of HRV in both older and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Trans-18:1 consumption is associated with more favorable HRV indices in older adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results support the need to investigate potential HRV-related mechanisms, whereby trans-18:2 may increase arrhythmic risk </plain></SENT>
