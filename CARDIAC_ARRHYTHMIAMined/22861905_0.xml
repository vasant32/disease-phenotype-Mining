<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, by bombarding inclusions with drifting spiral and scroll waves, we explore the forces exerted by inclusions onto an approaching spiral and derive the equations of motion governing spiral dynamics in the vicinity of inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that these forces nonmonotonically depend on distance and can lead to complex behavior: (a) anchoring to small but circumnavigating larger inclusions; (b) chirality-dependent anchoring </plain></SENT>
