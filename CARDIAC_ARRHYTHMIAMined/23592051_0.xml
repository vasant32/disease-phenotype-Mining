<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to assess whether this putative protection contributes to longevity, by studying MEFV mutation status in nonagenarians and the association of mutation carriage with life-threatening conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples and a medical history questionnaire were obtained from 200 nonagenarians (&gt;90 years of age), who received medical treatment at a large tertiary hospital in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MEFV mutations in the study group was compared to the known prevalence, by ethnic group, in the Israeli population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of associated diseases in mutation carriers versus noncarriers was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of study subjects were females (67.5 %) of Ashkenazi origin (78 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fifth carried an MEFV mutation, most commonly E148Q (73 % of total mutations), followed by V726A (5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the frequency of E148Q in Ashkenazi subjects was found to be higher than expected in the general Ashkenazi population (19.8 vs. 2.6 %, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> were more common in mutation carriers, while no difference was noted, between carriers and noncarriers, in the rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a wide range of other serious conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that E148Q carriage contributes to longevity in the Ashkenazi population, perhaps by enhancing <z:mp ids='MP_0002409'>resistance to infections</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
