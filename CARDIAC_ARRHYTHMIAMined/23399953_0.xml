<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Ablation techniques of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> in children have significantly progressed in the past decade; however, the number of pediatric ablations is still significantly lower than that in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, there is less information regarding the success rate and complications in this age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pediatric ablations conducted between March 2005 and February 2011 at Rajaie Heart Center were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abolishing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> source by the end of procedure was considered as success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrences before hospital discharge and those thereafter were named early recurrence and late recurrence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: A total of 125 catheter ablations were performed for 112 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of them 118 (94.4%) procedures were successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The success rate was significantly higher in the patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 105 patients who continued follow-up program, 7 (6.7%) cases experienced recurrence; the recurrence rate was inversely dependent on the patients' body size (P-value &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five cases were complicated during or early after the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the complications were cured completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therapeutic electrophysiology in children is an effective and relatively low-risk method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recurrence and complication rates are similar to those reported in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering our results and the previous reports, pediatric patients with serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> should not be deprived from ablation and should not be exposed to long-term toxic drugs </plain></SENT>
