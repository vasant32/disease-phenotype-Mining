<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 5-year retrospective cohort study was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> singleton, nonanomalous gestations delivered at 37 weeks or after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes of electronic fetal monitoring before delivery were interpreted by two formally trained research nurses, blind to clinical and outcome data, using American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) guidelines as well as deceleration features historically referred to as atypica such as shoulders, slow return, and variability within the deceleration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>Acidemia</z:hpo> was defined as umbilical cord arterial pH 7.10 or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incidence of atypical features was estimated; univariable and multivariable analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 5,388 women, the atypical feature seen with the most frequency was shoulders (n=2,914 [54.1%]) followed by slow return (n=2,618 [48.6%]), minimal deceleration variability (n=430 [8.0%]), and absent deceleration variability (n=4 [0.07%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of atypical features between neonates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> (n=57) and without (n=5,331) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between shoulders (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-1.81) or slow returns (adjusted OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.54-1.53) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, compared with patients with moderate variability within deceleration nadirs, neither minimal (adjusted OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43-1.55) nor marked (adjusted OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.27-1.55) variability was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support the absence of these specific atypical deceleration characteristics from the recognized definitions of decelerations stipulated by the College and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 2008 given their lack of association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidemia</z:hpo> or neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
