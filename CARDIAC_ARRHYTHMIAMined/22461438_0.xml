<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The restitution hypothesis suggests a function whose slope directly relates to APD alternans magnitude, predicting a critical instability condition, potentially generating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present experiments directly test for such correlations among <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, APD alternans and restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice haploinsufficient in the Scn5a, cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel gene (Scn5a(+/-)), previously used to replicate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1142166" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SUNDS">Brugada syndrome</z:e>, were used, owing to their established arrhythmic properties increased by flecainide and decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, particularly in right ventricular (RV) epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monophasic APs, obtained during pacing with progressively decrementing cycle lengths, were systematically compared at RV and left ventricular epicardial and endocardial recording sites in Langendorff-perfused Scn5a(+/-) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hearts before and following flecainide (10 μM) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi> (5 μM) application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of alternans was assessed using a novel algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scn5a(+/-) hearts showed greater frequencies of arrhythmic endpoints with increased incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo>, diminished by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, and earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onsets</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo>, particularly following flecainide challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These features correlated directly with increased refractory periods, specifically in the RV, and abnormal restitution and alternans properties in the RV epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter variables were related by a unique, continuous higher-order function, rather than a linear relationship with an unstable threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate a specific relationship between alternans and restitution, as well as confirming their capacity to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, but implicate mechanisms additional to the voltage feedback suggested in the restitution hypothesis </plain></SENT>
