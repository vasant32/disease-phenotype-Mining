<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of respiration on contact force (CF) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing CTI ablation alone (n = 15) and pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation alone (n = 12) under general anesthesia were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were delivered under ventilation (30 seconds) alternating with lesions delivered under <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> (30 seconds) at an adjacent anatomical site at CTI or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7772">antra</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average force (F(av)), force-time integral (FTI), and force variability were measured in a region-specific manner by using a novel CF-sensing ablation catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operators were blinded to CF data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: F(av) and FTI were higher with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> than with ventilation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CTI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> segments (P &lt;.05), an effect attributed to drop in CF with each respiratory swing, resulting in greater force variability during ventilation (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low FTI lesions (&lt;500 g) were strongly associated with longer ablation time to achieve bidirectional CTI block (r(2) = .81; P &lt;.001), left PVI (r(2) = .65; P = .009), and right PVI (r(2) = .41; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sites with transient CTI block were associated with lower F(av) and FTI than were sites with persistent CTI block (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sites of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> reconnection were associated with lower F(av) and FTI compared with non-reconnected sites (P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Catheter-tissue CF is critically influenced by respiration; greater CF is observed with ablation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Poor CF is implicated in longer ablation time to achieve CTI block or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reconnection </plain></SENT>
