<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiologic substrate is still unknown, and the pharmacologic responses have not been fully explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-sensitive atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients with repetitive uniform atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>, the response to intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (12 mg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg body weight), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (10 mg) were sequentially investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded at baseline and continuously monitored thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tracings were obtained at regularly timed intervals right after the administration of each drug to evaluate changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repetitive atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was abolished by intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in the 9 patients within the first 2 minutes after the end of injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> suppressed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> in 2 patients and shortened the runs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrial ectopic</z:e> activity in 1 patient, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was effective in 2 patients, 1 of them insensitive to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and the other 1 sensitive to this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was abolished by radiofrequency ablation at different sites of the right atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">Lidocaine</z:chebi>-sensitive atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> may eventually be also suppressed by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that this enigmatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> may be caused by different underlying electrophysiologic substrates and that at least in some cases, delayed afterdepolarizations seem to play a determining role </plain></SENT>
