<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is known that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> are effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in preventing AF recurrence following left atrial ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-five patients who had no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> indication undergoing catheter ablation due to drug-refractory paroxysmal (n = 90) or persistent (n = 35) AF were randomized in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to receive 80 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (n = 62) or placebo (n = 63) for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was freedom from symptomatic AF at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included freedom from any atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> recurrence irrespective of symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 months, 95% of patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group were free of symptomatic AF compared with 93.5% in the placebo group (P = .75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 85% of patients treated in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group remained free of any recurrent atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> vs 88% of patients in the placebo group (P = .37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean CRP levels decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group (mean change -0.75 ± 3, P = .02) and increased in the placebo group (mean change 2.1 ± 19.9, P = .48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean QoL score improved significantly in both groups (mean change 13.14 ± 18.2 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> group and 11.10 ± 17.7 in the placebo group, P = .53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with no standard indication for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 80 mg/day following AF ablation does not decrease the risk of AF recurrence in the first 3 months and should not be routinely administered to prevent periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
