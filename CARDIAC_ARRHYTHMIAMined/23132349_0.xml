<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation with the cryoballoon technique is an effective and safe method to treat patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal treatment strategy for patients with recurrences after this ablation is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this single centre study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a "redo" procedure using the cryoballoon in this patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary study objectives were to determine the rate of reconduction for individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> of the patients undergoing "redo" ablation and potential predictors of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2006 and September 2009, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with paroxysmal AF recurrences after cryoballoon ablation a "redo" ablation with the cryoballoon was offered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> conduction was determined and cryoapplications were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reconnected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Every 3 months, 7-day Holter ECG, symptom-driven transtelephonic ECG recordings, and questionnaires were collected for 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven patients underwent "redo" cryoballoon ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients, at least one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> with reconduction was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent conduction was documented in 63 % of the left superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, 56 % of the left inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, 43 % of the right superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>, and 56 % of the right inferior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 28 of the 47 patients (60 %), no AF recurrence was detectable during the 12-month follow-up (after 3 months blanking period) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rate of severe complications was low and not significantly different from that of the initial ablations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: "Redo" ablation using cryoballoon technology may be an effective and safe method to treat patients with recurrence of paroxysmal AF after cryoballoon PVI </plain></SENT>
