<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite many clinical studies, there is still no consensus on the most appropriate prevention strategy for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A randomized prospective trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of intravenous landiolol administration in the early period after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) followed by treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled in the study prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the treated group received landiolol intravenously (5 μg/kg/min) in the ICU immediately after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heart rate was maintained at 60-80 bpm and intravenous landiolol was continued at 0-10 μg/kg/min until oral drug administration was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> (2.5-5 mg/day) after extubation and this was continued postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the overall development of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurred in 4 (11.1%) of the 36 patients in the landiolol group, compared with 11 (32.3%) of the 34 patients in the control group, indicating that development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly inhibited by landiolol (P=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No major postoperative complications occurred in the landiolol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postoperative intravenous landiolol therapy followed by oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> may be more effective than oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi> alone for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> after off-pump CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also found that intravenous landiolol is well tolerated after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
