<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether isorhynchophylline protects hearts against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> is still incompletely investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was therefore aimed to examine the preventive effects of isorhynchophylline on heart <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in guinea pigs and rats and then explore their electrophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="26" ids="3312">calcium chloride</z:chebi> were used to establish experimental arrhythmic models in guinea pigs and rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, the whole-cell patch-lamp technique was used to study the effect of isorhynchophylline on action potential duration and calcium channels in acutely isolated guinea pig and rat cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> required to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> was much larger in guinea pigs administered with isorhynchophylline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="3312">calcium chloride</z:chebi> was prolonged, and the duration was shortened in rats pretreated with isorhynchophylline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The further study showed that isorhynchophylline could significantly decrease action potential duration and inhibit calcium currents in isolated guinea pig and rat cardiomyocytes in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, isorhynchophylline played a remarkably preventive role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> through the inhibition of calcium currents in rats and guinea pigs </plain></SENT>
