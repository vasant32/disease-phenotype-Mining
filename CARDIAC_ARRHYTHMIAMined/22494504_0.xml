<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The long-term effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) on blood pressure (BP) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e>) remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that restoration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm (NSR) results in a decrease in BP despite the expected increase in cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four-hour BP measurements were obtained during AF, and on Day 1 and Day 30 post-successful cardioversion in 18 patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> (cardioversion group), and another 22 patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> with no immediate plans for cardioversion (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for the duration of AF, the clinical characteristics and use of medications were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cardioversion group, a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and mean blood pressure (MBP) were noted on Day 1 post-cardioversion with no significant change in systolic blood pressure (SBP): 117/74/88 ± 13/9/9 mmHg during AF and 116/70/85 ± 13/9/10 mmHg during Day 1 post-cardioversion (P = 0.68; &lt;0.01 and 0.04 for SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, and MBP, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 13 subjects who remained in NSR at Day 30, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and MBP decreased further on Day 30 when compared to Day 1 with no significant change in SBP: 118/76/90 ± 13/7/8 mmHg during AF; 119/72/88 ± 12/8/9 mmHg during Day 1; and 118/69/86 ± 10/8/7 mmHg during Day 30 post-cardioversion (P = 0.97; &lt;0.001 and 0.03 for SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, and MBP, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the control group, no significant changes in BP were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Restoring NSR in patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> resulted in a sustained decrease in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi> and MBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that maintenance of NSR improves BP control in patients with AF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HTN</z:e> </plain></SENT>
