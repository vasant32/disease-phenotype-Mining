<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has been used for the ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the mapping and catheter ablation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> originating from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) has not been specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the electrocardiogram (ECG) feature of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> or VT originating from the LVOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the treatment outcome of RFCA is analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mapping and ablation were performed on the supravalvular or subvalvular aorta in 52 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the LVOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with those from 104 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A differential procedure was prepared based on the comparison of the ECG features of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the RVOT, LVOT, and their different parts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 52 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> originating from the LVOT, 47 were successfully treated by RFCA, with a success rate of 90.38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several differences among the 12-lead ECG features were observed from the RVOT and LVOT in the left and right coronary sinus groups, as well as under the left coronary sinus group (left fibrous trigone): (1) If the precordial leads transition &lt;V3 plus the precordial leads transitional index &gt;0 are considered as the diagnostic parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the LVOT, then the sensitivity, specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values are 94.12%, 93.00%, 87.27%, and 96.88%, respectively; (2) The analysis of different subgroups of the LVOT are as follows: (a) A mainly positive wave of r or m pattern was recorded in the lead I in 72.73% of patients in the right coronary sinus group, versus 12.90% of patients in the left coronary sinus group, and 0% in the under left coronary sinus group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(b) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the right coronary sinus group presented waves of RII&gt;RIII and QSaVR&gt;QSaVL, whereas most patients in the other two groups showed waves of RIII&gt;RII and QSaVL&gt;QSaVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(c) Most patients in the under left coronary sinus group in lead V1 had a mainly positive wave (R) (77.78%), whereas those in the right (81.82%) and left (62.50%) coronary sinus groups had mainly negative waves (rS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RFCA is a safe and effective curative therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>/VT originating from the LVOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 12-lead ECG features of the LVOT from different origins exhibit certain distinctions </plain></SENT>
