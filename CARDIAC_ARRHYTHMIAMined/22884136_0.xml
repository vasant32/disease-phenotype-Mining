<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to observe the clinical feasibility of arterial pressure-based cardiac output (APCO) for cardiac output (CO) monitoring and to evaluate the correlation between APCO and pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) for CO measurement for patients undergoing OPCABG intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) classification II-III, undergoing elective OPCABG at Beijing Anzhen Hospital were randomly enrolled into this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assigned to CO monitoring by PAC and APCO simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with pacemaker, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo>, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 40%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, application of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and emergent diversion to cardiac pulmonary bypass were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The radial artery waveform was analyzed to estimate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV) and heart rate (HR) continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CO was calculated as SV ' HR; other derived parameters were cardiac index (CI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume index (SVI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAC was placed via right internal jugular vein and the correct position was confirmed by PAC waveforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Continuous cardiac output (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="16236">CCO</z:chebi>), CI and other hemodynamic parameters were monitored at following 5 time points: immediate after anesthesia induction (baseline value), anastomosis of left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LAD), anastomosis of left circumflex (LCX), anastomosis of posterior descending artery (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) and immediate after sternal closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 50 patients, preoperative echocardiography measured left ventricular EF was (52.8 ± 11.5)%, and 35 patients (70%) showed regional wall motion abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation coefficient of CO monitored by APCO and PAC were 0.70, 0.59, 0.78, 0.74 and 0.85 at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The bias range of CI monitored from both APCO and PAC were (0.39 ± 0.06) L×min(-1)×m(-2), (0.48 ± 0.12) L×min(-1)×m(-2), (0.26 ± 0.06) L×min(-1)×m(-2), (0.27 ± 0.06) L×min(-1)×m(-2), (0.30 ± 0.05) L×min(-1)×m(-2) at each time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of SVR by two hemodynamic monitoring techniques had good correlation during OPCABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The variation trends of SVR were opposite comparing with the results of CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SVR collected from PAC obtained the highest value of (1220.0 ± 254.0) dyn×s×cm(-5) at <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> anastomosis, but the highest value obtained from APCO was (1206.0 ± 226.5) dyn×s×cm(-5) in LCX anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: APCO is feasible in hemodynamic monitoring for patients undergoing OPCABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results of hemodynamic monitoring derived from APCO and PAC are closely correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Its characterizations of timely, accurate and continuous display of hemodynamic parameters are also obviously demonstrated in the present study </plain></SENT>
