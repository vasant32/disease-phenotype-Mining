<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, both do not provide adequate temporal resolution to measure fetal cardiac time intervals and detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which can occur during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) is a non-invasive technique measuring magnetic signals generated by fetal heart activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most fMCG devices are installed in research institutions limiting the implementation of this method in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several institutions made a step forward by installing devices, in particular for fetal investigations, in hospital sites to evaluate the clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on instrumentation differences which can affect signal quality, there is still no established reference database for fetal cardiac time intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A new magnetograph dedicated to fetal recordings was implemented with improved patient comfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The setting was optimized to establish a standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 103 healthy fetuses starting as early as possible after the first trimester were recorded and fMCG values of cardiac time intervals were compared to former studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data allowed high and reliable detection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fMCG components starting at 17 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data were comparable to fMCG multicenter studies, fetal electrocardiography and neonatal ECG results and could serve as a database of norm values for further investigation of fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
