<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes an automatic classification system based on combination of diverse features for the purpose of automatic heartbeat recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method consists of three stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the first stage, heartbeats are classified into 5 main groups defined by AAMI using optimal feature sets for each main group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the second stage, main groups are classified into subgroups using optimal features for each subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the third stage is added to the system for classifying beats that are labeled as unclassified beats in the first two classification stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diverse set of features including higher order statistics, morphological features, Fourier transform coefficients, and higher order statistics of the wavelet package coefficients are extracted for each different type of ECG beat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the first stage, optimal features for main groups are determined by using a wrapper type feature selection algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the second stage, optimal features are similarly selected for discriminating each subgroup of the main groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then at the third stage, only raw data is used for classifying beats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages, the classifiers are based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ECG records used in this study are obtained from the <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The classification accuracy of the proposed system is measured by sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The system is classified 16 heartbeat types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The measures of proposed system are 85.59%, 95.46%, and 99.56%, for average sensitivity, average selectivity, and average specificity, respectively </plain></SENT>
