<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of left-sided atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> generally is performed using a transfemoral venous approach through the inferior vena cava (IVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we assessed the feasibility of a percutaneous transhepatic approach to ablation of left-sided atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in 2 patients with interruption of the IVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> in the setting of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> and prior Fontan for univentricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and a single atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous hepatic vein access was obtained with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transseptal catheterization was performed in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, the hepatic tract in patient 1 was cauterized using a bipolar radiofrequency catheter, and an Amplatzer vascular plug was used in patient 2 to obtain hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous hepatic vein access was achieved without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After electroanatomical mapping, a linear lesion was placed between the single atrioventricular valve and the confluence of the hepatic veins in patient 1; this terminated the flutter, and bidirectional block was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patient 2, the pulmonary veins were electrically isolated using an extraostial approach, isolating the ipsilateral veins in pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ablation of right-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> was achieved by obtaining bidirectional block across a linear lesion between the tricuspid valve and confluence of the hepatic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis of the transhepatic tract was attained in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with interrupted IVCs, a percutaneous transhepatic approach is a feasible alternative for performing catheter ablation of complex left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
