<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Building on the information gathered from earlier <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer and myocyte overexpression studies, the gene-targeted ablation of Trdn demonstrated triadin's indispensable role for maintaining the structural integrity of the couplon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, the discovery of inherited and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired diseases</z:e> displaying altered expression and function of triadin has further emphasized the role of triadin in health and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel therapeutic approaches could be aimed at correcting the loss of triadin in diseased hearts, and thereby correcting the sub-cellular EC coupling defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes current concepts of the impact of triadin on cardiac EC coupling with a focus towards triadin's role for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
