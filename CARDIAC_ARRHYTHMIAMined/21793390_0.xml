<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is of great significance in finding a method to reduce their toxicity and improve clinical curative effects simultaneously in the application of digitalis <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been well documented that acupuncture has good therapeutic effects in improving cardiac function and inhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acupuncture combined with chemotherapeutics can reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, acupuncture combined with digitalis is likely to reduce the side effects of digitalis by regulating intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>, improving the function of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing calcium sensitivity of cardiac troponin, etc </plain></SENT>
