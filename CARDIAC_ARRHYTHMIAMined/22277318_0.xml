<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Improved medical techniques have allowed most women with repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (TOF) to reach childbearing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predictors of adverse events and the effects of pregnancy on cardiac function have not been clearly described in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study we retrospectively reviewed 40 deliveries in 25 patients with repaired TOF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 23 patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, and 2 in classes II-III before pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at delivery was 29.1 years and the mean gestational period was 37.8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven pregnancies (17.5%) in 7 patients were complicated with cardiac events such as a decline in NYHA class and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>History of ablation and the baseline cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiography were predictors of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peak plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) level after the second trimester was higher in patients with cardiac events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular size and contraction did not change from before to after pregnancy, but the right ventricle was enlarged at 6 months after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many of the pregnancies in women with repaired TOF were successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, careful management is required for some patients and the BNP level may be a useful marker to identify these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the right heart tended to be enlarged in the late postpartum period, pregnancy may also affect the long-term prognosis of patients with repaired TOF </plain></SENT>
