<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) are associated with significant mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sometimes encounter patients who have AF upon admission to the hospital, but it spontaneously converts to sinus rhythm within several days (i.e. converter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We examined the association between the outcome and types of strategy for AF treatment in converters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2005, we identified 95 converters (age 69 ± 12 years) presenting with worsening HF and AF upon admission, in which sinus rhythm was restored within 7 days without either electrical or pharmacological cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into three groups according to the antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy used: class I AAD, class III AAD, and rate-control drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for 36 ± 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly improved with conversion to sinus rhythm (38 ± 14% vs. 47 ± 13%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those receiving class I AAD had a trend toward a well-preserved LVEF (50 ± 13%, n=35) as compared to those receiving class III AAD (43 ± 12%, n=24) or rate-control drug (47 ± 14%, n=36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patients receiving class I AAD, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increased 1.9-fold (p=0.009) compared to those receiving class III AAD, and 1.7-fold (p=0.010) compared to those taking rate-control drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A hospitalization for HF was observed in 49 (52%) patients, however there was no significant difference in the rate of hospitalization among the three groups (p=0.890) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those receiving rate-control drugs had a 50% lower rate of the development of persistent AF than those taking class III AAD (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A rate-control strategy should be the primary approach for converters to reduce mortality and development of persistent AF </plain></SENT>
