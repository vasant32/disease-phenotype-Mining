<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although several predictors of an electrical storm (ES) are indicated in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e>), whether the severity of the myocardial tissue damage (SMTD) evaluated by myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) has an association with an ES remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical significance of SMTD for the prediction of ES in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven (27 men, mean age 58 ± 15 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> patients receiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantations for secondary prevention with preoperative MPS were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical history, physical and laboratory findings, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms and MPS findings were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SMTD was assessed by the summed scores of 17 segments using a 4-point system (0, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ~3, severe defect) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 43.9 ± 30.7 months, an ES developed in 12/37 (32.4 %) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SMTD score predicted an ES with a 92 % sensitivity and 56 % specificity, at a cut-off score of 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a multivariate analysis showed that the SMTD score remained an independent predictor of an ES (HR 1.09/score 1 increase, 95 % CI 1.01-1.19, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SMTD score was significantly associated with three indices of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiograms, and was significantly higher in patients with positive late potentials (p = 0.0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SMTD score assessed by MPS has a strong correlation to the late potentials and higher SMTD score may increase the risk of ES among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264793" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDC">IDCM</z:e> and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
