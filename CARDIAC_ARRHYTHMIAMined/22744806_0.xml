<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCE: Spontaneous reports in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database generated between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reports of adverse events during the study period were reviewed to identify cardiac events associated with any approved drug in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The type and number of cardiac events associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Active ingredients were identified using the Drugs@FDA database, and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) was used to aggregate related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To avoid redundant reporting, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> statistics were generated in reference to unique case identifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> was associated with more adverse cardiovascular event reports than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (810 vs 493 reports) during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> was also associated with the most reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> of any approved drug in the United States (37 reports), followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (29 reports) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (138 vs 113 reports) as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (179 vs 126 reports) were more common with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">dronedarone</z:chebi> than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50659">Dronedarone</z:chebi> was associated with reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether this observation accounts for the increased risk of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> observed in a recent prospective trial requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
