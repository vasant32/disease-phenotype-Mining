<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was the interpretation of its vibrational spectra with consideration on the solvent effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infrared and Raman spectra were recorded in solid state as well in solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental spectra were evaluated using DFT quantum chemical calculations computing the optimized structure, atomic net charges, vibrational frequencies and force constants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same calculations were done for the molecule in DMSO and aqueous solutions applying the PCM method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculated force constants were scaled to the experimentally observed solid state frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characters of the vibrational modes were determined by their potential energy distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Solvent effects on the molecular properties were interpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results vibrational spectra were simulated </plain></SENT>
