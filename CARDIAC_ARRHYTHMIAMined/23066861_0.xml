<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-nine CSX subjects were retrospectively enrolled from our catheterization databank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 54 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adipokines were measured by ELISA tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CSX had lower circulating adiponectin but higher leptin and higher leptin/adiponectin ratio (×1000) (3.78 ± 4.96 vs. 2.14 ± 5.67, p &lt; 0.001) than those of the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, a higher leptin/adiponectin ratio was a predictor of CSX, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin-resistance</z:hpo> index was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines may be implicated in the pathogenesis of CSX </plain></SENT>
