<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study aimed to elucidate the clinical characteristics of massive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> occurring during <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 2976 patients undergoing AF ablation, 5 patients complicated by serious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> ablation was performed with the use of three long sheaths for circular mapping and ablation catheters under conscious sedation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had air spontaneously introduced through a haemostasis valve of the long sheaths, at the end of long <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo> caused by the sedation, even though the catheters were placed within the long sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom also exhibited long <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo>, had air entry at the circular mapping catheter exchanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Air accumulated in the right and left ventricles, left atrial appendage, right coronary artery, and ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic collapse and hypoxaemia occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> and two patients, respectively, and supportive treatment and the accumulated air were aspirated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ST elevation, haemodynamic collapse, and hypoxaemia persisted for 10-35 min; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After we changed the sedative to one with less respiratory depressive effects and the timing of the saline flush at the circular mapping catheter exchanges, we never experienced such serious complications any further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serious <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> can occur in patients with long <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo> under sedation during AF ablation with the use of long sheaths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supportive therapy and air <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> were effective in resolving the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A sedative that causes less respiratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and the timing of the saline flush were important for preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
