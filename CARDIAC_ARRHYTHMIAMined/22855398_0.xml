<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electroanatomical navigation can reduce exposure, but the cohort of children who derive the greatest benefit from this approach is incompletely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine factors associated with fluoroscopy exposure with conventional catheter ablation versus electroanatomical navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ablation procedures over a 5-year period during the transition to electroanatomical navigation performed by a single electrophysiologist was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluoroscopy time &gt;20 min was considered "prolonged." Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four subjects underwent catheter ablation during the study period (conventional, n = 127; navigation, n = 107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean fluoroscopy decreased from 11.1 to 3.5 min with electroanatomical navigation (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall 53/107 subjects (50 %) undergoing catheter ablation using electroanatomical navigation required no fluoroscopy, of which atrioventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (AVNRT) (n = 23) and right-sided accessory pathways (n = 22) were most common (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged fluoroscopic exposure was observed for 22/127 (17 %) subjects undergoing conventional fluoroscopy versus 3/107 (3 %) subjects with electroanatomical navigation (p = 0.001) and was not observed after increased experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flouroscopy time decreased significantly after the first 20 procedures (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in success, complication, or recurrence rate between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electroanatomical navigation significantly reduced fluoroscopic exposure without compromising safety, efficacy, or recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Subjects with AVNRT and right-sided accessory pathways derived the greatest benefit as did those requiring prolonged fluoroscopy by the conventional approach </plain></SENT>
