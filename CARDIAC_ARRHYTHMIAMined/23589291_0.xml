<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction of hERG channels due to mutations or certain medications causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> which can lead to fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the abundance of hERG in the plasma membrane is a key determinant of the hERG functionality, the mechanisms underlying its regulation are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of the stress-responsive serum- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-inducible kinase (SGK) isoforms SGK1 and SGK3 increased the current and expression level of the membrane-localized mature proteins of hERG channels stably expressed in HEK 293 (hERG-HEK) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the synthetic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, increased the current and abundance of mature ERG proteins in both hERG-HEK cells and neonatal cardiac myocytes through the enhancement of SGK1 but not SGK3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that mature hERG channels are degraded by ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 via enhanced channel ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we showed that SGK1 or SGK3 overexpression increased Nedd4-2 phosphorylation which is known to inhibit Nedd4-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, disruption of the Nedd4-2 binding site in hERG channels did not eliminate the SGK-induced increase in hERG expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional disruption of Rab11 proteins led to a complete elimination of SGK-mediated increase in hERG expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that SGK enhances the expression level of mature hERG channels by inhibiting Nedd4-2 as well as by promoting Rab11-mediated hERG recycling </plain></SENT>
