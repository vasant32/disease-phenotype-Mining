<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the carrying out of this important examination by classical devices during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> is uncomfortable and sometimes stressful for the patient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tried to overcome these difficulties using Whealthy(Â®) (Wearable Health Care System), a wearable system in a T-shirt composed of conductors and piezoresistive materials, integrated to form fibers and threads connected to tissular sensors, electrodes, and connectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG and pneumographic impedance signals are acquired by the electrodes in the tissue, and the data are registered by a small computer and transmitted via GPRS or Bluetooth </plain></SENT>
