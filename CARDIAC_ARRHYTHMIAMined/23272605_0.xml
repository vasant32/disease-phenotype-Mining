<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: Implantation of cardiac cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) is an established modality in the primary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) in patients (pts) with left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, fulfillment of this recommendation in our country is associated with a substantial increase in healthcare costs and results in a progressive elongation of waiting lines comprised of individuals qualified to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, this situation substantiates the search for additional noninvasive markers enabling the stratification of patients into high- and low risk groups so that the order of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation procedures favors those at higher risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) can be a helpful test in this matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of SCD episodes and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> - VT, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> - <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) in a group of pts with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who were qualified to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in primary prevention of SCD and had negative result of MTWA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included pts with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; or =35%, who were qualified to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in primary prevention of SCD and had negative result of MTWA (spectral method, CH2000 system, Cambridge Heart) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pts were followed up (scheduled visits every 3 months) and, among others, screened for adverse events (SCD/VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 115 pts analyzed for MTWA in the course of qualification to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, 49 individuals (mean age 58 +/- 13 years, LVEF 30 +/- 6%) were enrolled to further analysis due to negative result of this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow up was 9 +/- 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of analyzed pts had episodes of SCD/ <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>/VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On follow up, SCD/VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> episodes were not recorded amongst patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who were qualified to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation in primary prevention of SCD and had negative results of MTWA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After taking other potential risk factors into account, the negative MTWA result will probably enable identification of patients in whom the implantation can be postponed in favor of individuals who urgently require this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings </plain></SENT>
