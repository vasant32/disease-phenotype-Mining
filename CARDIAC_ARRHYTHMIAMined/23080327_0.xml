<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is now well established that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) implantation reduces mortality in patients at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the best programming parameters remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our traditional policy has followed a simple approach in the vast majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In accordance with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> programming in the major randomized clinical trials, we programmed a single high-rate, shock-only therapy zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to demonstrate in this observational study that simple programming is not associated with higher shock rates or mortality when compared to other published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent single-chamber <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation with single-zone, high-rate programming at our institution between 1993 and 2008 were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively in a database regarding details of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> implantation, demographic data, and indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two patients were included in our study, 31 % primary prevention and 68 % secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean ejection fraction (EF) is 33.7 ± 15.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over a mean follow-up period of 62.5 ± 38.1 months, 135 patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock (annualized event rate 7.7 %); 89 patients (26.8 %) appropriate shock in VT-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>), 68 patients (20.5 %) inappropriate shocks, and 22 patients (6.6 %) both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients (8.7 %) were reprogrammed to additional VT-ATP zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (6.6 %) patients underwent heart transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients (18.6 %) died during follow-up, 43.6 % out of them due to cardiac cause, mainly progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that simpler settings with single-zone, high-rate programming is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shock rates and long-term mortality that does not appear to be worse when compared with contemporary studies which include multizone <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> programming with antitachycardia pacing activated </plain></SENT>
