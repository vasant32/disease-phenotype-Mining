<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart rate variability (HRV) examines cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> activity controlling the sinus node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate HRV in a cohort of children with <z:mp ids='MP_0010432'>univentricular hearts</z:mp>, focusing on the relation between HRV and surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 112 children with Fontan circulation, HRV was analyzed using power spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spectral power was determined in three regions: very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), and high-frequency (HF) regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were compared with 66 healthy controls subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with LT were compared with patients who had EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The children with Fontan circulation showed a significantly reduced HRV including total power (P &lt; 0.0001), VLF (P &lt; 0.0001), LF (P &lt; 0.0001), and HF (P = 0.001) compared with the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LT and EC patients did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced HRV was found in both the LT and EC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In terms of HRV reduction, EC was not superior to LT </plain></SENT>
