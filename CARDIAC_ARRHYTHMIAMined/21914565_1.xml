<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a new design of an "optrode" (bundle of optical fibers) for use in intramural cardiac mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The optrodes are made from seven optical fibers with the fiber ends polished at 45Â° angle and coated with mirror surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optrodes are enclosed in smooth <z:chebi fb="48" ids="30721">epoxy</z:chebi> resin cast, which protects mirror surfaces from damage and ensures constant optrode diameter along its length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optrodes are strong enough to be easily inserted into heart muscle, can be reused multiple times, and they may reduce artifacts in the measurements of the effects of defibrillation shocks on V(m) </plain></SENT>
