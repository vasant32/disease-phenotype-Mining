<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep disordered breathing</z:e> (SDB) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> patients becomes increasingly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reliable exploring tool of SDB well adapted to cardiologists practice would be very useful for the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed a novel multi-modal electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter which incorporated both thoracic impedance and pulse oximetry signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared in a home setting, a standard condition for Holter recordings, results from the novel device to a classical ambulatory polygraph in subjects with suspected SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> in relationship with SDB is also presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 118 patients clinically suspected of having SDB were evaluated (mean age 57 ± 14 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32 ± 6 kg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The new device allows calculating a new index called thoracic impedance (TI) disturbance index (TIDI+) evaluated from TI and SpO(2) signals recorded from a Holter monitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the population under study, 93% had more than 70% of usable TI signal and 95% had more than 90% for SpO(2) during sleep time recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screening performance results based on automatic analysis is accurate: TIDI + demonstrates a high level of sensitivity (96.8%), specificity (72.3%) as well as positive (82.4%) and negative (94.4%) predictive value for the detection of SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, detection of SDB periods permits us to observe a possible respiratory association of several nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multi-modal Holter should be considered as a valuable evaluating tool for SDB screening and as a case selection technique for facilitating access to a full polysomnography for severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it offers a unique opportunity to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> consequences with both respiratory and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> disturbances </plain></SENT>
