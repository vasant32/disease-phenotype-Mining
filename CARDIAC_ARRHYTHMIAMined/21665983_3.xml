<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the long-term freedom from recurrent VAs by using endocardial-alone ablation versus endo-epicardial substrate-based ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> undergoing ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) were divided into 2 groups: endocardial-alone ablation (group 1, n = 23) and endo-epicardial ablation (group 2, n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional and 3D mappings were used to determine the mechanism of induced VTs and to identify area of "scar" or "abnormal" myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> critical sites responsible for VTs and points with "abnormal" potential were targeted for ablation from endocardium (group 1) or from both endocardium and epicardium (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedural end point was noninducibility of sustained, monomorphic VT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> at the end of ablation was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up by ECG, Holter, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> interrogation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of at least 3 years, freedom from VAs or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy was 52.2% (12/23) in group 1 and 84.6% (22/26) in group 2 (P = 0.029), with 21.7% (5/23) and 69.2% (18/26) patients off antiarrhythmic drugs (P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> after ablation, patients with frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> after ablation were more likely to have VA recurrence/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> therapy [3/33 (9%) versus 12/16 (75%); log-rank P&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An endo-epicardial-based ablation strategy achieves higher long-term freedom from recurrent VAs off antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> when compared with endocardial-alone ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of â‰¥ 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> per minute after ablation is associated with more VA recurrence </plain></SENT>
