<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data regarding ablations using a novel bidirectional catheter in a tertiary cardiac center and compared these in 1:5 ratio with a control group of procedures matched for age, gender, operator, and ablation type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 50 cases and 250 controls of median age 60 (50-68) years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was equally prevalent in both groups (39%) while history of previous ablations was more common in the study arm (54% vs 30%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the ablation cases were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (46%), followed by atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> (28%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (12%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median procedure duration was 128 (52-147) minutes with the bidirectional, versus 143 (105-200) minutes with the conventional catheter (P = 0.232), and median fluoroscopy time was 17 (10-34) minutes versus 23 (12-39) minutes, respectively (P = 0.988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward a lower procedure duration for the atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> ablations, 89 (52-147) minutes versus 130 (100-210) minutes, P = 0.064 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedure was successfully completed in 96% of the bidirectional versus 84% of the control cases (P = 0.151) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation was observed between the relative fluoroscopy duration and the case number (r = -0.312, P = 0.028), reflecting the learning curve for the bidirectional catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the bidirectional catheter resulted in no prolongation of procedure parameters and similar success rates, while there was a trend toward a lower procedure duration for atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> ablations </plain></SENT>
