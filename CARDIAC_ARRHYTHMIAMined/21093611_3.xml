<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe the incidence and clinical risk associated with postdischarge new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856742" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">post-MI</z:e> patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population included 271 post-MI patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% and no history of previous AF from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac Arrhythmias</z:hpo> and Risk Stratification after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (CARISMA) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were implanted with an implantable cardiac monitor and followed up every 3 months for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major cardiovascular events were defined as reinfarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF is highest during the first 2 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MI (16% event rate) and decreases until month 12 post-MI, after which the risk for new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF is stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of major cardiovascular events was increased in patients with AF events ≥ 30 seconds (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 2.73 [1.35 to 5.50], P = .005), but not in patients with AF events lasting &lt;30 seconds (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.17 [0.35 to 3.92], P = .80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded AF events were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using an implantable cardiac monitor, the incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF was found to be 4-fold higher than earlier reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the study population, in which treatment with beta-blockers was optimized, the vast majority of AF events were asymptomatic, emphasizing the importance of using continuous monitoring for studies concerning AF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A duration of 30 seconds or more identified clinically important AF episodes documented by an implantable cardiac monitor </plain></SENT>
