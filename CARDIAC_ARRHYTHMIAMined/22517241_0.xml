<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper assesses the safety and efficacy of nonanesthesiologist-administered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> in a large series of colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective registry of consecutive American Society of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">Anesthetics</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) class I and II outpatients undergoing colonoscopy was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">Propofol</z:chebi>, administered by a nurse under an endoscopist's supervision, was the sole sedative agent used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1000 patients (563 women/437 men, mean age 57, range 8-89 years) included in the study, 57.4% showed <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> I and 42.6% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cecal intubation rate was 96.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>48.2% of the procedures were for therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> dose was 177 mg (range 50-590 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Doses correlated inversely with patient age (r=-0.38; P&lt;0.001) and were lower in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II patients (P&lt;0.001) and in diagnostic (rather than therapeutic) exams (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average recovery time (from extracting the colonoscope to patient discharge) was 18.6 min (range 4-75) and longer in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II patients (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A pulse oximetry saturation of less than 90% and a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg were observed in 24 (2.4%) and 385 (35.8%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both events were more frequent in patients older than 65 years (P&lt;0.05); the latter was more common in <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy under endoscopist-controlled <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation in low-risk patients is safe and effective, allowing for a complete exploration, although patients at least 65 years old and/or classified as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> II are more likely to present a decrease in blood pressure and have a prolonged recovery time </plain></SENT>
