<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The purpose of this EP wire is to examine clinical practice in the field of out-of-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (OHCA) management, with special focus on in-hospital diagnostic and therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-three European centres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the EHRA-EP Research network, completed the questions of the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dedicated strategy for OHCA management is active in 85% of the centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shockable tachyarrhythmias such as initial OHCA rhythm are reported in &gt;70% of the patients in 64% of the centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-hospital therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was applied in &gt;50% of the patients in 53% of the centres and in &lt;50% in 47% of the centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the year 2011 90% of the centres performed &gt;10 primary percutaneous coronary angioplasties (PCI) in OHCA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate, when the initial documented rhythm was shockable, was &gt;30% in 42% of the centres, and conversely, was significantly lower when <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340861" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="EMD">pulseless electrical activity</z:e> was the initial rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A favourable neurological recovery was reported in &gt;50% of the patients in 13 (26%) centres and in 21-50% of the patients in 21 (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This EP wire survey demonstrates a favourable implementation in OHCA of an invasive management strategy, including coronary angiography/PCI and implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy, while therapeutic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> appears to be underused </plain></SENT>
