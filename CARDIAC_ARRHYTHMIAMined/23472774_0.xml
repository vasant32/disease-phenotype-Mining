<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> evaluation clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In instances when the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> management clinic) is clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step </plain></SENT>
