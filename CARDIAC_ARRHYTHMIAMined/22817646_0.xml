<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> encountered in clinical practice, is often managed with a rhythm control strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the emphasis on symptom relief as the motivation for a rhythm controlling strategy in AF, it remains unclear what factors affect the patient's experienced severity of AF symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that demographic variables may affect AF symptom severity as many AF symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>) are nonspecific and may require particular patient insight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed demographic variables, cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, AF burden, and AF-specific self-reported symptom severity in a cohort of 300 outpatients with AF presenting to outpatient electrophysiology clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, decreased educational attainment, unemployed working status, and non-Caucasian race were associated with worsened AF symptom severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for potential confounders, the association of decreased educational attainment with worsened AF symptom severity persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Possible links between these demographic features and AF symptom severity are socioeconomic status and health literacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further study into the relationship between educational attainment and AF symptom severity is warranted </plain></SENT>
