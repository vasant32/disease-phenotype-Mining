<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No study has been published that compared persistence and discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with other long-term medications in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate persistence and discontinuation patterns in AF patients taking <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and other common long-term medications and identify predictors of persistence and discontinuation in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prescription within 3 months after AF hospitalization discharge and 12-month data before and after the first prescription were evaluated using administrative claims data (1 January 2005 - 31 December 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison, persistence patterns for other long-term medications for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, including once- (od) and twice- (bid) daily medications, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-persistence was defined as the presence of a ≥60-day gap in medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Permanent discontinuation was defined as no use of the medication for ≥90 days until the end of the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> non-persistence and discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28 384 patients with AF were identified; 16 036 (56.5%) had a <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> prescription following AF hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>53.5% of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> users were persistent for at least 1 year, similar to other long-term medications commonly prescribed to the AF population (ranging between 45.2% and 61.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>42.6% of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> users permanently discontinued <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> within 1 year, also consistent with the discontinuation rate of 32.9-52.0% of other long-term medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Residence in the South and West regions of the US, history of cardiac dysrhythmias, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> cost-sharing significantly decreased the likelihood of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> persistence and increased the likelihood of discontinuation, while older age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use before hospitalization significantly increased <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> persistence and decreased the likelihood of discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adherence of od and bid medications was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Persistence and discontinuation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in patients with AF is consistent with other long-term medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Identifying factors associated with non-persistence and discontinuation with long-term medications can help in developing targeted adherence programs </plain></SENT>
