<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Kleefstra syndrome is characterized by the core phenotype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, (childhood) <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and distinct facial features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome can be either caused by a microdeletion in chromosomal region 9q34.3 or by a mutation in the euchromatin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the early 1990s, 85 patients have been described, of which the majority had a 9q34.3 microdeletion (&gt;85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation could be observed by studying the clinical and molecular features of both 9q34.3 microdeletion patients and patients with an intragenic EHMT1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, to further expand the genotypic and phenotypic knowledge about the syndrome, we here report 29 newly diagnosed patients, including 16 patients with a 9q34.3 microdeletion and 13 patients with an EHMT1 mutation, and review previous literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present findings are comparable to previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to our former findings and recommendations, we suggest cardiac screening during follow-up, because of the possible occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinicians and caretakers should be aware of the regressive behavioral phenotype that might develop at adolescent/adult age and seems to have no clear neurological substrate, but is rather a so far unexplained neuropsychiatric feature </plain></SENT>
