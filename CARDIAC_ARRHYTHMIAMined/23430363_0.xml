<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Existing atrial models with detailed anatomical structure and multi-variable cardiac transmembrane current models are too complex to allow to combine an investigation of long time dycal properties of the heart rhythm with the ability to effectively simulate cardiac electrical activity during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other ways of modeling need to be investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, many state-of-the-art models of the right atrium do not include an atrioventricular node (AVN) and only rarely-the sinoatrial node (SAN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A model of the heart tissue within the right atrium including the SAN and AVN nodes was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Looking for a minimal model, currently we are testing our approach on chosen well-known <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which were until now obtained only using much more complicated models, or were only observed in a clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultimately, the goal is to obtain a model able to generate sequences of RR intervals specific for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> involving the AV junction as well as for other phenomena occurring within the atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model should be fast enough to allow the study of heart rate variability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> at a time scale of thousands of heart beats in real-time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the model of the right atrium proposed here, different kinds of cardiac tissues are described by sets of different equations, with most of them belonging to the class of Li√©nard nonlinear dynamical systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have developed a series of models of the right atrium with differing anatomical simplifications, in the form of a 2D mapping of the atrium or of an idealized cylindrical geometry, including only those anatomical details required to reproduce a given physiological phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The simulations allowed to reconstruct the phase relations between the sinus rhythm and the location and properties of a parasystolic source together with the effect of this source on the resultant heart rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We model the action potential conduction time alternans through the atrioventricular AVN junction observed in cardiac tissue in electrophysiological studies during the ventricular-triggered atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A simulation of the atrio-ventricular nodal reentry <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> was performed together with an entrainment procedure in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> circuit was located by measuring the post-pacing interval (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) at simulated mapping catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The generation and interpretation of RR times series is the ultimate goal of our research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, to reach that goal we need first to (1) somehow verify the validity of the model of the atrium with the nodes included and (2) include in the model the effect of the sympathetic and vagal ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The current paper serves as a partial solution of the 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In particular we show, that measuring the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>-TCL entrainment response in proximal (possibly-the slow-conducting pathway), the distal and at a mid-distance from CS could help in rapid distinction of AVNRT from other atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our simulations support the hypothesis that the alternans of the conduction time between the atria and the ventricles in the AV orthodromic reciprocating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> can occur within a single pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the atrial parasystole simulation, we found a mathematical condition which allows for a rough estimation of the location of the parasystolic source within the atrium, both for simplified (planar) and the cylindrical geometry of the atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The planar and the cylindrical geometry yielded practically the same results of simulations </plain></SENT>
