<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Medicare National Coverage Determination for permanent pacemaker, which emphasized single-chamber pacing, has not changed significantly since 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to define contemporary trends in permanent pacemaker use by analyzing a large national database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify permanent pacemaker implants between 1993 and 2009 using the International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification procedure codes for dual-chamber (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi>), single-ventricular (VVI), single-atrial (AAI), or biventricular (BiV) devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual permanent pacemaker implantation rates and patient demographics were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2009, 2.9 million patients received permanent pacemakers in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall use increased by 55.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 2009, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> use increased from 62% to 82% (p &lt; 0.001), whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use fell from 36% to 14% (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> devices was higher in urban, nonteaching hospitals (79%) compared with urban teaching hospitals (76%) and rural hospitals (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with private insurance (83%) more commonly received <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> devices than Medicaid (79%) or Medicare (75%) recipients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patient age and Charlson comorbidity index increased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hospital charges ($2011) increased 45.3%, driven by the increased cost of <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a steady growth in the use of permanent pacemakers in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="12" ids="27841">DDD</z:chebi> device use is increasing, whereas single-chamber ventricular pacemaker use is decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients are becoming older and have more medical comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These trends have important health care policy implications </plain></SENT>
