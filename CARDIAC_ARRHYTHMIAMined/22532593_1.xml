<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) and the management of this risk in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this meta-analysis was to define the incidence of SCD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> in patients with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White ECG pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic search of prospective, retrospective, randomized, or cohort English-language studies in EMBASE and Medline through February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies reporting asymptomatic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> who did not undergo ablation were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty studies involving 1869 patients met our inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants were primarily male with a mean age ranging from 7 to 43 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten SCDs were reported involving 11 722 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven studies originated from Italy and reported 9 SCDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of SCD is estimated at 1.25 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-2.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 156 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardias</z:hpo> were reported involving 9884 person-years from 18 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> was 16 (95% CI, 10-24) events per 1000 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Children had numerically higher SCD (1.93 [95% CI, 0.57-4.1] versus 0.86 [95% CI, 0.28-1.75]; P=0.07) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (20 [95% CI, 12-31] versus 14 [95% CI, 6-25]; P=0.38) event rates compared with adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The low incidence of SCD and low risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> argue against routine invasive management in most asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White ECG pattern </plain></SENT>
