<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed whether non-cardiovascular hERG channel blockers are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) and whether hERG-channel-inhibiting capacity is an indicator of the risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The risk of SCD was studied in the Integrated Primary Care Information database, a longitudinal general practice research database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was performed, matched for age, gender and calendar time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were calculated with conditional logistic regression, multivariably adjusted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the hERG-channel-inhibiting capacity of the different drugs was compared, defined as the effective free therapeutic plasma concentration (ETCP(unbound)) divided by the concentration that inhibits 50% of the <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channels (IC50), with the risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1424 cases of SCD and 14 443 controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Current use of hERG channel blockers was associated with an increased risk of SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of SCD was significantly increased in users of antipsychotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients using hERG channel blockers with a high ETCP(unbound)/IC50 ratio (â‰¥ 0.033) had a higher risk of SCD than patients using drugs with a low ETCP(unbound)/IC50 ratio (&lt;0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current use of hERG channel blockers was associated with an increased risk of SCD in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, drugs with a high hERG-channel-inhibiting capacity had a higher risk of SCD than drugs with a low hERG-channel-inhibiting capacity </plain></SENT>
