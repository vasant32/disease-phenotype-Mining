<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one CS patients presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>premature ventricular contractions</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp>, ≥300/day) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had nonsustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (NSVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, and the initial dosage is 30 mg/day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, which was tapered over a period of 6 months to a maintenance dosage of 10 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hour Holter monitoring, signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG), echocardiography, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 scintigraphy, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and plasma B-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) concentrations were assessed before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a whole, there were no significant differences in the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> and in the prevalence of NSVT before and after steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the less advanced LV dysfunction patients (EF ≥ 35%, n = 17) showed significant reduction in the number of <z:mp ids='MP_0010018'>PVCs</z:mp> (from 1820 ± 2969 to 742 ± 1425, P = 0.048) and in the prevalence of NSVT (from 41 to 6%, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late potentials on SAECG were abolished in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The less advanced LV dysfunction group showed a significantly higher prevalence of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi>-67 uptake compared with the advanced LV dysfunction group (EF &lt; 35 %, n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the advanced LV dysfunction patients, there were no significant differences in these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy may be effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> in the early stage, but less effective in the late stage </plain></SENT>
