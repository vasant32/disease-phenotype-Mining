<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to investigate the feasibility of transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) guidance for minimally invasive periventricular device closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>perimembranous ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSDs</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2011 to September 2011, we enrolled 18 young children with perimembranous <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSDs</z:mp> to receive minimally invasive device closure in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were examined by TTE to determine the <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, diameter, and rims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During intra-operative device closure, real-time bedside TTE alone was used to guide device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Device implantation using TTE guidance was successful in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symmetric devices were used in 14 patients, and asymmetric devices were used in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient experienced mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo>, and there were no instances of residual shunt, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, or device displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were transferred to surgical closure, one due to residual shunting and the other as a result of unsuccessful wire penetration of the <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> gap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that TTE-guided <z:mp ids='MP_0010402'>VSD</z:mp> closure is feasible in young children, although a longer follow-up may be needed to document the long-term success </plain></SENT>
