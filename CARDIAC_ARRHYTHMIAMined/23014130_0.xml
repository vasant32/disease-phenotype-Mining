<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite adequate rate control, the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) has been shown, in a number of studies, to hasten HF progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this context, we aimed to test the hypothesis that an irregular ventricular rhythm causes an alteration in ventricular cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction coupling which contributes to the progression of HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of electrical field stimulation (average frequency 2 Hz) in an irregular versus regular drive train pattern on the expression of calcium-handling genes and proteins in rat ventricular myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of rhythm on intracellular calcium transients was examined using Fura-2AM fluorescence spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conjunction, calcium-handling protein expression was examined in left ventricular samples obtained from end-stage HF patients, in patients with either persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with regularly paced ventricular cardiomyocytes, in cells paced irregularly for 24 hours, there was a significant reduction in the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca(2+)) ATPase together with reduced serine-16 phosphorylation of phospholamban </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings were accompanied by a 59% reduction (P&lt;0.01) in the peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transient in irregulary paced myocytes compared with those with regular pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, we observed a 54% (P&lt;0.05) decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase protein expression and an 85% (P&lt;0.01) reduction in the extent of phosphorylation of phospholamban in the left ventricular myocardium of HF patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> compared with those in sinus rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data demonstrate that ventricular rhythmicity contributes significantly to excitation-contraction coupling by altering the expression and activity of key calcium-handling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that control of rhythm may be of benefit in patients with HF </plain></SENT>
