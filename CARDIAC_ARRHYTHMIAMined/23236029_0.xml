<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of implantable loop recorders (ILRs) and tilt testing (TT) to direct pacing therapy in people with recurrent episodes of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> that are adversely affecting their quality of life or represent a high risk of injury and are suspected to be vasovagal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Decision analytical modelling was used to estimate the costs and benefits of diagnostic testing including the costs and benefits of treatment for several clinically important <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> following diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A UK National Health Service and personal social services perspective was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: People with recurrent episodes of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> that are adversely affecting their quality of life or represent a high risk of injury and which are suspected to be vasovagal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: The diagnostic test strategies compared were TT alone, TT followed by ILR (if TT 'negative'), ILR alone and no further testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Benefits measured using quality-adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ICERs for TT alone, ILR alone and TT followed by ILR were £5960, £24 620 and £19 110, respectively, compared with no testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ILR alone was extendedly dominated by the other strategies, meaning that it is never the most cost-effective option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis found that the cost-effectiveness estimates were robust despite the areas of uncertainty identified in the evidence and assumptions used to inform the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TT alone is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy in this population </plain></SENT>
