<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To unravel the sequence of myocardial alterations and to identify potential pathomechanisms, histological analyses were performed on mutant hearts from the juvenile to the adult state, i.e., between 2 and 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At an age of 2 weeks 30% of mutants presented lesions,which were visible as white plaques on the heart surface or in the septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 4 weeks onwards, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutants displayed a cardiac phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dying cardiomyocytes with calcification were found in lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But lesions of young mutant animals contained high amounts of CD45+ immune cells and little collagen fibers, whereas lesions of the older animals were collagen-rich and harbored only a small but still significantly increased number of CD45+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy further showed that distinct desmosomes cannot be distinguished in intercalated discs of mutant hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Widening of the intercellular cleft and even complete dissociation of intercalated discs were often observed close to lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disturbed sarcomer structure, altered Z-discs, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0011632'>swollen mitochondria</z:mp> were other prominent pathological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the following scenario is suggested: mutant desmoglein 2 cannot fully support the increased mechanical requirements placed on intercalated disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> during postnatal heart development, resulting in compromised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and cell stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This induces cardiomyocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, aseptic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and fibrotic replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of scar formation is followed by permanent impairment of the cardiac function </plain></SENT>
