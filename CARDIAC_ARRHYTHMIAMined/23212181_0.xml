<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare (QOL) scores among pediatric device patients, healthy controls, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) patients and determine the key drivers of QOL in pediatric device patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Multicenter, cross-sectional study at 8 pediatric centers of subjects aged 8 to 18 years with either a pacemaker or defibrillator was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient-parent pairs completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QOL outcomes in device patients were compared with healthy controls and patients with various forms of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Structural equation modeling was used to test for differences in Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory scores among (1) device type, (2) presence of CHD, and (3) hypothesized key drivers of QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred seventy-three patient-parent pairs (40 defibrillators/133 pacemakers) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with healthy controls, patients with devices and their parents reported significantly lower Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, compared with patients with mild forms of CHD, parents and patients with devices reported significantly lower Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory scores and were similar to patients with more severe CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Key drivers of patient QOL were presence of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patients, self-perception was a key driver of lower QOL, whereas for parents behavioral issues were associated with lower QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patient QOL is significantly affected by the presence of cardiac rhythm devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whether these effects can be mitigated through the use of psychotherapy needs to be assessed </plain></SENT>
