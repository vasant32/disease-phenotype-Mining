<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Impedance changes during RF delivery are used as a surrogate for CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between impedance and real time CF in humans remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether impedance changes have predictive value for real-time CF during catheter ablation of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Real-time CF, force-time integral (FTI) and impedance were measured in 2265 RF lesions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> or flutter in 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operators were blinded to CF measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impedance pre-ablation, at 5s intervals for 30s post RF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and maximal impedance fall during RF were correlated with CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Average CF was categorized into low (≤ 20g), intermediate (21-60g) or high (&gt;60g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-ablation impedance poorly correlated with pre-ablation CF (R=.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Maximal impedance fall modestly correlated with average CF and FTI (R=.32 and .37 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a large degree of overlap in impedance fall between different CF categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A maximal impedance fall of 10Ω could predict average CF of &gt;20g with sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 53% and positive and negative predictive values of 51% and 49% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Impedance fall was only able to differentiate between different CF categories ≥15 seconds post RF <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Higher contact forces moderately correlated with delayed plateau in impedance (R=.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impedance measurements (both baseline and impedance fall) are, at best, moderately efficacious as surrogate markers for predicting real-time catheter-tissue CF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the importance of real-time CF measurements, rather than impedance changes to optimize ablation efficacy </plain></SENT>
