<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: -<z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>Myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> is a hallmark of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001639'>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (HCM) and a potential substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sarcomere mutations appear to induce profibrotic changes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further evaluate these processes, we used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with T1 measurements on a genotyped HCM population to quantify myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: -Sarcomere mutation carriers with LVH (G+/LVH+, n = 37) and without LVH (G+/LVH-, n = 29); HCM patients without mutations (sarcomere-negative HCM, n = 11); and healthy controls (n = 11) underwent contrast CMR, measuring T1 times pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concurrent echocardiography and serum biomarkers of collagen synthesis, hemodynamic stress, and myocardial injury were also available in a subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to controls, ECV was increased in patients with overt HCM, as well as G+/LVH- mutation carriers (ECV= 0.36±0.01, 0.33±0.01, 0.27±0.01 in G+/LVH+, G+/LVH-, controls, respectively, P≤0.001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECV correlated with NT-proBNP levels (r = 0.58, P&lt;0.001) and global E' velocity (r = -0.48, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement (LGE) was present in &gt;60% of overt HCM patients but absent from G+/LVH- subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both ECV and LGE were more extensive in sarcomeric HCM than sarcomere-negative HCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: -Myocardial ECV is increased in HCM sarcomere mutation carriers even in the absence of LVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data provide additional support that fibrotic remodeling is triggered early in disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Quantifying ECV may help characterize the development <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> in HCM and ultimately assist in developing novel disease-modifying therapy, targeting interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
