<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are minimal published data on CF and ventricular lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the impact of CF on lesion formation using an ovine model both endocardially and epicardially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty sheep received 160 epicardial and 160 endocardial ventricular radiofrequency applications using either a 3.5-mm irrigated-tip catheter (Thermocool, Biosense-Webster, n=160) or a 3.5 irrigated-tip catheter with CF assessment (Tacticath, Endosense, n=160), via percutaneous access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Power was delivered at 30 watts for 60 seconds, when either catheter/tissue contact was felt to be good or when CF&gt;10 g with Tacticath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After completion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dimensions were taken at pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identifiable lesion formation from radiofrequency application was improved with the aid of CF information, from 78% to 98% on the endocardium (P&lt;0.001) and from 90% to 100% on the epicardium (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean total force was greater on the endocardium (39±18 g versus 21±14 g for the epicardium; P&lt;0.001) mainly because of axial force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the force-time integral being greater endocardially, epicardial lesions were larger (231±182 mm(3) versus 209±131 mm(3); P=0.02) probably because of the absence of the heat sink effect of the circulating blood and covered a greater area (41±27 mm(2) versus 29±17 mm(2); P=0.03) because of catheter orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of CF feedback, 22% of endocardial radiofrequency applications that are thought to have good contact did not result in lesion formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epicardial ablation is associated with larger lesions </plain></SENT>
