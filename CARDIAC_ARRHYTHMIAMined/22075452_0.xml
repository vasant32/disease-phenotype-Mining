<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibition on repolarization as a novel antiarrhythmic concept in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was induced by rapid ventricular pacing in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) showed a prolongation of repolarization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> and stimulation at different cycle lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sotalol (100 μM, n = 13) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> (0.5 μM; n = 15) resulted in a further significant increase in the MAP duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> was associated with an increased dispersion of repolarization, as compared with sotalol-treated (+22 ± 7 ms; P &lt; .05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi>-treated (+20 ± 6 ms; P &lt; .05) sham hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of a low <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> concentration, sotalol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi> reproducibly induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SEA0400 (1 μM), a pharmacological inhibitor of NCX, significantly shortened the MAP duration (P &lt; .01) and reduced dispersion (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It suppressed EAD in 6 of 13 sotalol-treated failing hearts and in 9 of 10 veratridine-treated failing hearts, leading to a reduction in VT (60% in sotalol-treated failing hearts and 83% in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28051">veratridine</z:chebi>-treated failing hearts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simulations using a mathematical model showed a reduction in the action potential duration and the number of EADs by the NCX block in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In an experimental model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> inhibition of NCX (1) reduces the MAP duration, (2) decreases dispersion of repolarization, and (3) suppresses EAD and VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate for the first time that pharmacological NCX inhibition increases repolarization reserve and protects against VTs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
