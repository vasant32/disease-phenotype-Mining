<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several risk factors related to the patient or catheterization were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complications was 6.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common major and minor complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> that required intervention and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of complications during interventional studies was higher (9.7%) when compared to that in diagnostic procedures (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent risk of any complication was greatest up to 1 year of age (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risks of a major complication (p = 0.003) and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) were significantly greater in patients &lt;1 year of age by univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risks of pediatric cardiac catheterization continue to decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The complication rates associated with interventional catheterization were significantly higher than with diagnostic catheterization in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Younger age, particularly &lt;1 year of age, is the strongest predictor of development of any complication </plain></SENT>
