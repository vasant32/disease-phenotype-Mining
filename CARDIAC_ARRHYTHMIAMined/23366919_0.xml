<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most of the abnormal cardiac events such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> can be diagnosed through continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to recent clinical research, early detection and alarming of such cardiac events can reduce the time delay to the hospital, and the clinical outcomes of these individuals can be greatly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it would be helpful if there is a long-term ECG monitoring system with the ability to identify abnormal cardiac events and provide realtime warning for the users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination of the wireless body area sensor network (BASN) and the on-sensor ECG processor is a possible solution for this application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we aim to design and implement a digital signal processor that is suitable for continuous ECG monitoring and alarming based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) through the proposed architectures--using both programmable RISC processor and application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for performance optimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the implementation results, the power consumption of the proposed processor integrated with an ASIC for CWT computation is only 79.4 mW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the single-RISC processor, about 91.6% of the power reduction is achieved </plain></SENT>
