<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The QRS detection and segmentation processes constitute the first stages of a greater process, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG) feature extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their accuracy is a prerequisite to a satisfactory performance of the P and T wave segmentation, and also to the reliability of the heart rate variability analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This work presents an innovative approach of QRS detection and segmentation and the detailed results of the proposed algorithm based on First-Derivative, Hilbert and Wavelet Transforms, adaptive threshold and an approach of surface indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method combines the adaptive threshold, Hilbert and Wavelet Transforms techniques, avoiding the whole ECG signal preprocessing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After each QRS detection, the computation of an indicator related to the area covered by the QRS complex envelope provides the detection of the QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and offset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The QRS detection proposed technique is evaluated based on the well-known <z:chebi fb="75" ids="27847,53620">MIT</z:chebi>-BIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> and QT databases, obtaining the average sensitivity of 99.15% and the positive predictability of 99.18% for the first database, and 99.75% and 99.65%, respectively, for the second one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The QRS segmentation approach is evaluated on the annotated QT database with the average segmentation errors of 2.85±9.90ms and 2.83±12.26ms for QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and offset, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those results demonstrate the accuracy of the developed algorithm for a wide variety of QRS <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the adaptation of the algorithm parameters to the existing QRS morphological variations within a single record </plain></SENT>
