<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advances in this field have included, first, the development of techniques of catheter ablation that often requires the precise destruction of minute amounts of arrhythmogenic tissues and, second, techniques of resynchronization therapy that require pacing different parts of the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A detailed prepocedural knowledge of cardiac <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> can improve the safety of the procedure and its rate success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It helps the electrophysiologist to choose the appropiate region for ablation, shortening the procedural time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The atrial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> structures are usually localized before ablation by different imaging techniques such as fluoroscopy, electroanatomic mapping, intracardiac echocardiography or multidetector computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the atria, highlighting the landmarks of interest to intervencional cardiologist, stressing their relationship to other structures </plain></SENT>
