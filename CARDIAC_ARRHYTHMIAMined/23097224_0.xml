<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of implanted devices are poorly documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify risk factors in patients with long-term follow-up after implantation of cardiac devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with first implantation of a cardiac device in our centre between October 1996 and July 2007 were entered in a registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the implanted device was matched to two controls for age, sex, and implantation year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recorded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), previous history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, as well as pre- and post-procedural characteristics (antibiotic prophylaxis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, number of leads, associated interventions, and early complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 2496 patients underwent implantation of a cardiac device; 35 infections were diagnosed (1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among these, 75% occurred during the first year after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early non-infectious complication requiring surgical intervention was observed only in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (9 of 35, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [odds ratio (OR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.03, 12.97]], underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> (OR 3.12, 95% CI [1.13; 8.69]), and use of &gt;1 lead (OR 4.07, 95% CI [1.23, 13.47]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These latter two risk factors were also independently associated with occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> within 1 year of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> are independent risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after cardiac device implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As regards procedural characteristics, the use of several leads and early re-intervention are associated with a higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate </plain></SENT>
