<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on three genetically determined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>: hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011663'>arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> (ARVC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four genes have so far been associated with these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathies</z:hpo>, but the disease-causing effect of reported variants is often dubious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to identify possible false-positive variants, we investigated the prevalence of previously reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-associated variants in recently published exome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We searched for reported missense and nonsense variants in the NHLBI-Go Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) containing exome data from 6500 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ESP, we identified 94 variants out of 687 (14%) variants previously associated with HCM, 58 out of 337 (17%) variants associated with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and 38 variants out of 209 (18%) associated with ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings correspond to a genotype prevalence of 1:4 for HCM, 1:6 for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi>, and 1:5 for ARVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PolyPhen-2 predictions were conducted on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously published <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>-associated missense variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found significant overrepresentation of variants predicted as being benign among those present in ESP compared with the ones not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to validate our findings, seven variants associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> were genotyped in a control population and this revealed frequencies comparable with the ones found in ESP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we identified genotype prevalences up to more than one thousand times higher than expected from the phenotype prevalences in the general population (HCM 1:500, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> 1:2500, and ARVC 1:5000) and our data suggest that a high number of these variants are not monogenic causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 9 January 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.283 </plain></SENT>
