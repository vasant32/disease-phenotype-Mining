<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> can improve postoperative outcome in patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> undergoing heart valve operations was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 3,217 patients undergoing isolated valve procedures at 2 institutions between May 2003 and May 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two propensity-matched cohorts of 1,104 patients each were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable regression and Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis were performed to investigate risk factors correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality rate was 2.7%, and 2,096 of 2,149 hospital survivors were alive at a median follow-up of 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.89; p=0.001), postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.93; p&lt;0.006), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.92; p=0.02) but was not independently associated with a reduced risk of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis showed statistically significant lower rates of mortality (χ2, 4.41; hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.27; p=0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (χ2, 11.42; HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.27; p=0.0007), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (χ2, 19.9; HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.81 to 2.72; p&lt;0.0001), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (χ2, 3.74; HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.74; p=0.05) in patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between groups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> incidence at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> therapy is associated with a lower rate of adverse cardiovascular events after isolated heart valve operations </plain></SENT>
