<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 68 children with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> from January 1998 to March 2011 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The children were classified into three groups: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=42), non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=20) and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVED), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>Abnormal ECG</z:mp> results were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 68 children with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>Sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> (91%) and ectopic pulsatile (86%) were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVED in the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group (74±6 mm) was greater than that in the non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group (65±4 mm; P&lt;0.05) and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group (61±3 mm; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LVED in the non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group was also greater than that in the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LVEF and LVFS in the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group were (30±11)% and (22±4)%, respectively, which were lower than those in the non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group［(37±12)% and (28±5)%, respectively］and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> group［(45±9)% and (34±7)%, respectively］(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were also significant differences in the LVEF and LVFS between the non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The common <z:mp ids='MP_0010508'>abnormal ECG</z:mp> findings are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> and ectopic pulsatile in children with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Arrhythmia</z:hpo> is one of the main clinical manifestations of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="15767">DCM</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> is associated with the left ventricular size and heart function </plain></SENT>
