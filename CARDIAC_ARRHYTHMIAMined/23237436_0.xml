<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 140 men aged 52.5+/-1.3 years with primary diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Q-wave MI</z:e> and I-IV Lown grade VHRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized in 2 groups: index group (A) and control group (B) consisted of 70 persons each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients of index and control groups were divided into another 2 groups by severity of arrhythmic syndrome: Al (n=39) and Bl (n=38) with I-III grade VHRDs; A2 (n=31) and B2 (n=32) with IV-V grade VHRDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In index groups (Al and A2) ω-3 PUFA medicine was administered additionally to standard therapy at a dose of 1 g/day during 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent standard clinical examination and 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring on days 10-14 and in 6 months after MI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Decreases of single and paired <z:hpo ids='HP_0006682'>ventricular extrasystoles</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> runs, total duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> were observed in patients of index groups Al and A2 after ω-3 PUFAs treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months of ω-3 PUFAs treatment significant QT shortening and increase of QTc variability were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numbers of patients with LVP in Al and A2 groups decreased 21.3% (p&lt;0.05) and 38.7% (p&lt;0.0l), with HRT - 20.5% and 29.1% (p&lt;0.05), with MTWA - 18% and 16.1% (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control groups the result was statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of 1 g/day of a prescription preparation of 90% ω-3 PUFAs in patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0861151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Q-wave MI</z:e> was associated with decrease of ventricular ectopy severity in patients with low and high grade VHRD and simultaneous reduction of total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> time. ω-3 PUFAs administration for 6 months had marked positive effect on QT duration and variability, LVP, HRT, MTWA </plain></SENT>
