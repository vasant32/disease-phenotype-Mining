<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chronotropic incompetence (CI) is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments that improve pulmonary function and exercise capacity may affect CI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives are to evaluate CI before and after lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and determine if changes in CI are associated with changes in pulmonary function and exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 75 patients who underwent LVRS and who had complete cardiopulmonary exercise testing and concurrent pulmonary function tests two months before and about 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally we evaluated 28 control patients that were randomized to medical treatment as part of the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>Emphysema</z:hpo> Treatment Trial at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied CI using the percent of predicted heart rate reserve=(heart rate peak-heart rate rest)/((208-0.7×age)-heart rate rest)×100, before and after surgery and compared it to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean percent of predicted heart rate reserve improved from 41% to 50% (p-value &lt;0.001) after LVRS, while the control group did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean forced vital capacity and expiratory volume in 1s, peak oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, ventilation, tidal volume and maximal workload <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved in the surgery group, while the controls did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CI improves after LVRS in a population of patients with COPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CI improvements are associated with the increases in pulmonary function and exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This improvement is seen in a domain of known cardiopulmonary impairment prior to surgery that improves as a positive response to the therapy of LVRS </plain></SENT>
