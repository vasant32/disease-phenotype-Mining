<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with HFREF (aged 61 ± 9.9 years) were randomly assigned to HIIE corresponding to 2 × 8 minutes of 30-second intervals at 100% of peak power output and 30-second passive recovery intervals and to a 22-minute MICE corresponding to 60% of peak power output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gas exchange, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure were measured continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac troponin T (cTnT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) were measured before, 20 minutes after, and 24 hours after HIIE and MICE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary responses did not differ between MICE and HIIE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher exercise adherence and efficiency were observed on HIIE with a similar perceived exertion and time spent above 90% of peak oxygen consumption compared with MICE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither HIIE nor MICE caused any significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> or increased CRP, BNP, or cTnT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MICE, HIIE demonstrated a higher exercise adherence and was well tolerated in patients with HFREF, while still providing a high-level physiological stimulus and leaving indices of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (CRP), myocardial dysfunction (BNP), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001700'>myocardial necrosis</z:hpo> (cTnT) unaffected </plain></SENT>
