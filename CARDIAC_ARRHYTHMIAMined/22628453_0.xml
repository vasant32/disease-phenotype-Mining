<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different algorithms to reduce uVP in an adult population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011704'>sick sinus syndrome</z:hpo> (SSS) treated outside of clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the relationship between different types of pacing algorithms and clinical outcomes is also provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a single-centre, observational, parallel study, based on retrospective analysis of the Arrhythmology Cardiology Center of Armenia electronic clinical database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated atrial pacing percentage (AP%), ventricular pacing percentage (VP%), and the incidence of atrial high rate episodes in 56 patients with SSS using three different pacing strategies: managed VP, search atrioventricular (AV), and fixed long AV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did not find statistically significant differences in the amount of VP between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the atrial high rate percentage (AHR%) tended to be higher in the fixed long AV group, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean VP% and AP% were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three programmed strategies produced the same mean AP% and VP%, and were equally efficient in uVP reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship between chosen algorithms and the incidence of pacemaker syndrome, hospitalizations, or change in New York Heart Association class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of AHR was not associated with pacing strategy or co-morbidities but showed borderline correlation with left atrial size </plain></SENT>
