<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, these action potentials propagate to the whole heart via its conduction system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of impulse generation and/or propagation in a heart can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, SAN dysfunction or conduction block of the atrioventricular node can lead to serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> which is currently treated with an implanted electronic pacemaker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, conduction damage may cause reentrant tachyarrhythmias which are primarily treated pharmacologically or by medical device-based therapies, including defibrillation and tissue ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, drug therapies sometimes may not be effective or are associated with serious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Device-based therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, even with well developed technology, still face inadequacies, limitations, hardware complications, and other challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, scientists are actively seeking other alternatives for antiarrhythmic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In particular, cells and genes used for repairing cardiac conduction damage/defect have been investigated in various studies both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite the complexities of the excitation and conduction systems of the heart, cell and gene-based strategies provide novel alternatives for treatment or cure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes some highlights of recent research progress in this field </plain></SENT>
