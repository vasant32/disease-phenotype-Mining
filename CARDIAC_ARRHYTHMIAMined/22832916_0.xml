<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recognition of the pathogenic mechanism and the characterization of the activation pathway are usually obtained by indirect measures with entrainment mapping and pacing manoeuvres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied a 61-years-old patient with a history of previous inferior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and we provided the in vivo direct visualization of the critical components of re-entry circuit by non-contact mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VT circuit entrance, central pathway, and exit were characterized during the same beat by virtual electrodes and visualized on a three-dimensional map both during sinus rhythm, ongoing VT, and pacemapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis demonstrated an activation of the conductive channel in opposite directions during the sinus rhythm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Late potentials during sinus rhythm turned into mid-diastolic activity during VT; non-contact mapping allowed the ablation procedure to be performed in sinus rhythm, targeting the central pathway of the conducting channel and the abolition of VT inducibility </plain></SENT>
