<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> (Celebrex), a widely prescribed selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, can modulate ion channels independently of cyclooxygenase inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> can affect ionic currents and alter functioning of neurons and myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, inhibition of Kv2.1 channels by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> leads to arrhythmic beating of Drosophila heart and of rat heart cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the spectrum of ion channels involved in human cardiac excitability differs from that in animal models, including mammalian models, making it difficult to evaluate the relevance of these observations to humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to examine the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> on hERG and other human channels critically involved in regulating human cardiac rhythm, and to explore the mechanisms of any observed effect on the hERG channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> inhibited the hERG, SCN5A, KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/MinK channels expressed in HEK-293 cells with IC(50)s of 6.0 µM, 7.5 µM, 3.5 µM and 3.7 µM respectively, and the KCND3/KChiP2 channels expressed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells with an IC(50) of 10.6 µM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>'s effects on hERG channels suggested gating modification as the mechanism of drug action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The above channels play a significant role in drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001657'>long QT syndrome</z:hpo> (LQTS) and short QT syndrome (SQTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regulatory guidelines require that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new drugs under development be tested for effects on the hERG channel prior to first administration in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations raise the question of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>'s potential to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> or other channel related adverse effects, and make a case for examining such possibilities </plain></SENT>
