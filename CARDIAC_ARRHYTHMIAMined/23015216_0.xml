<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Effective intraprocedural anticoagulation for catheter ablation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> is critical to minimize the risk of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of dabigatran on anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during the procedure is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compares <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation in patients treated with dabigatran vs. patients on uninterrupted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six consecutive patients (24 dabigatran and 52 warfarin) subjected to a standard intraprocedural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> protocol were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> administration and rapidity and degree of anticoagulation were compared between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite greater administration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (52.5 ± 22.0 vs. 33.2 ± 10.1 units kg(-1) h(-1); p &lt; 0.001), the mean (320.3 ± 19.5 s) and peak (358.8 ± 28.6 s) activated clotting time (ACT) for the dabigatran group were significantly lower than for the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group (mean, 362.9 ± 35.9 and peak, 410.4 ± 49.7; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time from initial <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> bolus to first ACT of ≥300 s in the dabigatran group was more than twice that observed in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> group (45.0 ± 30.4 vs. 20.9 ± 14.5 min; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time to first ACT of ≥350 s was similarly prolonged (109.1 ± 60.0 vs. 55.2 ± 51.1 min; p &lt; 0.001) in the dabigatran group, with eight patients (33 %) failing to reach this target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome differences persisted following analysis using linear models and Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for propensity scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A standard intraprocedural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> protocol results in delayed and lower levels of anticoagulation as measured by the ACT for patients treated with dabigatran compared with those on uninterrupted <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
