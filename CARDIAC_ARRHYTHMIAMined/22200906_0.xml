<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>-induced alterations in cardiac E-cadherin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi>) after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and an <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> group intraperitoneally received <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> at a single dose of 15 mg/kg for 7 days; the controls received the same amount of saline via the same route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On Day 8, the rats were anesthetized, and a thoracotomy was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate protein expression of E-cadherin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections were analyzed by digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiac protein expression of E-cadherin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> was altered after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>â€‘induced toxicity in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of E-cadherin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> were significantly decreased after <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> treatment, supported by IOD analysis, when compared with the control (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The current findings indicate that such changes would be reflected in abnormal cardiac function, and these proteins may be useful for revealing the mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>-induced toxicity and may also provide various clues for further research </plain></SENT>
