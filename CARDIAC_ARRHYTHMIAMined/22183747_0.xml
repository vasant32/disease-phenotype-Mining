<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the feasibility of delivering β-radiation via a deflectable transvenous catheter has been described, dose effects and the time course of histopathological changes have not been previously assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize pathological aspects of cardiac lesions induced by β-radiation in an animal model at various stages of evolution and in response to different dose exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine dogs and one pig were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cavotricuspid isthmus, antrum of pulmonary veins (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>), and mitral isthmus were irradiated (25, 50, 75, or 100 Gy) with <z:chebi fb="19" ids="33324">strontium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi>-90, delivered via a deflectable catheter (cavotricuspid isthmus and mitral isthmus) or a double-loop catheter (antrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen lesions were created </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions were processed for morphometric histopathological analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the first month, lesions were characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, haemorrhage, and myocyte <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, fibrotic replacement was predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transmurality of lesions was observed in 50% of cases, with no dose-response effect (P = 0.976) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surface fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was present in 50% of cases and was essentially limited to lesions assessed within the first month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No neighbouring injury or pulmonary venous stenosis was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atrial lesions created by β-radiation are characterized by an inflammatory phase with surface fibrin <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during the first month and replacement <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No appreciable dose-response effect was noted within the 25-100 Gy range tested </plain></SENT>
