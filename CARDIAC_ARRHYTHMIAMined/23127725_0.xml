<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting RSA was calculated from respiration and heart rate data collected during a neutral film; <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo> was measured using parents', preschool teachers', and classroom observers' reports; and EC was measured using four laboratory tasks in addition to questionnaire measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Principal components analysis was used to create composite measures of EC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relation between RSA and EC was moderated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo>, such that RSA was positively related to EC only for children high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This interaction suggests that emotional reactivity affects the degree to which RSA can be considered a correlate of EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study also draws attention to the need to consider the measurement context when assessing resting psychophysiology measures; shy individuals may not exhibit true baseline RSA responding in an unfamiliar laboratory setting </plain></SENT>
