<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:mp ids='MP_0006048'>pulmonary regurgitation</z:mp> (PR) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> (TOF) repair could result in RV dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate the mid-term clinical outcomes of PVR after TOF repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2001 and 2010, we retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 131 (89 males and 42 females) PVRs with PR or pulmonary steno-insufficiency after TOF repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVR was performed at a mean age of 14.8±6.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean interval from total correction of TOF to PVR was 12.5±5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications of PVR were more than moderate PR with/without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001642'>pulmonary stenosis</z:hpo>, right ventricle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, right ventricle dysfunction and reduced exercise capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hancock II (n=58), Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> Perimount (n=49) and St Jude Biocor (n=35) bioprosthetic valves were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean z-score at implantation was 1.1±0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean valve size implanted was 25.1±1.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no early or late mortality in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices (from 111.3±34.7 to 64.6±23.6, P&lt;0.01) (preoperative n=70, postoperative n=17) were markedly decreased PVR during the 13.2±16.1 months follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (male=10, female=1) required a repeat PVR operation due to prosthetic valve failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rate of freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 66.4±4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Implanted valve type (Carpentier-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Edwards</z:e> bovine valve), young age, and large-sized valve implantation (z-score&gt;2.0) were risk factors for a repeat PVR in the univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no risk factor in the multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PVR reduced the RV volume and improved the RV function within the first postoperative year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The rate of freedom from reoperation during the 10-year follow-up period in our series was acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, a longer follow-up will be necessary to determine the long-term outcomes of bioprosthetic valves in PVR </plain></SENT>
