<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty mechanically ventilated patients with circulatory insufficiency in whom volume expansion was planned by attending physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included spontaneous respiratory activity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, known intracardiac shunt, severe hypoxemia (Pao2/Fio2 &lt;100 mm Hg), contraindication for passive leg raising, left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;50%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Fluid challenge with 500 mL of 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl-<z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi> if respiratory variations in arterial pulse pressure were ≥ 13% or with passive leg raising if variations in arterial pulse pressure were &lt;13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pleth variability index, variations in arterial pulse pressure, and cardiac output estimated by echocardiography were recorded before and after fluid challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output of ≥ 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were responders and 19 were nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean ± sd pleth variability index (28% ± 13% vs. 11% ± 4%) and arterial pulse pressure variation (22% ± 11% vs. 5% ± 2%) values at baseline were significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pleth variability index threshold value of 17% allowed discrimination between responders and nonresponders with a sensitivity of 95% (95% confidence interval, 74% to 100%) and a specificity of 91% (95% confidence interval, 70% to 99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pleth variability index at baseline correlated (r = .72, p &lt; .0001) with the percentage change in cardiac output induced by fluid challenge, suggesting that a higher pleth variability index at baseline will correlate with a higher percentage change in cardiac output after volume expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pleth variability index can predict fluid responsiveness noninvasively in intensive care unit patients under mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
