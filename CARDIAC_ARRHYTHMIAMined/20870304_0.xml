<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Contrast media (CM) exposure is associated with a substantial risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and nephrotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These adverse effects may be exacerbated in high-risk conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, although no studies have evaluated newer CM agents in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the electrophysiologic and renal effects of two newer CM agents, iodixanol and ioxilan, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients undergoing angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients who received either iso-osmolar iodixanol (n=44) or low-osmolar ioxilan (n=43), stratified for concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>, were evaluated for QT interval and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> changes in comparison to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QT values were corrected according to three formulae: Bazett's correction, Fridericia formula, and Framingham equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics were not significantly different in the iodixanol versus ioxilan groups, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant change in mean QTc was observed after exposure to either CM agent compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results were unaffected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> from baseline was observed in the iodixanol group compared to the ioxilan group (-0.121 ± 0.35 mg/dL vs. 0.033 ± 0.23 mg/dL, respectively; p=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No significant change in QTc interval was observed in patients receiving either iodixanol or ioxilan during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Iodixanol appeared to improve short-term renal function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and should be further investigated </plain></SENT>
