<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently available anti-AF drugs are limited by only moderate efficacy and an unfavorable safety profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a recognized need for improved antiarrhythmic agents with actions that are selective for the fibrillating atrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>State-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-channel blockade potentially allows for the development of drugs with maximal actions on fibrillating atrial tissue and minimal actions on ventricular tissue at resting heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied a mathematical model of state-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-channel blocking (class I antiarrhythmic drug) action, along with mathematical models of canine atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte action potentials, AF, and ventricular proarrhythmia, to determine the relationship between their pharmacodynamic properties and atrial-selectivity, AF-selectivity (atrial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-channel block at AF rates versus ventricular block at resting rates), AF-termination effectiveness, and ventricular proarrhythmic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that drugs that target inactivated channels are AF-selective, whereas drugs that target activated channels are not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most AF-selective drugs were associated with minimal ventricular proarrhythmic potential and terminated AF in 33% of simulations; slightly fewer AF-selective agents achieved termination rates of 100% with low ventricular proarrhythmic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results define properties associated with AF-selective actions of class-I antiarrhythmic drugs and support the idea that it may be possible to develop class I antiarrhythmic agents with optimized pharmacodynamic properties for AF treatment </plain></SENT>
