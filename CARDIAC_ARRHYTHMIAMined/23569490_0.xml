<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite its anti-arrhythmic properties, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> is associated with side effects such as thyroid dysfunction, <z:mp ids='MP_0005544'>corneal deposits</z:mp>, bluish skin discoloration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> and pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">Amiodarone</z:chebi> induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is one of the most serious side effect thus limiting its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We encountered a 66 year old male with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AIPT who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and chest imaging revealed extensive ground-glass opacities throughout lung parenchyma with rapid resolution of these opacities in a week following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There have been few case reports of AIPT with complete resolution of ground glass opacities on treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, but none demonstrated a rapid response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heath care providers should withdraw <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> at the earliest suspicion (as illustrated in our case); any delay can potentially be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case highlights the fact that AIPT is a reversible phenomenon, provided its early recognition and treatment before <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> sets in This case also highlights the need to include AIPT in the differential diagnosis in any patient on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> who presents with <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
