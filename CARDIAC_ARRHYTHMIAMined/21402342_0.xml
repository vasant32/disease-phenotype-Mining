<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between sex hormones and idiopathic outflow tract <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> (IOTVA), and the effect of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy on IOTVA, in postmenopausal female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma <z:chebi fb="25" ids="50112">sex hormone</z:chebi> concentrations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> counts were estimated in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA and control postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy on IOTVA was observed in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA was significantly lower than that in control postmenopausal women (8.4 ± 3.4 vs 36.9 ± 12.8pg/mL, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> count in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA was significantly higher than that in controls (10,171 ± 6091 vs 209 ± 468 counts/24 hours, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 3 months of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> count was significantly lower than that before therapy (3958 ± 1972 vs 10171 ± 6091 counts/24 hours, respectively; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> was lower in postmenopausal patients with IOTVA than in control postmenopausal women, and that <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy can inhibit effectively the genesis of IOTVA </plain></SENT>
