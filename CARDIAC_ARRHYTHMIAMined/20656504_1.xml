<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare the detection rate of AF using continuous cardiac telemetry (CCT) versus Holter monitoring in hospitalized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between June 2007 and December 2008, 133 patients were admitted to an academic institution for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and underwent concurrent inpatient CCT and Holter monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of AF detection by CCT and Holter monitoring were compared using the McNemar paired proportion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 133 patients, 8 (6.0%) were diagnosed with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On average, Holter monitoring was performed for 29.8 hours, and CCT was performed for 73.6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of AF detection was higher for Holter monitoring compared with CCT (6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-11.6 vs 0; 95% CI, 0-3.4; P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Holter detection of AF was even higher in specific subgroups (those with an embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern, those age &gt;65 years, and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Holter monitoring detected AF in 6% of hospitalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients, with higher proportions in high-risk subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with CCT, Holter monitoring is significantly more likely to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
