<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These genes are abundantly expressed in striated muscle tissue, however their function is not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated the role of the popdc2 gene in zebrafish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Popdc2 transcripts were detected in the embryonic myocardium and transiently in the craniofacial and tail musculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of popdc2 resulted in aberrant development of skeletal muscle and heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle segments in the trunk were irregularly shaped and craniofacial muscles were severely reduced or even missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the heart, pericardial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was prevalent in the morphants and heart chambers were elongated and looping was abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These pathologies in muscle and heart were alleviated after reducing the morpholino concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However the heart still was abnormal displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> at later stages of development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optical recordings of cardiac contractility revealed irregular ventricular contractions with a 2:1, or 3:1 atrial/ventricular conduction ratio, which caused a significant reduction in heart frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recordings of calcium transients with high spatiotemporal resolution using a transgenic calcium indicator line (Tg(cmlc2:gCaMP)(s878)) and SPIM microscopy confirmed the presence of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results identify popdc2 as a gene important for striated muscle differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition it is required for the development of the cardiac conduction system </plain></SENT>
