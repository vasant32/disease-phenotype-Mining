<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with MRSA require different empiric treatment than those with non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0343401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">MRSA infections</z:e>, yet no accurate tools exist to aid in stratifying the risk for a MRSA cSSSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to develop a simple bedside decision rule to tailor empiric coverage more accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a large multicenter (N=62 hospitals) retrospective cohort study in a US-based database between April 2005 and March 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult initial admissions with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM codes specific to cSSSI were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients admitted with MRSA vs. non-MRSA were compared with regard to baseline demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We developed and validated a model to predict the risk of MRSA, and compared its performance via sensitivity, specificity and other classification statistics to the healthcare-associated (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e>) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 7,183 patients with cSSSI, 2,387 (33.2%) had MRSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors discriminating MRSA from non-MRSA were age, African-American race, no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, and prior history of cardiac dysrhythmia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The score ranging from 0 to 8 points exhibited a consistent dose-response relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A MRSA score of 5 or higher was superior to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> classification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> characteristics, while that of 4 or higher was superior on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metrics except specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRSA is present in 1/3 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hospitalized cSSSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A simple bedside risk score can help discriminate the risk for MRSA vs. other pathogens with improved accuracy compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HCA</z:e> definition </plain></SENT>
