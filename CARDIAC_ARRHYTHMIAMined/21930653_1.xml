<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) has proved effective in curing highly symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to identify the optimal treatment of patients with AF recurrences after the first ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-six patients with paroxysmal AF underwent ablation (circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with linear lesions) and were monitored with an implantable cardiac monitor (Reveal XT, Medtronic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients without AF recurrences during the 3-month postablation period were assigned to group 1; those with AF recurrences to group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 were randomly assigned to group 3 or group 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 3 patients were treated only with antiarrhythmic drugs for 6 weeks, with no early reablation during the 3-month postablation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of AF recurrence after the 3-month postablation period, patients underwent reablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group 4 patients were treated according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> mechanism of AF recurrences, as detected and stored by the implantable cardiac monitor: antiarrhythmic drug therapy, but no reablation if AF was not preceded by triggers; early reablation if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">premature atrial beats</z:e> or atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> or flutter triggered AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for 1 year to assess maintenance of sinus rhythm in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On 12-month follow-up examination, of the 119 (42%) patients in group 1, 112 (94%) had no AF recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 83 patients in group 3, only 27 (33%) had no recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 84 group 4 patients, 67 (80%) had no AF recurrences (P&lt;0.0001 versus group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recurrences after the first AF ablation are likely to respond to a second early ablation when AF is triggered by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> or premature contractions </plain></SENT>
