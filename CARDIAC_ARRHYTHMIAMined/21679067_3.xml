<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety of endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> (CCSVI) in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a 1-year period, 461 MS patients (261 women; mean age 45.4 years, range 21-79) with CCSVI underwent endovascular treatment of 1012 venous lesions during 495 procedures [34 (6.9%) reinterventions] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While balloon angioplasty was preferred, 98 stents were implanted in 76 patients for lesion recoil, restenosis, or suboptimal dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedures were analyzed for incidences of major adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, or clinical deterioration of MS), access site complications, procedure-related complications, and procedural safety-related variables (fluoroscopy and contrast times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complication rates were compared to published data for similar endovascular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events, or clinical deterioration of MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Access site complications included limited groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (5, 1.0%); there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1504542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">puncture site infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systemic complications included only rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> (6, 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications included vein rupture (2, 0.4%), vein dissection (15, 3.0%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in-stent/in-segment <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (8, 1.6%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recoil (1, 0.2%); there was no stent migration or fracture or distal embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean fluoroscopy time was 22.7 minutes, and mean contrast volume was 136.3 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and reliable method for treating CCSVI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Innovations such as purpose-specific materials and devices are needed, as are case-controlled and randomized data to establish efficacy in ameliorating MS symptoms </plain></SENT>
