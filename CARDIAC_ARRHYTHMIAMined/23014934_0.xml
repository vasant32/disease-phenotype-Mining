<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rapid right ventricular pacing in anesthetized dogs results in marked protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previous evidence that this protection associates with altered expression of genes, encoding proteins involved in the delayed cardioprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the sequence of transcriptional changes occurring between the pacing stimulus and the test <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has not yet been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we designed studies in which the expression of 29 genes was examined by real-time PCR at various time intervals, i.e., immediately (0 h), 6, 12, and 24 h after short periods (4 times 5 min) of rapid (240 beats min(-1)) right ventricular pacing in the canine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated dogs (the pacing electrode was introduced but the dogs were not paced) served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with these dogs, pacing induced an early up-regulation of genes which encode, for example, HSP90, MnSOD, ERK1, PKCε, Bcl2, and sGC; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these somehow relate to the early phase of the protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These genes remained either up-regulated or, after a transient lower expression (around 6 h), were up-regulated again, suggesting their involvement in the delayed protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were also some genes which down-regulated soon after the pacing stimulus (e.g., Bax, Casp3, Casp9, MMP9, GSK3β), and showed also low expression 24 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes encoding eNOS and iNOS, as well as Cx43 were only up-regulated 12 h after pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cardiac pacing induces time-dependent changes in gene expression, and the sequence of these changes is important in the development of the delayed protection </plain></SENT>
