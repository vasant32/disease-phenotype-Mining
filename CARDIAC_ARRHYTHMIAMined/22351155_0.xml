<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the essential trace elements zinc, copper, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> are suspected to have an effect on postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, the concentrations of these elements were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the plasma of 60 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected every 30 min during cardiopulmonary bypass and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of copper, zinc, and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> were measured with flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored by continuous electrocardiography until they became outpatients or immediately after <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> had taken place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> occurred in 13 of the 60 patients, corresponding to 21.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The zinc and copper concentrations at postoperative days 1 and 3 were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of zinc following cardiopulmonary bypass recovered more slowly in patients with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> than in patients without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether or not supplemental zinc could lower the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> should be evaluated in future prospective randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
