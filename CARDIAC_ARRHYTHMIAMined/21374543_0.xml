<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excess <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> secretion induces low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels in male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> but no study has yet evaluated if this is accompanied by changes in QT interval duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore decided to evaluate whether male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> present changes in QT interval duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QT interval was measured in electrocardiographic readings from 19 men and 35 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> and age- and sex-matched controls were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QT interval was corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTc) and QTc &gt;440 msec and &gt;460 msec were taken as indicative of increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001664'>torsade de pointes</z:hpo> in men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean QTc was significantly longer in male patients compared with healthy controls (426.9±9.27 vs. 389.7±8.31, p&lt;0.05) and 5 men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> presented prolonged QTc (prevalence 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By comparison, none of the women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> presented prolonged QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>Hypokalemia</z:hpo> and low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> appeared associated with long QTc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> present prolongation of QT interval which may lead to measurements associated with high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both low <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo> appear to contribute to long QT in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010481" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
