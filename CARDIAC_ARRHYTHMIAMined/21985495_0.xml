<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the electrocardiographic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> arising from the right ventricular outflow tract and the particular association between this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and the presence of localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in English bulldogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five English bulldogs were referred with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> or cardiogenic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs, 12-lead surface ECG, thoracic radiograph and echocardiography were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one dog 24-hours Holter monitoring and signal-averaged ECGs was examined and in one dog electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation of the VT substrate was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> included a single sustained monomorphic wide QRS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> in four dogs, and an alternans of two different monomorphic forms in one dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean QRS duration during tachy-cardia was 91·6 ±9·83 milliseconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QRS complexes manifested a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and an inferior axis (81 ±13·73°) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R wave notching was present in the caudal (inferior) leads in three tachy-cardias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lead I was negative in 3 of 6, positive in 1 of 6 and isodiphasic in 2 of 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lead aVL was negative in 5 of 6 and positive in 1 of 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Signal-averaged electrocardiograms revealed late potentials in three dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cardiac map-ping established two sites of origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> within the right ventricular outflow tract in one dog: caudal free-wall and cranial-septal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011713'>left bundle branch block</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> could suggest segmental arrhythmogenic right ven-tricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> in the English bulldog </plain></SENT>
