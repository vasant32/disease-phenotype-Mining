<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As these populations may not truly represent healthy individuals, we assessed morphological abnormalities in ECG in healthy volunteers participating in phase I studies, who are screened to exclude associated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ECGs from 62 phase I studies analyzed in a central ECG laboratory were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single drug-free baseline ECG from each subject was reviewed by experienced cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECG intervals were measured on five consecutive beats and morphological abnormalities identified using standard guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Morphological abnormalities were detected in 25.5 per cent of 3978 healthy volunteers (2495 males, 1483 females; aged 18-76 yr); the presence was higher in males (29.3% vs. 19.2% in females; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rhythm abnormalities were the commonest (11.5%) followed by conduction abnormalities (5.9%), axis deviation (4%), ST-T wave changes (3.1%) and chamber enlargement (1.4%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003896'>Prolonged PR interval</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RBBB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264909" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraventricular conduction defects</z:e> were more common in males while <z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>sinus tachycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005165'>short PR interval</z:hpo> and non-specific T wave changes were more frequent in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: Morphological abnormalities in ECG are commonly seen in healthy volunteers participating in phase I studies; and vary with age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine whether these abnormalities persist or if some of these disappear on follow up </plain></SENT>
