<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Long-term endurance sports are associated with atrial remodeling and an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pro-atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (pro-ANP) is a marker of atrial wall tension and elevated in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that atrial remodeling would be perpetuated by repetitive episodes of atrial stretching during strenuous competitions, reflected by elevated levels of pro-ANP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study was performed on nonelite runners scheduled to participate in the 2010 Grand Prix of Bern, a 10-mile race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hundred ninety-two marathon and nonmarathon runners applied for participation, 70 were randomly selected, and 56 entered the final analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects were stratified according to former marathon participations: a control group (nonmarathon runners, n = 22), group 1 (1 to 4 marathons, n = 16), and group 2 (≥5 marathons, n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were adjusted for age, training years, and average weekly endurance training hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 42 ± 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to the control group, marathon runners in groups 1 and 2 had larger left atria (25 ± 6 vs 30 ± 6 vs 34 ± 7 ml/m(2), p = 0.002) and larger right atria (27 ± 7 vs 31 ± 8 vs 35 ± 5 ml/m(2), p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pro-ANP levels at baseline were higher in marathon runners (1.04 ± 0.38 vs 1.42 ± 0.74 vs 1.67 ± 0.69 nmol/L, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pro-ANP increased significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups after the race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multiple linear regression analysis, marathon participation was an independent predictor of left atrial (β = 0.427, p &lt;0.001) and right atrial (β = 0.395, p = 0.006) remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, marathon running was associated with progressive left and right atrial remodeling, possibly induced by repetitive episodes of atrial stretching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The altered left and right atrial substrate may facilitate atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
