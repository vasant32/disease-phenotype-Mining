<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level it is unclear whether the suppression of cardiac Ca(2+) channels (Ca(V)1.2) results directly from oxygen deprivation on the channel protein or is mediated by intermediary proteins affecting the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this question we measured the early effects of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (5-60 s, P(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) &lt; 5 mmHg) on Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) and tested the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-mediated signalling and the haem oxygenase (HO) pathway in the hypoxic regulation of Ca(V)1.2 in rat and cat ventricular myocytes and HEK-293 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic suppression of ICa) and Ca(2+) transients was significant within 5 s and intensified in the following 50 s, and was reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation by cAMP or the phosphatase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44658">okadaic acid</z:chebi> desensitized I(Ca) to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, while PKA inhibition by H-89 restored the sensitivity of I(Ca) to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This phosphorylation effect was specific to Ca(2+), but not Ba(2+) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>, permeating through the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CaMKII inhibitory <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and Bay K8644 reversed the phosphorylation-induced desensitization to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation of CAM/CaMKII-binding motifs of the Î±(1c) subunit of Ca(V)1.2 fully desensitized the Ca(2+) channel to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rapid application of HO inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28783">zinc protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (ZnPP) and tin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15430">protoporphyrin</z:chebi> (SnPP)) suppressed the channel in a manner similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> such that: (1) I(Ca) and I(Ba) were suppressed within 5 s of ZnPP application; (2) PKA activation and CaMKII inhibitors desensitized I(Ca), but not I(Ba), to ZnPP; and (3) <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> failed to further suppress I(Ca) and I(Ba) in ZnPP-treated myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that the binding of HO to the CaM/CaMKII-specific motifs on Ca(2+) channel may mediate the rapid response of the channel to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
