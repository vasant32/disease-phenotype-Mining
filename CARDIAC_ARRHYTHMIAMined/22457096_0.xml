<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The number of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD) requiring diagnostic and/or therapeutic cardiac catheterization has been increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been few studies on the complications of performing cardiac catheterization in adults with CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of complications during congenital cardiac catheterization in both adults and pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2134 consecutive cardiac catheterizations performed between 2003 and 2008 were prospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications were graded from 1 to 5 based on severity and these, with ≥grade 3 being defined as major </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 576 procedures (393 diagnostic, 90 interventional, and 93 electrophysiological) were performed in adult patients (≥18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> was present in 435 of 576 procedures (75.6 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 65 complications (11.3 %) with 13 major complications including 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (2.3 %) were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of complications were successfully treated or temporary, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the patients were without residua </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 1558 pediatric procedures performed during the same period, we found a total of 229 complications (14.7 %), of which 89 (5.7 %) were major complications including 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The safety of performing cardiac catheterization for adult CHD appears to be similar to that for pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The complication rates in adults with CHD are low, but not negligible </plain></SENT>
