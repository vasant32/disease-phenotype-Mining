<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 14-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>ventricular preexcitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A standard, fluoroscopy guided, ablation procedure was successfully performed in a postero-midseptal region with a total fluoroscopy time of about 45 min (2430 cGy.cm(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A few hours after the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> reappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second ablation procedure was scheduled using the EnSite NavXâ„¢ mapping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During mapping along the tricuspid groove, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004309'>preexcitation</z:hpo> suddenly disappeared due to mechanical "bumping" of the accessory pathway and it did not recover over the next 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As per our routine practice, the phase of geometry reconstruction has been continuously recorded by the system; thus, an off-line analysis allowed to pinpoint the site of earliest activation and the site of mechanical bumping, where radiofrequency obtained the accessory pathway ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second procedure was performed without using fluoroscopy at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thanks to the geometry reconstruction, the procedure was completely successful thus avoiding a further rehospitalization </plain></SENT>
