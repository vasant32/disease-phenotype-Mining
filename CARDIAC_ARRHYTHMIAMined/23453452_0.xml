<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to investigate whether dental scaling can reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In year 2000, a total of 28,909 subjects who were age 60 or more without past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> were identified from the "National Health Insurance Research Database" in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these subjects, those who have received dental scaling at least 1 time/year for 3 consecutive years (1998-2000) were selected to be the exposed group (n=3391) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 13,564 age, sex and underlying disease-matched subjects without receiving dental scaling were identified to be the non-exposed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study endpoint was the occurrence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a follow-up of 4.6Â±1.1years, 478 participants (2.8%) developed AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The exposed group had a lower AF occurrence rate than non-exposed group (2.2% versus 3.0%; p value=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After an adjustment with age, gender, and comorbidities in the multivariate analysis, dental scaling was associated with a reduced risk of AF (hazard ratio=0.671, 95% CI=0.524-0.859; p value=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the exposed group, the hazard ratio in developing AF was 0.340 (95% CI=0.247-0.489; p value &lt;0.001) when subjects received 1 more dental scaling per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of AF was lower in subjects receiving dental scaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement of oral hygiene by dental scaling may be a simple and useful way to prevent AF </plain></SENT>
