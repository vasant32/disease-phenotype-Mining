<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the clinical profile and the surgical outcomes in such a population from Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 1970 and 2009, 179 TOF patients (56% male) received total repair at 19.2 ± 8.3 (10-49) years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical records and interviewed the patients concerning their current status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival was ascertained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> by a link to our national health database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major morbidities before cardiac repair included atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (1.1%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (3.9%), infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (6.7%), brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (4.6%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e> (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>Ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e> occurred mainly after 20 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (16.8%) received a palliative shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preoperative QRS duration increment was 0.6 ms/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early mortality occurred in 4 (2.2%) and was related to previous shunt surgery (OR = 16.5, p &lt; 0.05) and coronary artery crossing RVOT (OR 17.6, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After repair, the functional class improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median age at latest follow-up was 31.8 (32.8 ± 12.3) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival was 92.7 and 89.3% at 20 and 30 years after operation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Late cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be predicted by the length of postoperative intensive care unit stay (OR = 1.3, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> 30 years after repair was 84.1% and was associated with a final QRS longer than 160 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Unrepaired TOF patients were at high risk of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> during their adolescence and adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cardiac repair in this age group was still safe and effective </plain></SENT>
