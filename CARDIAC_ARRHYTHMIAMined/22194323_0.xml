<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied action potentials (APs), the L-type calcium (Ca(2+)) current (I(Ca,L)), and intracellular Ca(2+) transients ([Ca(2+)](i)) of subendocardial (Endo), midmyocardial (Mid), and subepicardial (Epi) tissue layers in the canine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> pacing-induced failing left ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Heart failure</z:hpo> (HF) was associated with significant prolongation of the AP duration in Mid myocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in I(Ca,L) density in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Endo, Mid, and Epi myocytes, whereas in the failing heart, I(Ca,L) density was downregulated by 45% and 26% (at +10 mV) in Endo and Mid myocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rates of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release and decay of the [Ca(2+)](i) were slowed, and the amplitude of the [Ca(2+)](i) was depressed in Endo and Epi myocytes isolated from failing, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>)-free solutions showed that Epi and Mid myocytes of the failing ventricle exhibit a greater reliance on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>-Ca(2+) exchanger to remove cytosolic Ca(2+) than myocytes isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies in Endo, Mid, and Epi canine myocytes demonstrate the importance of L-type current density and SR Ca(2+) uptake in modulating the potentially arrhythmogenic repolarization in HF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results demonstrate that spatially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> decreases in I(Ca,L) and defective cytosolic Ca(2+) removal contribute to the altered [Ca(2+)](i) and AP profiles across the canine failing LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These distinct electrophysiological features in myocytes from a failing heart contribute to a characteristic electrogram arising from increased dispersion of refractoriness across the LV, which may result in significant arrhythmogenic sequellae </plain></SENT>
