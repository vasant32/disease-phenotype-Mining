<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that salusin-α and -β protected cultured cardiomyocytes from serum deprivation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through upregulating <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein whose overexpression acts as a marker and suppressor of ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether salusin-α and -β inhibit ER stress in ischemic myocardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> created by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), salusin-α or -β was intravenously injected at 5 or 15 nmol kg(-1) 15 min prior to 2 h of LAD occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The high dose of salusin-α and -β significantly improved heart function and hemodynamics in LAD-occluded rats, but had no effects in sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> caused by LAD occlusion were markedly attenuated by salusin-α and -β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rate in ischemic myocardium was reduced from 31.5%±3.7% to 19.8%±2.2% and 12.3%±2.2%, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced from 53.4%±4.0% of the risk area to 26.5%±9.7% and 23.7%±8.9% by 15 nmol kg(-1) salusin-α and -β, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, salusin-α and -β prevented the activation of GRP78 and ER stress-specific apoptotic effectors caspase-12 and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and attenuated the reduction of an ER stress-associated antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in ischemic cardiac tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The salusins also inhibited the ER stress induced by tunicamycin in cultured rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that salusins protect myocardium against ischemic injury by inhibiting ER stress and ER stress-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
