<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: For patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF), a curvilinear multi-electrode ablation (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>) catheter has been reported to be successful to achieve pulmonary vein (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this approach has not been compared prospectively with conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation (CPVI) using a standard circular mapping catheter and 3D electro-anatomic mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective non-randomized study, we compared the efficacy of these two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 185 consecutive patients, age 54.6 ± 10.1 years, with symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF), 96 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> isolation by CPVI and 89 patients underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> to isolate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CPVI was performed by encircling the left- and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ablation catheter (Medtronic, USA) was used to isolate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> with duty-cycled radiofrequency energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean procedure time was 171.73 ± 52.87 min for CPVI and 133.25 ± 37.99 min for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi>, respectively (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean fluoroscopy time was 31.07 ± 14.97 for CPVI and 30.07 ± 11.45 min for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> (P = 0.651) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 80% of patients who underwent CPVI and 82% of patients who underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> were free of symptomatic PAF off antiarrhythmic drug therapy (P = 0.989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the variables of age, gender, duration and frequency of PAF, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial size, structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and the ablation technique, only an increased left atrial size was an independent predictor of recurrent PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Left <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> occurred after CPVI in two patients and after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> ablation in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing catheter ablation for PAF, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16000,17141">MEA</z:chebi> and CPVI proved equally efficacious </plain></SENT>
