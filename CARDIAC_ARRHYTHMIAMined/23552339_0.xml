<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Among adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart diseases</z:hpo> (CHD) evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> (SCD) risk remains a great challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although microvolt T-wave alternans has been incorporated into SCD risk stratification algorithm, its role in adults with CHD still requires investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the incidence of MTWA in this specific group and its coincidence with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> (VA) and other clinical findings presumably associated with SCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed in which 102 patients with CHD characterized by right ventricle pathology or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001750'>single ventricle</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004110'>TGA</z:mp>, UVH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010316'>Ebstein's anomaly</z:hpo>, ccTGA, Eisenmenger syndrome, <z:mp ids='MP_0000284'>DORV</z:mp>, CAT, unoperated ToF) were compared to 45 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent spectral MTWA test, ambulatory ecg monitoring, cardiopulmonary test, BNP assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After excluding technically inadequate traces, the remaining MTWA results were classified as positive(+), negative(-) and indeterminate(ind) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to similar prognostic significance MTWA(+) and (ind) were combined into a common group labeled 'abnormal' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal MTWA was present more often in the study group, compared to controls (39.2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (sVT) was observed more often among subjects with abnormal MTWA compared to MTWA(-): 19.4% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with abnormal MTWA had a lower blood saturation (p = 0.047), more often were males (p = 0.031), had higher NYHA class (p = 0.04), worse cardiopulmonary parameters: %PeakVO2 (p = 0.034), %HRmax (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors proven to increase probability of abnormal MTWA on multivariate linear regression analysis were: sVT (OR = 20.7, p = 0.037) and male gender (OR = 15.9, p = 0.001); on univariate analysis: male gender (OR = 2.7, p = 0.021), presence of VA (OR = 2.6, p = 0.049), NYHA &gt; I (OR = 2.06, p = 0.033), %HRmax (OR = 0.94, p = 0.005), %PeakVO2 (OR = 0.97, p = 0.042), VE/VCO2slope (OR = 1.05, p = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal MTWA occurs significantly more often in adults with the chosen forms of CHD than among healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The probability of abnormal MTWA increases in patients with malignant VA, in males and among subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MTWA might be of potential role in risk stratification for SCD in adults with CHD </plain></SENT>
