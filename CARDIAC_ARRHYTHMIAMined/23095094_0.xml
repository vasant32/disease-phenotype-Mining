<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between alterations in white matter integrity and regulation of the ANS in 23 participants who sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and fractional anisotropy values were calculated (DTI-FA) for each hemisphere and lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive and physical exertion tasks were performed while recording an electrocardiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (RSA) decreased more during a verbal fluency task with lower left hemisphere DTI-FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the physical stressor yielded decreases in RSA with lower frontal DTI-FA and higher temporal lobe DTI-FA, p &lt; .05 (perhaps a release effect on the central autonomic network) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decrements in ANS regulation may have functional consequences that alter behavior, as well as potentially increasing the risk for further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
