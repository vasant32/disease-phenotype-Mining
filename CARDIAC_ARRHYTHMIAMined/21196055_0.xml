<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on their prognostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with previous Fontan operation followed at our institution since 1999 were identified from the electronic database and included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics including history of atrial tachyarrhythmias were recorded at the earliest full clinical assessment and patients were followed thereafter for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 98 patients, mean age 31.5 ± 8.9 years, 43.8% male, 31.6% with a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A history of atrial tachyarrhythmia was present at baseline in 60.2% of patients who were older (33.0 ± 8.3 vs 29.1 ± 9.4 years, p=0.002), less likely to have a TCPC (13.5% vs 58.9%, p&lt;0.001), and more symptomatic in terms of NYHA class (51.9% vs 26.7%, p=0.007) compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>-free patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 6.7 years 18 patients died and 64 patients were hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even after adjustment for baseline clinical characteristics, atrial tachyarrhythmia was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (propensity score adjusted HR 9.35, 95% CI: 1.10-79.18, p=0.04, c-statistic 0.88) and composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or hospitalization (propensity score adjusted HR 5.00, 95% CI: 2.47-10.09, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with a Fontan-type operation, the presence of atrial tachyarrhythmias is associated with higher morbidity and mortality at mid-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> targeting intervention may improve clinical outcome needs to be studied in a prospective manner </plain></SENT>
