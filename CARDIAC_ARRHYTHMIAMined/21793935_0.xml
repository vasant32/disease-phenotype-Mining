<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: We present our results with minimally invasive surgical treatment of lone <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (LAF) employing a radiofrequency (RF) source through a bilateral thoracoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2007 and January 2011, 28 consecutive patients (85.7% male, mean age 67.1 ± 9.1 years) with LAF underwent video-assisted bilateral RF ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (50%) had paroxysmal, five (17.8%) persistent, and nine (32.2%) long-persistent LAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed-up according to the Heart Rhythm Society/ European Heart Rhythm Association/European <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>Cardiac Arrhythmia</z:hpo> Society (HRS/EHRA/ECA) and success/failure was reported as suggested by Society of Thoracic Surgeon (STS) guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 27.8 ± 8.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Time-related prevalence of postoperative AF was 4.5% at 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success was much more likely in subjects with paroxysmal (3-year prevalence, 0%) or persistent (3-year prevalence, 0%) than long-standing persistent LAF (3-year prevalence, 8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 36 months the estimated prevalence of antiarrhythmic drugs was 11.3% (8.8 to 13.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were detected during the follow-up period and 36-month prevalence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> use was 15.2% (11.5 to 18.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, no patient underwent electrical cardioversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This approach yielded satisfactory results with a high degree of safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further larger studies are necessary to confirm our findings.  </plain></SENT>
