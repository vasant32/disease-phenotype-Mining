<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence indicates a substantial genetic basis for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, AF is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and the hereditary components responsible for AF remain to be identified in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiac gap junction protein α 5 (GJA5) is specifically expressed in atrial myocytes and is associated with the coordinated electrical activation of the atria, providing a rationale to screen GJA5 as a logical candidate gene for AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 310 unrelated patients with lone AF and their available relatives were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A group of 200 unrelated healthy individuals matched for age, gender and race were also included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The entire coding region and splice sites of the GJA5 gene were initially sequenced in 310 unrelated AF patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relatives of mutation carriers and 200 controls were subsequently genotyped for the presence of identified mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result, 4 novel heterozygous GJA5 mutations, p.K107R, p.L223M, p.Q236H and p.I257L, were identified in 4 of 310 unrelated AF patients, respectively, with a prevalence of ~1.29% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of the carriers' families showed that in each family the missense mutation was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Absent in the 400 reference alleles, these mutations altered the amino acids highly conserved among various species, with the exception of p.I257L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study expands the spectrum of GJA5 mutations associated with AF and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of AF, suggesting potential implications for the improved, gene-specific rhythm control strategies </plain></SENT>
