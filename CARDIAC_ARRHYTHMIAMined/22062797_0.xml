<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Improvement in outcome of infants born with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defects</z:hpo> has been accompanied by an increasing frequency of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ablation is difficult because of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> in the presence of complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> with limited accessibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on remote-controlled ablation using magnetic navigation in conjunction with 3D image integration in patients with previous intra-atrial baffle procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen patients (8 male; age, 30.5Â±8 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004755'>supraventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>) underwent catheter ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group A had a medical history of a Mustard or Senning operation, whereas group B had undergone total cavopulmonary connection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardias</z:hpo> were treated in 17 procedures (median cycle length of 280 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A patients had more inducible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> than group B, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> index <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> were located in the remainder of the morphological right atrium in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrograde access through the aorta was performed and led to successful ablation, using magnetic navigation with a very low total radiation exposure (median of 3.8 minutes in group A versus 5.9 minutes in group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of 13 patients continued to have short-lasting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e> despite 3 ablation procedures during a median follow-up time of &gt;200 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remote-controlled catheter ablation by magnetic navigation in combination with accurate 3D image integration allowed safe and successful elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVTs</z:e>, using an exclusively retrograde approach, resulting in low radiation exposure for patients after intra-atrial baffle procedures (Mustard, Senning, or total cavopulmonary connection) </plain></SENT>
