<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to elucidate a plausible pathogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> mechanism for the combined novel mutations R800L-SCN5A and A261V-SNTA1 on cardiac <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A Caucasian family with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and marginally <z:mp ids='MP_0003233'>prolonged QT interval</z:mp> was screened for LQTS-susceptibility genes and found to harbor the R800L mutation in SCN5A and A261V mutation in SNTA1, and those with both mutations had the strongest clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutations were engineered into the most common splice variant of human SCN5A and SNTA1 cDNA, respectively, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> current (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi>) was characterized in human embryonic kidney 293 cells cotransfected with neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (nNOS) and the cardiac isoform of the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA4b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> densities were unchanged for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and for mutant channels containing R800L-SCN5A, A261V-SNTA1, or R800L-SCN5A plus A261V-SNTA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, late <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> for either single mutant was moderately increased two- to threefold compared with WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined mutations of R800L-SCN5A plus A261V-SNTA1 significantly enhanced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33167">INa</z:chebi> late/peak ratio by 5.6-fold compared with WT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time constants of current decay of combined mutant channel were markedly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gain-of-function effect could be blocked by the N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine, a nNOS inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that novel mutations in SCN5A and SNTA1 jointly exert a nNOS-dependent gain-of-function on SCN5A channels, which may consequently prolong the action potential duration and lead to LQTS phenotype </plain></SENT>
