<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to determine electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> and determine their prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients (mean age 36.5 ± 11 years (44 males)) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> and without prior cardiovascular comorbidites were prospectively enrolled and subjected to clinical, laboratory and radiological investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ECG and echocardiography was done at admission and during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients (32.7%) had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and 35 (67.3%) patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011703'>Sinus tachycardia</z:hpo> was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormality</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>QTc prolongation was seen in 30/52 (57.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On echocardiography, no patient had systolic dysfunction but 31/52 (59.6%) patients had diastolic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 22 patients with QTc interval &lt; 440 ms survived compared with 8/30 patients with QTc interval ≥ 440 ms who died (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients who died had evidence of diastolic dysfunction (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients without diastolic dysfunction succumbed to illness (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>Pericardial effusion</z:hpo> was present in 6/52 (11.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients who died, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> was present in three (37.5%) patients and this frequency was significantly higher than that in patients who recovered (3/44 [6.8%]; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic changes are seen in more than 50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001735'>acute pancreatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005184'>Prolonged QTc interval</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> and diastolic dysfunction are associated with higher mortality </plain></SENT>
