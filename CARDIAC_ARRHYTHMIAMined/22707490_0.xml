<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, several studies were published with failure rates between 1.3 and 3.75%/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they included a very high percentage of active fixation leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data in a population with passive leads are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 166 patients who received a Fidelis lead between December 2004 and October 2007 in two teaching hospitals were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We excluded nine patients with incomplete data and 18 with active fixation leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study population thus consists of 139 patients with passive leads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pacing and high-voltage impedance values were systematically collected at implant and in intervals of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 49 ± 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> leads were 6948 models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During a follow-up of 41 ± 15 months, nine leads (6.5%) failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Annual failure rate was 1.9%/year (95% CI 0.4-4.2), cumulative 5-year survival 95.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between leads used in resynchronization and non-resynchronization devices (8.9 and 5.3%, P value 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a population with only passive leads, the Fidelis lead exhibited an impaired long-term survival, but performance was better than in previous studies in which &gt;90% of leads were active models </plain></SENT>
