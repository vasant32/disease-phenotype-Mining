<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Among a larger series of patients (68) with drug-refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who underwent CA in our department, 52 patients were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had a multislice cardiac computed tomography (MSCT) before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated their MSCT scans focusing our attention on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ovality and orientation in the frontal plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A fair inverse association was documented between the ovality index of the left <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> and the degree of occlusion (r=-0.486 and P&lt;0.003 for the LSPV and r=-0.360 and P=0.033 for the LIPV), whereas no association was found between the ovality index of the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PVs</z:e> and the degree of occlusion (r=-0.283 and P=0.083 for the RSPV and r=0.235 and P=0.093 for RIPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a strong inverse association was found between the orientation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> ostia and the degree of occlusion in each vein (r=-0.804 and P&lt;0.001 for the LSPV, r=-0.415 and P=0.013 for LIPV, r=-0.798 and P&lt;0.001 for the RSPV, and r=-0.867 and P&lt;0.001 for RIPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulmonary vein ostium shape and orientation evaluated by MSCT proved to be useful in predicting the degree of occlusion obtained during CA </plain></SENT>
