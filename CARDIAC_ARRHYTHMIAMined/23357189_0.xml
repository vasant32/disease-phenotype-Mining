<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) in isolated female rat hearts in each stage of the estrous cycle that corresponds with a different endogenous reproductive hormonal environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hearts were isolated from female rats under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia and perfused with modified Krebs solution containing 3mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments were grouped according to estrous cycle stage that was determined by prior vaginal lavage (n=10-13 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of male rat hearts was used as the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by coronary ligation and maintained for 30min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was determined from the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in male hearts was 100%, while the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in female hearts was also high but varied moderately with stage of the estrous cycle (diestrus 70%, metestrus 100%, proestrus 90%, estrus 69%; P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared to male hearts, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups except for hearts excised from rats in proestrus, in which it was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between groups in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> score, ischemic zone size, or baseline electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In conclusion, the susceptibility of isolated female rat hearts to ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> is comparable to that of male rat hearts, meaning that isolated female rat hearts can be used as controls in studies to assess antiarrhythmic drug efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since female rats can be used for isolated heart studies of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>, the need to cull female rats is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> susceptibility in female rat hearts that is associated with the different stages of the estrous cycle may affect statistical power that could potentially lead to Type II statistical errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This problem can be prevented with careful randomization </plain></SENT>
