<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective comprehensive study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes with possible correlations between them in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From December 2009 to January 2011, patients admitted with ST-segment elevation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' demographic data, drug history, prehospital delay, door-to-needle or door-to-balloon interval (time to order), type of intervention, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, hemodynamic parameters, Framingham risk score, electrocardiogram findings and laboratory data were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also the length of patients' hospitalization and in-hospital outcome were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlations between patients' baseline clinical data and in-hospital outcomes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 167 patients with a median age (range) of 61 (29-92) years were enrolled in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients' prehospital delay had the median (range) of 3 (0.5-48) h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight (52.7%) patients received streptokinase, for whom the median (range) of door-to-needle time was 30 (6-330) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The door-to-balloon median (range) time of 44 (26.4%) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was 30 (60-300) min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (20.9%) patients were not eligible for thrombolysis or PCI due to late arrival (delay of more than 12 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were significant relationships between older ages of patients and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (P = 0.027), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P = 0.009) and consuming cardiovascular (P = 0.002) agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, younger individuals [odds ratio (OR) 0.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.003-0.069] and those reperfused with primary PCI (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.39-0.47) had significantly shorter hospital stays (discharged within a week) </plain></SENT>
