<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results concerning the response rates of different drugs, respectively, in daily clinical practice and data with regard to the parameters associated with successful cardioversion are not very prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three-hundred seventy-six patients who were admitted to the emergency department with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AF and a duration of shorter than 48 hours were enrolled into the AF registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most effective drugs were flecainide and ibutilide (95% and 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low response rates were observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> (36%) and the individual use of digoxin or diltiazem (19% and 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a successful cardioversion were a lower blood pressure on admission (P = .002), a shorter time interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AF and admission to the ED (P = .003), and adherence to treatment guidelines (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of flecainide and ibutilide is associated with a much higher rate of cardioversion than other drugs we studied </plain></SENT>
