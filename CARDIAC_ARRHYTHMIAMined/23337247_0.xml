<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rabbit left ventricular arterially-perfused-wedge was used to investigate whether the simple iCEB measured from the ECG is reflective of the more difficult measurement of λ (effective refractory period×conduction velocity) for predicting CAs induced by a number of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">Dofetilide</z:chebi> concentration-dependently increased iCEB and λ, predicting potential risk of drug-induced incidence of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) starting at 0.01μM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digoxin (1 and 5μM), encainide (5 and 20μM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> (10 and 100μM) markedly reduced both iCEB and λ, predicting their ability to induce non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 10μM, both NS1643 and levcromakalim significantly decreased λ and iCEB, which was preceded with presence of non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoprenaline</z:chebi> (0.05 to 0.5μM) significantly reduced both λ and iCEB, which was associated with a high incidence of non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in most preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other biomarkers (i.e. transmural dispersion of T-wave and instability of the QT interval) predicted only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4681">dofetilide</z:chebi>-induced long QT and EADs, but did not predict drug-induced risk of non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our data from 7 reference drugs of known pro-arrhythmic effects suggests that 1) this non-invasive iCEB predicts potential risk of drug-induced CAs beyond long QT and TdP; 2) iCEB is more useful than the current biomarkers (i.e. transmural dispersion and instability) in predicting potential risks for drug-induced non-TdP-like VT/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
