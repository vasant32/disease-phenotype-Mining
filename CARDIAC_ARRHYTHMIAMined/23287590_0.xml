<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few studies, however, have evaluated the impact of PAF on early and mid-term outcomes after concomitant aortic valve replacement and coronary aortic bypass graft (AVR-CABG) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS Data obtained prospectively between June 2001 and December 2009 by the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database Program was retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent concomitant atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> surgery/ablation were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and operative data were compared between patients undergoing concomitant AVR-CABG who presented with PAF and those who did not using chi-square and t-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent impact of PAF on 12 short-term complications and mid-term mortality was determined using binary logistic and Cox regression, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS Concomitant AVR-CABG surgery was performed in 2563 patients; 322 (12.6%) presented with PAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PAF patients were generally older (mean age 76 vs 74 years; P &lt; 0.001) and presented more often with comorbidities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PAF was associated with 30-day mortality on univariate analysis (P = 0.019) but not multivariate analysis (P = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of early complications was not significantly higher in the PAF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PAF was independently associated with reduced mid-term survival (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14-2.19; P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS PAF is associated with reduced mid-term survival after concomitant AVR-CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with PAF undergoing AVR-CABG should be considered for a concomitant surgical ablation procedure </plain></SENT>
