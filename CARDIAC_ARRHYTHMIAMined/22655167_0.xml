<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> esophageal temperature (LET) at the time of delivery of energy for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included a total of 110 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> who underwent their first PVI procedure in our laboratory between March 2010 and February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LET was monitored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the number of times that LET reached the cut-off temperature, the time when LET reached the cut-off temperature, the maximum temperature (T max) of the LET, and the time to return to the original pre-energy delivery temperature once the delivery of energy was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients reached the cut-off temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It took 6 s at the shortest time for the LET to reach the cut-off temperature, and 216.5 Â± 102.9 s for the temperature to return to the level before the delivery of energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some patients experienced a transient drop in the LET (TDLET) just before energy delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ablation at these sites always produced a rise to the LET cut-off temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TDLET was not observed at sites where the LET did not rise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the TDLET before the energy delivery was useful to distinguish a high risk of esophageal injury before delivery of energy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sites with a TDLET before energy delivery should be ablated with great caution or, perhaps, not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
