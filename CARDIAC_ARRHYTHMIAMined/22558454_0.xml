<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We generated the antibody directed against one <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of human Kv1.3 (hKv1.3) extracellular loop as a novel and possible Kv1.3 blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of hKv1.3 extracellular loop E3 containing 14 amino acids (E314) was chosen as an antigenic determinant to generate the E314 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The E314 antibody specifically recognized 63.8KD protein stably expressed in hKv1.3-HEK 293 cell lines, whereas it did not recognize or cross-react to human Kv1.1(hKv1.1), Kv1.2(hKv1.2), Kv1.4(hKv1.4), Kv1.5(hKv1.5), KCa3.1(hKCa3.1), HERG, hKCNQ1/hKCNE1, Nav1.5 and Cav1.2 proteins stably expressed in HEK 293 cell lines or in human atrial or ventricular myocytes by Western blotting analysis and immunostaining detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By the technique of whole-cell patch clamp, the E314 antibody was shown to have a directly inhibitory effect on hKv1.3 currents expressed in HEK 293 or Jurkat T cells and the inhibition showed a concentration-dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it exerted no significant difference on hKv1.1, hKv1.2, hKv1.4, hKv1.5, hKCa3.1, HERG, hKCNQ1/hKCNE1, L-type Ca(2+) or voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that the antibody targeting the E314 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of hKv1.3 pore region could be a novel, potent and specific hKv1.3 blocker without affecting a variety of closely related K(v)1 channels, KCa3.1 channels and functional cardiac ion channels underlying central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) disorders or drug-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, which is required as a safe clinic-promising channel blocker </plain></SENT>
