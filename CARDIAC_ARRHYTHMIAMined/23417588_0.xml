<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between ECG changes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>), troponin elevations perioperatively and cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven orthopaedic patients over 60 years of age were prospectively tested for troponin I and ECGs were performed on the fi rst 3 postoperative mornings or until discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidences of pre- and postoperative troponin elevation were 15.5% and 37.4% respectively, the majority were asymptomatically detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients who sustained a troponin rise did not have any concomitant ECG changes (51/70 or 72.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative ECG changes were noted in 18.4% (34/185) and of those with ECG changes, slightly more than half (55.9%) had a troponin elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most ECG changes occurred on postoperative day 1 and were non-ST elevation in type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECG changes occurred more frequently with higher troponin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative troponin elevation (P = 0.018) and not preoperative troponin level (P = 0.060) was associated with ECG changes on univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two premorbid factors were predictors of postoperative ECG changes using multivariate logistical regression; age [odds ratio (OR), 1.05; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.100, P = 0.029) and sex OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.069 to 5.446, P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients sustained postoperative cardiac complications; 9 (45%) were associated with ECG changes and 16 (80%) with postoperative troponin elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre- or postoperative troponin elevation better predicted cardiac complications compared with preoperative ECG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electrocardiograph changes do not necessarily accompany troponin elevations after the emergency orthopaedic surgery but are more likely to have higher troponin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of postoperative cardiac complications is troponin elevation </plain></SENT>
