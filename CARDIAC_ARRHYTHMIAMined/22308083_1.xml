<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were acquired in 53 patients with either persistent (N= 20) or long-standing AF (N= 33), the latter including both long-standing persistent and permanent AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combined frequency analysis of multiple ECG leads followed by the computation of standard complexity measures provided a method for the quantification of spatiotemporal AF organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> possible pairs of precordial ECG leads were analysed by this method and resulting organization measures were used for automatic classification of persistent and long-standing AF signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correct classification rates of 84.9% were obtained, with a predictive value for long-standing AF of 93.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatiotemporal organization as measured in lateral precordial leads V5 and V6 was shown to be significantly lower during long-standing AF than persistent AF, suggesting that time-related alterations in left atrial electrical activity can be detected in the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Accurate discrimination between persistent and long-standing AF based on standard surface recordings was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This information could contribute to optimize the management of sustained AF, permitting appropriate therapeutic decisions and thereby providing substantial clinical cost savings </plain></SENT>
