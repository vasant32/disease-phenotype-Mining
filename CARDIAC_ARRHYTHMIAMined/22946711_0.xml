<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ablation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004756'>ventricular tachycardia</z:hpo> (VT) in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) is challenging and not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes our experience with endocardial VT ablation in six patients with an LVAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of LVAD patients who underwent an ablation procedure for refractory VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of eight ablation procedures were performed in six patients who, during the last 2 weeks before the ablation procedure, received a total of 101 appropriate shocks for VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A closed aortic valve (n = 2) or aortic atheroma (n = 1) required a transseptal catheterization in three of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apical LVAD cannula served as a VT substrate in two of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VT was eliminated in four patients and markedly reduced in two others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter two patients experienced a total of only four implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>) shocks during a follow-up of 130 and 493 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous antiarrhythmic medications used in five of six patients before ablation were discontinued in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ablation procedures permitted hospital discharge in four of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients died during follow-up (228 Â± 207 days after the procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient is still alive 1,205 days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ablation of VT in LVAD patients is feasible and can result in a markedly decreased VT burden with a reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> shocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The subsequent discontinuation of intravenous antiarrhythmic medications may facilitate hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
