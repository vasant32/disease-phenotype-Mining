<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION:: Abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether the decrease in ABI over time carries the prognostic value is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess whether the decrease in ABI over time was a good predictor of poor cardiovascular (CV) prognosis in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: This study enrolled 234 routine hemodialysis patients and 173 patients completed the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ABI was measured by an ABI-form device at baseline and at the first year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ΔABI was defined as ABI measured at the first year follow-up minus ABI measured at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progressors of ABI were defined as patients with ΔABI &lt; -0.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CV events were defined as CV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, hospitalization for unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The follow-up period was 37.8 ± 11.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, progressors of ABI (hazard ratio, 2.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.68, P = 0.03), decreased albumin and increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were associated with increased CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: This longitudinal study showed ΔABI &lt; -0.3 was independently associated with an increase in CV events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, a great decrease in ABI over time might be a useful indicator of poor CV prognosis in hemodialysis patients </plain></SENT>
