<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our primary objective was to examine the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and extramural delivery following digoxin use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective single-cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women between 18 and 24 weeks of estimated gestational age who received digoxin in preparation for D&amp;E at our outpatient facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We queried two electronic databases to collect data on the frequency of extramural delivery and the rate of perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2008, 4906 abortions were performed between 18 and 24 weeks of estimated gestation with digoxin injection administered as feticidal agent 1 day prior to D&amp;E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extramural delivery frequency was 0.30%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> frequency was 0.04% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the frequency of extramural deliveries across procedure year (p = .2), estimated gestational age (p = .3), race/ethnicity (p = .2) or maternal age (p = .3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rates of extramural delivery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> are acceptably low following digoxin use prior to scheduled D&amp;E </plain></SENT>
