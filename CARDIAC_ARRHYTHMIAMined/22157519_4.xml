<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Unlike antiarrhythmic drugs, the safety and beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blockade (ARB) in patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical efficacy of ARBs to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF) so far only has been shown in patients with structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the primary outcome of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">Angiotensin II</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">Antagonist</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004757'>Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> (ANTIPAF) trial, which investigated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> medoxomil compared with placebo on AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The ANTIPAF trial was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial analyzing the AF burden (percentage of days with documented episodes of paroxysmal AF) during a 12-month follow-up as the primary study end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hundred thirty patients with documented paroxysmal AF without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> were randomized to placebo or 40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant therapy with ARBs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, and antiarrhythmic drugs was prohibited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed using daily transtelephonic ECG (tele-ECG) recordings independent of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intention-to-treat population of the trial encompassed 425 patients (placebo group, n=211; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group, n=214) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 87 818 tele-ECGs were analyzed in these patients during follow-up (placebo group, 44 888 ECGs; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48416">olmesartan</z:chebi> group, 42 930 ECGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, a mean of 207 tele-ECGs were recorded per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary end point (AF burden) was not different between the 2 groups (P=0.770) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcome parameters, including quality of life, also were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In particular, time to first AF recurrence, time to persistent AF, and number of hospitalizations were not different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The time to prescription of recovery medication (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi>) was the only parameter showing an intergroup difference, with earlier prescription of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2663">amiodarone</z:chebi> in the placebo group (P=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One year of ARB therapy per se does not reduce the number of AF episodes in patients with documented paroxysmal AF without structural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
