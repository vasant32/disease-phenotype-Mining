<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation, the pacing lead is usually positioned in the coronary sinus (CS) to stimulate the left ventricular (LV) epicardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transvenous LV endocardial pacing via transseptal puncture has been proposed as an alternative method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemodynamic effects of CRT through LV endocardial pacing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> patients by analyzing LV pressure-volume relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: LV pressure and volume data were determined via conductance catheter during CRT device implantation in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the standard epicardial CS pacing, the following endocardial LV sites were systematically assessed: the site transmural to the CS lead, the LV apex, the septal midwall, the basal lateral free wall, and the midlateral free wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four atrioventricular delays were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement of systolic function with CRT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> LV pacing configurations, whereas no differences in systolic or diastolic function were detected between LV epicardial and endocardial transmural sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal pacing site varied among patients but was rarely related to relatively longer activation delays, as assessed by analyzing endocardial electric activation maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, positioning the pacing lead at the optimal endocardial LV site in each patient significantly improved LV performance in comparison with conventional CS site stimulation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, 83 [79-112] mL versus 73 [62-89] mL; P=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pacing at the optimal individual LV endocardial site yields enhanced LV performance in comparison with conventional CS site stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endocardial LV pacing might constitute an alternative approach to CRT, when CS pacing is not viable </plain></SENT>
