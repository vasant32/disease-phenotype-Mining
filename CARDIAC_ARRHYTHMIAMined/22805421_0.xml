<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in decreasing complication rate and improving the outcome in dogs with gastric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> (GDV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective non-controlled study of 83 lidocaine-treated dogs with GDV compared to 47 untreated historical controls with GDV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University veterinary teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANIMALS: One hundred and thirty client-owned dogs with naturally occurring GDV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Study group dogs were treated at presentation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg, IV bolus) followed by constant rate infusion (CRI) of 0.05 mg/kg/min for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Historical control dogs did not receive any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were no group differences in age, body weight, time lag from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of clinical signs to presentation, rectal temperature and pulse rate at presentation, and proportion of gastric wall <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (AKI) were significantly (P&lt; 0.001 and P = 0.045, respectively) lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> group (10/83 [12%] versus 18/47 [38.3%] and 3/83 [3.6] versus 0/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median hospitalization time period was shorter (P = 0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> group compared to the controls (median 48 h; range 24-360 h versus median 72 h; range 24-144 h, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Early treatment with IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> bolus, followed by CRI of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> for 24 h post presentation decreased the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmias</z:hpo>, AKI and hospitalization time period significantly in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated dogs with GDV compared to untreated historical controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Due to the nonblinded, placebo-uncontrolled, nonrandomized nature of the current study, further evaluation of the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> in dogs with GDV is warranted </plain></SENT>
