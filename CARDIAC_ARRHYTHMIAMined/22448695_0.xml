<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of a significant amount of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001685'>myocardial fibrosis</z:hpo> might lead to insufficient response to resynchronization therapy We assumed that pre-implantation examination of global contractile reserve will allow prediction of the response to resynchronization treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 25 symptomatic patients (NYHA III) with severe systolic dysfunction [ejection fraction (EF) 28.9 ± 6.9%] with signs of electric asynchrony (QRS 120 ms) went through dobutamine echocardiography prior to resynchronization treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The global contractile reserve was determined from the change to EF at rest and at the peak of pharmacological burden (40 μg/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a rise in EF of more than 5% and/or endsystolic volume reduction of more than 15% after three months of resynchronization treatment were considered responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to non-responders, responders had higher increase in EF during dobutamine stress echocardiography (Δ 12.8 ± 7.4 % vs. Δ 3.4 ± 7.1 %, p = 0.0042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three months from the initiation of resynchronization therapy, the global myocardial contractile reserve also significantly correlated with EF increase (r = 0.67, p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 6% increase in EF during dobutamin stress echocardiography predicted responders to resynchronization therapy with 83% sensitivity and 75% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The global contractile reserve may play an important role in prediction of a response to resynchronization therapy </plain></SENT>
