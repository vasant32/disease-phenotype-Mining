<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infections</z:hpo> (ARIs), presumably to avoid small risks of progression to serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, even low risks of associated adverse drug events could result in many such events at the population level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to assess the risks and benefits of antibiotic use in a cohort of patients with ARIs, comparing outcomes of patients who were prescribed antibiotics with outcomes of patients not receiving antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS We used a June 1986 to August 2006 cohort of adult patients with ARI visits from a UK primary care database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure was an antibiotic prescribed with the visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were hospitalization within 15 days for (1) severe adverse drug events (hypersensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, hepatic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>), and (2) community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS The cohort included 1,531,019 visits with an ARI diagnosis; prescriptions for antibiotics were given in 65% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjusted risk difference for treated vs untreated patients per 100,000 visits was 1.07 fewer adverse events (95% CI, -4.52 to 2.38; P = .54) and 8.16 fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> hospitalizations (95% CI, -13.24 to -3.08; P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number needed to treat to prevent 1 hospitalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> was 12,255 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Compared with patients with ARI who were not treated with antibiotics, patients who were treated with antibiotics were not at increased risk of severe adverse drug events and had a small decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This small benefit from antibiotics for a common ambulatory diagnosis creates persistent tension; at the societal level, physicians are compelled to reduce antibiotic prescribing, thus minimizing future resistance, whereas at the encounter level, they are compelled to optimize the benefit-risk balance for that patient </plain></SENT>
