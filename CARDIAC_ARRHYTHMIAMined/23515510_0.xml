<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Published evidence on common ingredients of "energy drinks" and other dietary supplements widely used by consumers in hopes of enhancing athletic performance is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: Preworkout products- unregulated dietary supplements- typically contain "proprietary blends" of multiple ingredients, including <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>, dimethylamylamine, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, arginine, Î²-alanine, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, and phosphates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While some <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> labels instruct consumers to seek the advice of a health care professional before using the products, the labels usually do not disclose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ingredients or their precise amounts, and evidence to support the purported performance-enhancing benefits is generally lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is limited evidence to support the use of some preworkout supplement ingredients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, in one small placebo-controlled study (n = 12), the use of the energy drink Red Bull (containing <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>) 40 minutes before a simulated cycling time trial appeared to provide a meaningful ergogenic benefit; in another small study (n = 12), the use of a similar <z:chebi fb="111" ids="27732">caffeine</z:chebi>-containing product (Redline) by strength-trained athletes was found to improve reaction time, energy, and mental focus relative to placebo use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, published evidence on the use of the other ingredients listed above is scant, inconclusive, or conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects reported in association with preworkout supplements include gastrointestinal symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, blood pressure increases, and potential effects on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although evidence exists to support the performance-enhancement efficacy of some preworkout ingredients as standalone agents, published data on combination products are scant, inconclusive, or conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The safety of these products may be compromised if users consume larger-than-recommended amounts or use more than one product </plain></SENT>
