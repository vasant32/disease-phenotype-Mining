<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> has a high mortality rate due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo>, which is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recent research has indicated that it may be associated with fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo>, which occurs commonly in insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the habenular nucleus on cardiovascular activities in a rat model of insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult rats (n = 32) were divided into four groups: Group A (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control); Group B (insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>); Group C (habenular nuclei injury alone); and Group D (bilateral habenular nuclei injury one week prior to the insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was made in the right insula by microinjection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> (KA, 0.3 Î¼L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral activities were observed according to Racine scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The habenular nuclei were injured by direct current electric shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heart rate, blood pressure, and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> were measured in the four groups under quite conditions or during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the rats in Group B have significantly higher heart rate, blood pressure, and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> than those in Group A or Group D during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>; however, there was no difference in blood pressure, heart rate, or plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> between Groups A and C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the rats in the Group D had a significant lower blood pressure when compared with those in the Group C; however, no difference was observed in the heart rate and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The insula cortex has close association with cardiovascular activities in rats from our insula <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The habenular nuclei can regulate cardiovascular activities during insular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
