<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed from 137 depressed patients hospitalized on inpatient cardiac units for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome, decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and who were enrolled in a randomized trial of collaborative care <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects' demographic, medical, and psychiatric information at baseline was compiled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measures of health-related quality of life, cardiac symptoms, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e>, including the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> subscale (HADS-A) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, were obtained at baseline and serially during a 6-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between baseline HADS-A score and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> persistence (&lt;50% reduction in depressive symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 6 months was assessed by multivariate logistic regression accounting for the effects of multiple relevant medical and psychological covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between baseline HADS-A score and improvement in depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) from baseline at 6 months was assessed by linear regression accounting for the same covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline HADS-A score was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> persistence at 6 months (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.22, p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, higher baseline HADS-A score was associated with less improvement in depressive symptoms at 6 months (Î² = -0.34, p = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of depressed cardiac patients, higher baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> score was linked with lesser improvement in depressive symptoms and increased likelihood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> persistence at 6 months, independent of multiple relevant covariates </plain></SENT>
