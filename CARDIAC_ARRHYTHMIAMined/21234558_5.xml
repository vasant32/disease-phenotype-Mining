<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental recordings of I(Kr) reveal the effects of mutations at the channel level, but how these changes translate to the cell and tissue levels remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used computational models of human ventricular myocytes and tissues to predict and quantify the effects that de novo hERG mutations would have on cell and tissue electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations that decreased I(Kr) maximum conductance resulted in an increased cell and tissue action potential duration (APD) and a long QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG), whereas those that caused a positive shift in the inactivation curve resulted in a decreased APD and a short QT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue vulnerability to re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> was correlated with transmural dispersion of repolarisation, and any change to this vulnerability could be inferred from the ECG QT interval or T wave peak-to-end time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Faster I(Kr) activation kinetics caused cell APD alternans to appear over a wider range of pacing rates and with a larger magnitude, and spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in these cellular alternans resulted in discordant alternans at the tissue level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, from channel kinetic data, we can predict the tissue-level electrophysiological effects of any hERG mutations and identify how the mutation would manifest clinically, as either a long or short QT syndrome with or without an increased risk of alternans and re-entrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
