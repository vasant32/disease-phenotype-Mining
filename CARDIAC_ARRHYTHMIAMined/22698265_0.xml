<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms related to these abnormalities are usually benign, and fatalities reported in the literature are almost exclusively secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the heart through a partial defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the unusual case of a 44-year-old woman admitted for sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> could be initiated on electrophysiological study, and absence of most of the left pericardium was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
