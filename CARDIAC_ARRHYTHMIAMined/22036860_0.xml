<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> on outcome and adverse events in patients with septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases, and of Google Scholar, up to June 30, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies providing information on the outcome of patients with septic shock treated with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> compared to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observational and randomized trials were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because time of outcome assessment varied among trials, we evaluated 28-day mortality or closest estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> among trials was assessed using the Cochrane Q homogeneity test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Forest plot was constructed and the aggregate relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved five observational (1,360 patients) and six randomized (1,408 patients) trials, totaling 2,768 patients (1,474 who received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and 1,294 who received <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In observational studies, among which there was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (p &lt; .001), there was no difference in mortality (relative risk, 1.09; confidence interval, 0.84-1.41; p = .72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A sensitivity analysis identified one trial as being responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>; after exclusion of that trial, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was observed and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> administration was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (relative risk, 1.23; confidence interval, 1.05-1.43; p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In randomized trials, for which no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> or publication bias was detected (p = .77), <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (relative risk, 1.12; confidence interval, 1.01-1.20; p = .035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the two trials that reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo>, these were more frequent with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> than with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (relative risk, 2.34; confidence interval, 1.46-3.77; p = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with septic shock, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> administration is associated with greater mortality and a higher incidence of arrhythmic events compared to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
