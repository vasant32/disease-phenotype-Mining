<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is the first in its class, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor that was initially approved by the US FDA in 2004 for the treatment of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preapproval clinical trials, particularly for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> drugs, are limited in their ability to detect certain adverse effects and, therefore, the FDA and pharmaceutical sponsors collect and monitor reports of adverse events (AEs) following approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to screen the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database for novel AEs that may be attributed to bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The FDA AERS database was used to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AE reports for bevacizumab from February 2004 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disproportionality analysis was conducted for bevacizumab against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other drugs in the background by setting statistical significance at proportional reporting ratio (PRR) ≥2, observed case count ≥3 and chi-square ≥4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent clinical evaluation was performed to determine the clinical relevance of the findings and to group related events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 523 Preferred Terms (PTs) were disproportionally reported; following clinical review 63 (12%) were found to be both unlabelled and of clinical importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These PTs were grouped into 15 clinical disorder groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the clinical disorders, electrolyte abnormalities had the greatest number of reports (n = 426) followed by cardiovascular events (n = 421), gastrointestinal events (n = 345), <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders (n = 106) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> (n = 96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On sensitivity analysis, a number of clinically important unlabelled disorders, such as necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo>, vessel wall disorders, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction disorder</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> still met the statistical significance criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, out of 12 010 AE reports mentioning bevacizumab, it was listed as the suspect drug in 94.2% of the reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our disproportionality analysis identified many events that are already recognized as AEs of bevacizumab, but it also identified a number of clinically important unlabelled terms, which if confirmed in future studies would have potential implications for use of bevacizumab in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
