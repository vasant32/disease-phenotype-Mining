<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remote monitoring represents a paradigm shift from episodic office-based follow-up to continuous monitoring of device performance and patient and disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This lessens device clinical burden and may also lead to cost savings, although data on economic impact are only beginning to emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Remote monitoring technology has the potential to improve the outcomes through earlier detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and compromised device integrity, and possibly predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> hospitalizations through integration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> diagnostics and hemodynamic monitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remote monitoring platforms are also huge databases of patients and devices, offering unprecedented opportunities to investigate real-world outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, the current status of the field is described and future directions are predicted </plain></SENT>
