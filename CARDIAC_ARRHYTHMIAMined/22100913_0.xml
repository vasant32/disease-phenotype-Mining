<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study of commercial health plans claims data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newly diagnosed adult AF patients with ≥1 claim for an AF-related intervention within 12 months of diagnosis were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on initial treatment, patients were classified into pharmacotherapy or nonpharmacotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacotherapy group was subcategorized into rate-control or rhythm-control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression to assess linear trend and multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with treatment choice were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three thousand ninety-four newly diagnosed AF patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of these patients were initiated on pharmacotherapy with the majority (84%) receiving rate-control medications only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative distribution of the 3 treatment groups remained similar over the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, within the rate-control group, the use of beta blockers increased significantly (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nonpharmacotherapy over rate-control medications was higher in males but lower in patients aged ≥80 (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-2.20 and RRR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.30-0.77, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> significantly affected the treatment choice between nonpharmacotherapy and rate-control medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Medication therapy, especially rate-control strategies, remains the preferred initial therapy of choice </plain></SENT>
