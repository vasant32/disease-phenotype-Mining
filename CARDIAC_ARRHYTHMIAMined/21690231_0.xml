<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: To assess the characteristics of QTc intervals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> in women with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who received FEC100 adjuvant chemotherapy, electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded before and after each chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations between QTc interval prolongation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel genes were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 131 ECG records were obtained in 34 patients who received 153 cycles of FEC100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>QTc intervals could be measured in 127 records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant trend toward QTc interval prolongation after each treatment, persisting through four cycles of chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median QTc interval prolongations were 13, 11, 18, and 14 ms in the first through fourth cycles of chemotherapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>QTc intervals differed significantly between cycles 1 and 4 before treatment as well as after treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">supraventricular premature contraction</z:e> was noted in 3 (2.3%) of the 131 cycles in 2 (5.9%) of the 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between QTc interval prolongation and SNPs of <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This prospective study confirmed that FEC100 is associated with significant QTc interval prolongation in women with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
