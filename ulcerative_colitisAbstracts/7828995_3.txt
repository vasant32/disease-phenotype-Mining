A case of a patient who developed a polypoid area of mucosal prolapse three and a half years after having an ileoanal pouch for ulcerative colitis is presented.

This new manifestation of mucosal prolapse in a pelvic ileal reservoir underlines that the pouch as a neorectum is subject to disorders familiar in the rectum.
