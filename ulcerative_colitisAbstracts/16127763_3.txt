Various hepato-biliary complications are an increased incidence in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and portal bacteremia is well documented in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, few reports mention UC in association with liver abscesses. Recently, there are several reports describing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in association with disease exacerbation and steroid refractoriness in patients with UC. Here we present a case of refractory UC accompanied with multiple liver abscesses and CMV colitis. The patient, a 72-year-old male, with a five-year history of repeated admissions to our hospital for UC, presented with an exacerbation of his UC. Sigmoidoscopy performed on admission suggested that his UC was exacerbated, then he was given prednisolone and mesalazine orally, and betamethasone enemas. However, he had exacerbated symptoms. Repeat sigmoidoscopy revealed multiple longitudinal ulcers and pseudopolyps in the rectosigmoid colon. Although immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens and the serum testing for antigenemia were negative on admission and after the repeat sigmoidoscopy, they became histologically positive for CMV. Nonetheless, the patient developed spiking fevers, soon after ganciclovir was administered. Laboratory studies revealed an increased white cell count with left shift, and Enterococcus fecalis grew in blood cultures. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained and the diagnosis of liver abscesses associated with UC was made, based on CT results. The hepatic abscesses were successfully treated with intravenous meropenem for 6 wk, without further percutaneous drainage. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of multiple liver abscesses that develop during UC exacerbation complicated by CMV colitis.
