 AIM: To study susceptibility genes which may play a potential role in the pathogenesis and etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: To identify potential susceptibility genes we performed global gene expression profiling in patients with IBD and control specimens. For determination of an intrinsic gene expression profile in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) compared to normal subjects, mucosal biopsies of non-inflamed regions of the colon and the terminal ileum were subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used for verification of selected regulated candidate genes and a genetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: We could show that aquaporin-8 (AQP8) mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in the colon of UC patients compared to controls. Genetic analysis of the six exons and the promoter region of AQP8, however, revealed no mutations or polymorphisms in IBD patients. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that upregulation of AQP8 in the colon of UC patients represents a secondary phenomenon which may, due to altered water exchange of the distal intestinal mucosa, disturb the physiologic colonic mucus barrier and thus lead to chronic inflammation and ulceration.
