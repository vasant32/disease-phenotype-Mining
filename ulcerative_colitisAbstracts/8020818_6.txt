Extraintestinal features of ulcerative colitis are well recognised. Pulmonary complications include pulmonary vasculitis, fibrosing alveolitis, asthma, and chronic bronchial suppuration. A case is described of a patient with longstanding quiescent ulcerative colitis who developed a life threatening pulmonary complication, which is extremely sensitive to corticosteroid treatment.
