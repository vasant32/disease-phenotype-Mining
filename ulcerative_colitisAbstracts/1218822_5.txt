The mean concentrations of serum lysozyme were markedly higher in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in normal controls, and mean levels tended to be slightly higher in those with Crohn's disease than in those with colitis. The significance of these differences is unclear but the overlap between values in normal individuals and those with inflammatory bowel disease prevents the measurement having any discriminant value.
