 AIM: The goal of the current work was to analyse the prevalence of the +49A/G variant of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene (CTLA4) in Hungarian patients with Crohnos disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated subjects with CD and 150 with UC, and 170 matched controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The genotypes were determined by using PCR/RFLP test. RESULTS: The G allele frequency and the prevalence of the GG genotype were 38.1% and 12.3% in the CD group, 40.6% and 18.6% in the UC patients, and 37.4% and 15.9% in the control group, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study show that carriage of the +49G SNP in heterozygous or in homozygous form does not confer risk either for CD or for UC in the Hungarian population.
