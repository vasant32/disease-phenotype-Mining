The interleukin-2-deficient (IL-2(-/-)) mouse model of ulcerative colitis was used to test the hypothesis that colonic epithelial cells (CEC) directly respond to bacterial antigens and that alterations in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling may occur during the development of colitis. TLR expression and activation of TLR-mediated signaling pathways in primary CEC of healthy animals was compared with CEC in IL-2(-/-) mice during the development of colitis. In healthy animals, CEC expressed functional TLR, and in response to the TLR4 ligand LPS, proliferated and secreted the cytokines IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). However, the TLR-responsiveness of CEC in IL-2(-/-) mice was different with decreased TLR4 responsiveness and augmented TLR2 responses that result in IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion. TLR signaling in CEC did not involve NF-kappaB (p65) activation with the inhibitory p50 form of NF-kappaB predominating in CEC in both the healthy and inflamed colon. Development of colitis was, however, associated with the activation of MAPK family members and upregulation of MyD88-independent signaling pathways characterized by increased caspase-1 activity and IL-18 production. These findings identify changes in TLR expression and signaling during the development of colitis that may contribute to changes in the host response to bacterial antigens seen in colitis.
