AIM: To detect a possible association between the polymorphism of the (-670 A/G) Fas/Apo1 gene promoter and susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the Tunisian population. METHODS: The (-670 A/G) Fas polymorphism was analyzed in 105 patients with CD, 59 patients with UC, and 100 controls using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: Significantly lower frequencies of the Fas -670 A allele and A/A homozygous individuals were observed in CD and UC patients when compared with controls. Analysis of (-670 A/G) Fas polymorphism with respect to sex in CD and UC showed a significant difference in A/A genotypes between female patients and controls (P corrected = 0.004 in CD patients and P corrected = 0.02 in UC patients, respectively). Analysis also showed a statistically significant association between genotype AA of the (-670 A/G) polymorphism and the ileum localization of the lesions (P corrected = 0.048) and between genotype GG and the colon localization (P corrected = 0.009). The analysis of inflammatory bowel disease patients according to clinical behavior revealed no difference. CONCLUSION: Fas-670 polymorphism was associated with the development of CD and UC in the Tunisian population.
