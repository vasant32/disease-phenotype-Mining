The authors have produced a unique study of 624 patients with ulcerative colitis for they have achieved a 100% follow-up of all these patients admitted to the Radcliffe Infirmary or to the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, from 1938 to March 1962 inclusive or who attended as out-patients during the same period. They are therefore able to present a most important analysis of the natural history of ulcerative colitis as it occurs in the general population. Part I concerns the short-term prognosis in the initial attack, Part II the long-term prognosis; Part III discusses the complications of the disease, and Part IV the risk of carcinoma.
