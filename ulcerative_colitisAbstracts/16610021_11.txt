 AIM: To report our experience with the use of granulocytapheresis (GCAP) in 14 patients with active steroid-refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in order to evaluate its efficacy in achieving remission and maintaining a long lasting symptom-free period. METHODS: The activity of the disease was evaluated by clinical activity index (CAI) and endoscopic index (EI) in ulcerative colitis (UC), while by Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) in Crohn's disease (CD). The patients were treated using the Adacolumn system, an adsorption column which selectively binds to granulocytes and monocytes. One session/week of GCAP was performed for 5 wk. Steroids were stopped during apheresis. RESULTS: All the patients completed the five-week course showing no complications. At the end of the last session, 93% of patients showed a clinical remission of the disease that persisted for 6 mo. Nine months after the end of the treatment, 60% of the cases maintained remission, while 23% of the patients were still in clinical remission after 12 mo. CONCLUSION: Even if the number of our patients with steroid-refractory IBDs was not big, we can assert that GCAP is well tolerated and effective, especially in the first six months after the treatment, in a significant percentage of cases. The rate of sustained response drops slightly after 6 mo and significantly after 12 mo, however the absence of severe side effects can be a stimulus for further evaluating new schedules of treatment.
