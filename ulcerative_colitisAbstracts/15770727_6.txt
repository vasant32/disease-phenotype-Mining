 AIM: To describe the effect of Rheum tanguticum polysaccharide (RTP) on hydrogen peroxide-induced human intestinal epithelial cell injury. METHODS: Hydrogen peroxide (100 micromol/L) was introduced to induce human intestinal epithelial cell injury. Cells were pretreated with RTP (30,100,300 microg/mL) for 24 h before exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay and morphological observation. Acridine orange staining and flow cytometry were performed to assess cell apoptosis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were measured by spectrophotometry with corresponding assay kits. RESULTS: Following exposure to H(2)O(2), a marked decrease in cell survival and SOD activity, increased production of MDA, LDH leakage and cell apoptosis were found. Pretreatment of the cells with RTP could significantly elevate cell survival, SOD activity and decrease the level of MDA, LDH activity and cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: RTP may have cytoprotective and anti-oxidant effects against H(2)O(2)-induced intestinal epithelial cell injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis and necrosis. This might be one of the possible mechanisms of RTP for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in rats.
