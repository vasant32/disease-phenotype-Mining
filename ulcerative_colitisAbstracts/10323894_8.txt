BACKGROUND: Treatment of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease with sulphasalazine causes several adverse effects, including hepatitis. Sulphasalazine is cleaved by colonic bacteria into 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphapyridine. Received wisdom was that 5-aminosalicylic acid was topically active, whereas sulphapyridine was absorbed and caused immunoallergic side effects. Mesalazine, a slow release formulation of 5-aminosalicylic acid, was expected to be a safe alternative. However, several cases of acute hepatitis have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 65 year old man had increased liver enzymes, anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies and IgG levels, and lesions of chronic hepatitis after 21 months of mesalazine treatment. Although liver dysfunction had been identified eight months earlier, simvastatin rather than mesalazine had been withdrawn, without any improvement. In contrast, liver enzyme and IgG levels became normal and autoantibodies disappeared after discontinuation of mesalazine administration. CONCLUSION: Contrary to initial expectations, mesalazine can cause most of the sulphasalazine induced adverse effects, and hepatic side effects may be almost as frequent. When liver dysfunction occurs, mesalazine administration should be discontinued to avoid the development of chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis.
