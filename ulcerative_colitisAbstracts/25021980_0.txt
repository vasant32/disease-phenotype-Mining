INTRODUCTION: We have previously demonstrated concerningly high 3-year mortality following hospitalisation with ulcerative colitis (UC) between 1998 and 2000 in Scotland.(1) We have extended these studies by examining 3-year mortality following hospitalisation with UC in Scotland between 2007-2009, providing an opportunity for comparison with our earlier results. AIM: To compare 3-year mortality, and factors related to mortality, in Scottish patients hospitalised with ulcerative colitis (UC) between Period 1 (1998-2000) and Period 2 (2007-2009). METHODS: The Scottish Morbidity Records and linked datasets were used to assess 3-year crude mortality, standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and multivariate analyses of factors associated with 3-year mortality. The 3-year mortality was determined after four admission types: surgery-elective or emergency; medical-elective or emergency. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASR) were used to compare mortality rates between periods. RESULTS: The admission rate with UC increased from 10.6 per 100,000 of the Scottish population per year in Period 1 to 11.6 in Period 2 (p = 0.046). Among those admitted with UC, the proportion aged <30yrs increased (p = 0.009). Crude and adjusted 3-year mortality fell between time periods (Crude 12.2% [Period 1] to 8.3% [Period 2], adjusted OR 0.59, CI 0.42 to 0.81, p = 0.04). Following emergency medical admission, 3-year mortality was reduced in Period 2 (OR 0.58, p = 0.003). Within the >65 yrs age group crude 3-year mortality fell (38.8% to 28.7%, p = 0.02). The overall SMR in period 1 was 3.04 and 2.96 in Period 2. Directly age standardised mortality decreased from 373 (CI 309-437) to 264 (CI 212-316) per 10,000 person years. On multivariate analysis, older age and co-morbid remained associated with 3-year mortality in Period 2. CONCLUSION: Although the mortality associated with admission remains high at 3 years, crude and adjusted rates suggest significant reductions over the last decade.
