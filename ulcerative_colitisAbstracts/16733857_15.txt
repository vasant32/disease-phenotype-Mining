 AIM: To investigate the relationship between ulcerative colitis (UC) clinical activity index (CAI) and circulating levels of IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-18. METHODS: Blood levels of IL-1ra, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-18 were measured in 31 patients with active UC, the mean CAI was 11.1, ranging from 5-25; and 12 healthy individuals as controls. Patients were given granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) with Adacolumn. Leucocytes which bear the FcgammaR and complement receptors were adsorbed to the column leucocytapheresis carriers. Each patient could receive up to 11 GMA sessions over 8 wk. RESULTS: We found strong correlations between CAI and IL-10 (r = 0.827, P < 0.001), IL-6 (r = 0.785, P < 0.001) and IL-18 (r = 0.791, P < 0.001). IL-1ra was not correlated with CAI. Following GMA therapy, 24 of the 31 patients achieved remission and the levels of all 4 cytokines fell to the levels in healthy controls. Further, blood levels of IL-1ra and IL-10 increased at the column outflow and inflow at 60 min suggesting release from leucocytes that adhered to the carriers.
