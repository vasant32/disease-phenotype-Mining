Objective. To study effect and its mechanism of Bifid Triple Viable for initially treating ulcerative colitis with 5-aminosalicylic acid. Methods. 82 patients, who were firstly diagnosed as ulcerative colitis, were randomized into experiment group (41 cases, treated with Bifid Triple Viable and Etiasa) and control group (41 cases, treated with Etiasa). The clinic symptom score, colon mucosa inflammation score, and some immune indices were detected and compared between two groups before and two months after treatment. Results. Two months after treatment, the clinical symptom score, colon mucosa inflammation score, and IL-1Î² expression in colon mucosa decreased significantly (P < 0.01), and IL-10 and IgA expressions in colon mucosa increased significantly (P < 0.01). Those differences were more marked in experiment group than control group (P < 0.05). However, peripheral blood T cell subgroup, immunoglobulins, and complements had no significant difference between two groups two months after treatment, but the ratio of peripheral blood CD4+ T cell to CD8+ T cell in experiment group increased more than that in control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Bifid Triple Viable contributed to Etiasa to treat ulcerative colitis in inducing remission period, which was perhaps related to affecting the patient's immune function.
