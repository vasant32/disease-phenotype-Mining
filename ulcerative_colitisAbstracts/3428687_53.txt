One hundred and sixty two consecutive patients attending a clinic for inflammatory bowel disease (91 Crohn's, 71 ulcerative colitis) were assessed for the presence of anxiety and depression using a simple self-rating questionnaire (HAD scale) and a detailed evaluation (DSM-III). The overall prevalence of psychiatric illness (DSM-III) in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease was 34% and 33% respectively. There was no statistically significant association in ulcerative colitis patients between the presence of psychiatric illness and the present physical illness. Psychiatric illness was more common in the physically ill patients with Crohn's disease, compared with those who were well: 50% v 8% (p less than 0.01), using (HAD) criteria 66% v 37% (p less than 0.001). The presence of patients between the presence of psychiatric illness and the presence of physical illness. Psychiatric who were well: 50% v 8% (p less than 0.01) by DSM-III criteria, using (HAD) criteria 66% v 37% (p less than 0.001). The presence of psychiatric illness adversely affected physical recovery. Seventeen percent recovered when psychiatrically ill v 53% when psychiatrically well (p less than 0.025). The HAD scale was assessed as a screening method for psychiatric illness in this medical setting and had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 79%.
