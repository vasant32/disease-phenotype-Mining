Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, and identification of new CRC biomarkers will be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. For isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis, fresh CRC and adjacent, colonic adenoma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and noncancerous colonic epithelial tissue were obtained from patients at the 2nd Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, China. The function of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HnRNP M) during the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro was evaluated. One hundred and twenty-six differentially expressed proteins were identified by iTRAQ analysis. The expression of HnRNP M exhibited progressive changes during the carcinogenic process and was validated by Western blot. The upregulation of HnRNP M correlated with cancer recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, biological role exploration suggests that HnRNP M positively regulates cell cycle progression, promotes cell growth and invasion in vitro, and increases the colony-forming ability of LS174T cells. The present data demonstrate that the upregulation of HnRNP M is involved in human colorectal epithelial carcinogenesis and may serve as a carcinoma biomarker for CRC.
