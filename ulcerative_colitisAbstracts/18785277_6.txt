Wireless capsule endoscopy has become the first imaging tool for small bowel examination. Recently, new capsule endoscopy applications have been developed, such as esophageal capsule endoscopy and colon capsule endoscopy. Clinical trials results have shown that colon capsule endoscopy is feasible, accurate and safe in patients suffering from colonic diseases. It could be a good alternative in patients refusing conventional colonoscopy or when it is contraindicated. Upcoming studies are needed to demonstrate its utility for colon cancer screening and other indications such us ulcerative colitis. Comparative studies including both conventional and virtual colonoscopy are also required.
