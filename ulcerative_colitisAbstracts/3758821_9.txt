We present two cases of ulcerative colitis associated with a chronic pattern of hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Progression of the hepatic disorder appeared to be unrelated to the activity of the colitis. Liver function tests were normal until a late stage in the disease except for a high serum alkaline phosphate and a low serum albumin. This combination of abnormalities together with ascites merit further investigation and should raise the suspicion of hepatic vein thrombosis complicating ulcerative colitis.
