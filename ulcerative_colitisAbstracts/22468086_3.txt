AIM: To assess attitudes and trends regarding the use of high-dose infliximab among pediatric gastroenterologists for treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A 19-item survey was distributed to subscribers of the pediatric gastroenterology (PEDSGI) listserv. Responses were submitted anonymously and results compiled in a secure website. RESULTS: A total of 113 subscribers (88% based in the United States) responded (101 pediatric gastroenterology attendings and 12 pediatric gastroenterology fellows). There were 46% in academic medical institutions and 39% in hospital-based practices. The majority (91%) were treating >10 patients with UC; 13% were treating >100 patients with UC; 91% had prescribed infliximab (IFX) 5 mg/kg for UC; 72% had prescribed IFX 10 mg/kg for UC. Using a 5-point Likert scale, factors that influenced the decision not to increase IFX dosing in patients with UC included: "improvement on initial dose of IFX" (mean: 3.88) and "decision to move to colectomy" (3.69). Lowest mean Likert scores were: "lack of guidelines or literature regarding increased IFX dosing" (1.96) and "insurance authorization or other insurance issues" (2.34). "Insurance authorization or other insurance issues" was identified by 39% as at least somewhat of a factor (Likert score â‰¥ 3) in their decision not to increase the IFX dose. IFX 10 mg/kg was more commonly used for the treatment of pediatric UC among responders based in the United States (75/100) compared to non-United States responders (6/13, P = 0.047). Induction of remission was reported by 78% of all responders and 81% reported maintenance of remission with IFX 10 mg/kg. One responder reported one death with IFX 10 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: IFX 10 mg/kg is more commonly used in the United States to treat pediatric UC. Efficacy and safety data are required to avoid insurance barriers for its use.
