Super-imposed infection with intestinal organisms can mimic a flare-up of underlying disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report a case of patient with long standing ulcerative colitis (UC), who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea and low-grade fever after receiving systemic corticosteroids for an unrelated disorder. Despite a negative stool examination, a peripheral eosinophilia reappeared upon tapering down of a corticosteroid dose. Subsequently, duodenal biopsies showed evidence for Strongyloides, presumably acquired 20 years ago when the patient was residing in Brazil. The patient fully recovered following anti-helmintic therapy. This case underscores the importance of considering Strongyloides in the work-up of flaring-up IBD patients, even if a history of residing or traveling to endemic areas is in the distant past.
