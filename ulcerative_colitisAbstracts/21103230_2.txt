Ménétrier disease (MD) is a rare hypertrophic condition of the gastric mucosa. The unusual association of MD with ulcerative colitis (UC) has been reported in the literature in eight cases. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is overexpressed in UC and appears to play a role in colonic healing and repair. Overproduction of TGF-alpha in murine stomach has been shown to induce gastric hypertrophy similar to MD. It can be hypothesized that increased expression of TGF-alpha may occur in the gastric mucosa in patients with UC and may lead to MD. We report the ninth case of MD associated with UC. The role of TGF-alpha and treatment with cetuximab are discussed.
