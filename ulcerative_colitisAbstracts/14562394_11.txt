 AIM: To study the effects of Rheum tanguticum polysaccharide(-1) (RTP(-1)) on ulcerative colitis in rats induced by 2, 4, 6-trinitrophene sulphonic acid (TNBS) and their possible mechanism. METHODS: RTP1 (200 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) extracted from Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Regel was administrated to rats with colitis induced by TNBS for 5 d, 7 d, 10 d and 14 d, respectively. The effects of RTP1 and dexamethasone (DX, 0.2 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) were contrastively investigated. The MPO level and SOD activity were determined by chromatometry. The expansion and protein expression of CD4+T lymphocytes isolated from colon mucosae and mesenteric lymph nodes of colitis rats were performed by immunohistochemical analysis and Western-blot methods. RESULTS: Treatments of RTP1 (200 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) significantly reduced diarrhea, mortality, colon mass, ulcer areas and MPO level in colon mucosae on days 5, 7, 10 and 14 (5.2+/-1.4, 5.4+/-0.7, 5.2+/-1.8, P<0.05. 3.4+/-0.8, P<0.01. 16.1+/-12.1, P<0.01. 31.8+/-8.6, 17.7+/-5.3, 12.7+/-4.1, P<0.05). The effects of RTP1 were similar to those noted above in DX group, but there were no immunosuppressive effects of DX in RTP(-1) group, such as body mass loss, thymus and spleen atrophy. The decreased number and down-regulated protein levels of CD4+T cells isolated from the colon of colitis rats treated with RTP1 were found. CONCLUSION: RTP1 shows significantly protective effects but lower side effects on rats with colitis induced by TNBS. The mechanism may be due to the resistance to over expansion of CD4.
