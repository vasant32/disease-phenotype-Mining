AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of expression of tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Thirty UC specimens taken by colonoscopy from patients with active UC treated at the Department of Pathology, Central Hospital Affiliated to Shenyang Medical College from February 2010 to January 2012 were included in an experimental group, and 30 normal colon tissue samples taken by colonoscopy from non-UC patients were included in a control group. Expression of TF and TFPI in UC and normal colon tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The positive rate of TF in UC was significantly higher than that in normal colon tissue (63% vs 33%, χ (2) = 5.41, P < 0.05). The positive rate of TFPI in UC was also significantly higher than that in normal colon tissue (43% vs 17%, χ (2) = 5.08, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Positive rates of TF and TFPI expression in UC are significantly higher than those in normal colon tissue. TF and TFPI may play an important role in the pathogenesis of UC.
