Mortality rates for ulcerative colitis in England and Wales over the years 1946 to 1967 showed trends which varied with age. Between the ages of 15 and 34 rates fell with only minor irregularities. At ages 35 to 64, rates were constant from 1946 to 1957 and then began to decline. At ages 65 and above, rates rose during most of the period but with a recent tendency to stabilize. These trends are discussed in relation to possible effects of the introduction of steroids and other therapies.
