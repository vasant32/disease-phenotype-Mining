 BACKGROUND: Disorders of coagulation have long been associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Children, as well as adults, with both active and inactive ulcerative colitis have been found to have abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis. Disseminated intravascular coagulation arises from an overwhelming of the haemostatic regulatory mechanisms leading to an excessive generation of thrombin and a failure of the normal inhibitory pathways to prevent systemic effects of this enzyme. Ulcerative colitis has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation in conjunction with septicemia, toxic megacolon and surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A fourteen-year-old boy with a history of poorly controlled ulcerative colitis presented with nonbilious emesis, hematochezia, and hematuria. Laboratory workup revealed disseminated intravascular coagulation. He was placed on triple antibiotics therapy. An infectious workup came back negative. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a marked thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall as well as wall thickening of the rectosigmoid, ascending, transverse, and descending colon. Patient's clinical status remained stable despite a worsening of laboratory values associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patient was begun on high dose intravenous steroids with improvement of the disseminated intravascular coagulation laboratory values within 12 hours and resolution of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy within 4 days. A thorough infectious workup revealed no other causes to his disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of hypercoagulable states associated with ulcerative colitis varies from mild to severe. Although disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with ulcerative colitis is usually related to septicemia, toxic megacolon or surgery, we present a case of an ulcerative colitis flare resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation and a bladder hematoma.
