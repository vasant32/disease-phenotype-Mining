 AIM: An insertion mutation at nucleotide 3020 (3020insC) in the Caspase recruitment domain gene (CARD15), originally reported as NOD2, is strongly associated with Crohn's disease. The C-insertion mutation at nucleotide 3020 (3020inC) in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region results in a frameshift in the 10(th) LRR followed by a premature stop codon. This truncation mutation is responsible for the inability to activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The present study aimed to genotype NOD2/CARD15 gene 3020insC frameshift mutation in Chinese patients with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: We genotyped an insertion polymorphism affecting the leucine-rich region of the protein product by the allele specific PCR in 74 unrelated patients with ulcerative colitis of Han nationality in Hubei Province of China, 15 patients with Crohn's disease and 172 healthy individuals. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the genotype and allele frequencies of the C-insertion mutation of NOD2 gene among patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: NOD2 gene 3020insC frameshift mutation is not a major contributor to the susceptibility to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in Chinese Han patients.
