The relationship between motility and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders is at the same time complex and intriguing since these conditions might share some genetic, environmental, immunological and microbial predisposing factors. In addition, significant symptom overlapping may occur, muddling the waters within the clinical context. Although on one hand this represents a challenge for the clinician for a potential under- or over-treatment and diagnostic delay, on the other hand it possibly represents an opportunity for the researcher to better disclose the intimate relationship between chronic (often low-grade) inflammation, motor disorders and deranged sensory function. The best example is probably represented by Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In fact, a number of gastrointestinal motor disorders have been described in association with these diseases, disorders which span from the esophagus to the anorectum, and which will be extensively covered in this review. It is conceivable that at least part of this derangement is strictly related to inflammatory cytokine trafficking and neuromuscular changes; however, given the high prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in the general population, this overlap might also be serendipitous. However, it is worth noting that literature data on this topic are relatively scarce, sometimes quite outdated, and mostly focused on the interplay between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, both researchers and clinicians must be aware that symptoms related to gastrointestinal motility disorders may be highly prevalent in both active and inactive inflammatory bowel disease, correlate with greater psychological comorbidity and poorer quality of life, and may negatively influence the therapeutic approaches.
