Over the past 30 years, health related quality of life (HRQOL) has developed into a scientific index of subjective health status. Measurement of HRQOL is now clearly a mandatory component in evaluating interventions and management of medical and surgical diseases. In designing comprehensive and meaningful clinical studies particular attention ought to be made of measures of HRQOL. This is clearly very important in inflammatory bowel disease. Both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) have a major impact on HRQOL. The chronic and unrelenting nature of these diseases, the often early age of onset, and the impact on social and sexual aspects of life significantly change patient's perception, body image and quality of life. This manuscript is an overview of the available published data on HRQOL in UC and CD patients focusing on the impact of surgical therapy. While these two diseases may have some similarities in their management, clearly their impact on quality of life and the effects of are significantly different. Hence we are presenting the data separately.
