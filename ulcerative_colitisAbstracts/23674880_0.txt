AIM: To evaluate the association between HLA-DRB1 alleles and Han and Uyghur ulcerative colitis (UC) patients residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. METHODS: In this study, 102 UC patients (53 Han including 22 men and 31 women, and 49 Uyghur patients including 25 men and 24 women; aged 48.07 Â± 15.83 years) and 310 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the Department of Gastroenterology, Xinjiang People's Hospital of China from January 2010 to May 2011. UC was diagnosed based on the clinical, endoscopic and histological findings following Lennard-Jones criteria. Blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted by routine laboratory methods, and both polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing were used to identify HLA-DRB1 allele variants. The potential association between genetic variation and UC in Han and Uyghur patients was examined. There were no statistical differences in HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in Han UC patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the sex ratio between the controls and UC patients (P = 0.740). In Han patients with UC (n = 53), HLA-DRB1 *03, *13 allele frequencies were lower than in healthy controls (n = 161), but not statistically significant, and HLA-DRB1*04*11*14 allele frequencies were higher than in healthy controls, but without statistical significance. Differences between Uyghur UC patients and the control group were observed for HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DRB1*13, both showed a greater frequency in UC patients (10.21% vs 2.69%, P = 0.043; 14.29% vs 4.03%, P = 0.019). HLA-DRB1*14 also showed a greater frequency in UC patients (14.29% vs 2.69%, P = 0.006). The frequencies of DRB1*04, *13*14 alleles were increased in Uyghur UC patients compared with normal controls. The frequency of DRB1 * 08 was decreased in Uyghur UC patients compared with normal controls. HLA-DRB1 alleles showed no association with UC in Han patients. There were no statistical differences in HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies in Han UC patients. The frequencies of DRB1*04, *13*14 alleles were increased in Uyghur UC patients compared with normal controls. The frequency of DRB1*08 was decreased in Uyghur UC patients compared with normal controls. Polymorphism of the HLA-DRB1 gene may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of UC between Han and Uyghur UC patients in China. CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1*04*13*14 and DRB1*08 may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of UC between Han and Uyghur UC patients.
