A method is described for determining prostaglandin synthetase activity in milligram amounts of tissue. The procedure is based on the conversion of 14C-arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 and F2alpha-like substances. High levels of prostaglandin synthetase activity occurred in the inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis and fell during successful drug therapy, but it is not yet known whether the cause of the inflammation first involves increased PG synthetase activity, or whether inflammation caused increase of PG synthetase.
