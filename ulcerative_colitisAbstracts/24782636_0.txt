The association of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is known as an overlap syndrome (OS). OS can also be described in the setting of concomitant presence of AIH and PSC. These diseases can in some cases be associated with ulcerative colitis. In this case report we describe, to our knowledge, the first case in the literature of a young Caucasian male suffering from ulcerative colitis and an overlap syndrome consisting of an association between PSC-AIH, with the concomitant presence of a membranous glomerulonephritis.
