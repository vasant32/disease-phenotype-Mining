Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis following total proctocolectomy has become part of the standard surgical treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis who require colectomy. Although this surgery has improved patient quality of life and significantly reduced the risk of dysplasia or neoplasia in ulcerative colitis patients, complications are common. Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication of ileal pouch surgery and has a significant adverse impact on patient quality of life. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pouchitis are not straightforward, and the management of pouchitis, particularly chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis, which is one of the leading causes of pouch failures, can be challenging.
