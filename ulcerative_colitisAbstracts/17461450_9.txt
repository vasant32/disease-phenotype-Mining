 AIM: To evaluate prospectively usefulness of fecal lactoferrin (Lf) and fecal hemoglobin (Hb) in the diagnosis of colorectal diseases. METHODS: Fecal Lf and Hb were measured using ELISA in 872 patients before they underwent colorectal endoscopy. RESULTS: Lf was positive in 18 (50%) of 36 patients with colorectal cancer, 25 (15.9%) of 157 with colorectal polyps, 29 (46.8%) of 62 with ulcerative colitis, and 25 (62.5%) of 40 (62.5%) with Crohn's disease. The Hb-positive rates were 50%, 12.1%, 41.9% and 32.5%, respectively. Of the 318 patients free of abnormalities by colorectal endoscopy, Lf was positive in 29 (9.1%) and Hb was positive in 15 (4.7%). Among patients with Crohn's disease, the Lf-positive rate was significantly higher than the Hb-positive rate. If either high Lf or Hb levels were considered positive, the positive rates rose to 61.1%, 51.6%, and 67.5% in the colorectal cancer group, ulcerative colitis group, and Crohn's disease group, respectively. If both high Lf and Hb levels were rated positive, the positive predictive values (PPV) were 21% for colorectal cancer, 33% for ulcerative colitis, and 17% for Crohn's disease, and PPV of high Hb level alone was 18%, 25% and 13%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Fecal Lf and Hb were found useful in the detection of colorectal diseases, and the combination of the two measurements appears to increase the sensitivity and efficacy of diagnosis.
