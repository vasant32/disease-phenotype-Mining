 AIM: To study the role of the intracellular receptor domain of gp130 in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We amplified and sequenced the complete exon 17 of the human gp130 gene in 146 patients with IBD. According to clinical and histopathological signs, the 146 patients with IBD were classified as having Crohn's disease (n = 73) or ulcerative colitis (n = 63), or as indeterminate status (n = 10). RESULTS: No mutations in exon 17 of the gp130 gene could be detected in any of the 146 patients with IBD examined. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that mutations in exon 17 of the gp130 gene are involved in the pathogenesis of human IBD.
