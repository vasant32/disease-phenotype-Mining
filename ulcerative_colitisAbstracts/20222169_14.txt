AIM: To identify specific colonoscopic findings in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) complicated by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. METHODS: Among UC patients who were hospitalized due to exacerbation of symptoms, colonoscopic findings were compared between 15 CMV-positive patients and 58 CMV-negative patients. CMV infection was determined by blood test for CMV antigenemia. Five aspects of mucosal changes were analyzed (loss of vascular pattern, erythema, mucosal edema, easy bleeding, and mucinous exudates) as well as five aspects of ulcerative change (wide mucosal defect, punched-out ulceration, longitudinal ulceration, irregular ulceration, and cobblestone-like appearance). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each finding for CMV positivity were determined. RESULTS: The sensitivity of irregular ulceration for positive CMV was 100%. The specificity of wide mucosal defect was 95%. Punched-out ulceration and longitudinal ulceration exhibited relatively high sensitivity and specificity (more than 70% for each). CONCLUSION: Specific colonoscopic findings in patients with UC complicated by CMV infection were identified. These findings may facilitate the early diagnosis of CMV infection in UC patients.
