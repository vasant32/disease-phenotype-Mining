Prostaglandin synthetase activity in rectal biopsy specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis has been shown to fall on treatment with sulphasalazine, local steroids, and codeine phosphate. In vitro studies have shown that sulphasalazine is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, although less potent than indomethacin, whereas prednisolone and codeine phosphate were inactive. It is suggested that the therapeutic action of sulphasalazine may be related in part to its action in inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis.
