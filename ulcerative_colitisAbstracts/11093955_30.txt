This study tested the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) expression is increased at sites of fibrosis in diseased intestine of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). IGF-I mRNA was quantified by RNase protection assay in uninvolved and involved intestine of 13 CD patients (10 ileum, 3 colon) and 7 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (colon). In situ hybridization histochemistry compared the localization of IGF-I and procollagen alpha1(I) mRNAs. Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for IGF-I precursor, alpha-smooth muscle actin (A), vimentin (V), desmin (D), and c-kit were used to examine the mesenchymal cell subtypes that express IGF-I and collagen in uninvolved and involved ileum and colon of CD patients and "normal" ileum and colon from noninflammatory controls. IGF-I mRNA was elevated in involved ileum and colon of patients with CD but not in involved colon of patients with UC. IGF-I and procollagen alpha1(I) mRNA showed overlapping distribution within fibrotic submucosa and muscularis propria of involved CD ileum and colon. In involved CD intestine, increased IGF-I precursor expression localized to mesenchymal cells in regions of tissue disorganization and fibrosis in muscularis mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria. In these regions, there were increased numbers of V(+) cells relative to normal or uninvolved intestine. Increased IGF-I expression was localized to cells with a phenotype typical of fibroblasts (V(+)/A(-)/D(-)), myofibroblasts (V(+)/A(+)/D(+)), and, to a lesser extent, cells with normal enteric smooth muscle phenotype (V(-)/A(+)/D(+)). We conclude that increased IGF-I expression in multiple mesenchymal cell subtypes and increased numbers of cells with fibroblast/myofibroblast phenotype are involved in fibrosis associated with CD.
