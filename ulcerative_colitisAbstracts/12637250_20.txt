Butyrate enemas have been demonstrated to ameliorate inflammation in ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of this protective effect of butyrate is not known, and this study examines the effect of butyrate on epithelial function, inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression, and NF-kappaB activation in experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in rats by oral dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and by butyrate or saline enemas. Mucosal barrier function was assessed by electrical resistance and [14C]mannitol permeability. HSP70 production was determined by [35S]methionine labeling, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Activation of heat shock factors (HSFs) and NF-kappaB was evaluated by EMSA. Butyrate showed a significant protection against the decrease in cell viability, increase in mucosal permeability, and polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration seen in DSS colitis. Butyrate inhibited HSP70 expression in DSS colitis and also inhibited the activation of HSF and NF-kappaB. Thus butyrate enema was found to be cytoprotective in DSS colitis, an effect partly mediated by suppressing activation of HSP70 and NF-kappaB.
