AIM: To find evidences about whether NOD1/CARD4 insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with inflammatory bowel disease by meta-analysis. METHODS: We surveyed the studies on the association of NOD1/CARD4 insertion/deletion polymorphism with inflammatory bowel disease in PubMed. Meta-analysis was performed for genotypes GG/T vs T/T, GG/GG vs T/T, GG/T + GG/GG vs T/T, GG/GG vs T/T + GG/T, and GG allele vs T allele in a fixed/random effect model. RESULTS: We identified 8 studies (6439 cases and 4798 controls) in Caucasian populations using PubMed search. We found no association between NOD1/CARD4 insertion/deletion polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Stratification of cases by age showed that NOD1/CARD4 insertion/deletion polymorphism was associated with inflammatory bowel disease in younger age group at onset (< 40 years) (GG vs T: OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50-0.93, P = 0.02; GG/T + GG/GG vs T/T: OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.59-0.85, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates an association between NOD1/CARD4 insertion/deletion polymorphism and inflammatory bowel disease in the younger age group at onset (< 40 years) in Caucasian populations.
