Oral disodium cromoglycate (200 mg qds) has been tested in 26 patients with ulcerative colitis that was resistant to medical treatment. In a double-blind crossover trial disodium cromoglycate and placebo were added to conventional treatment in random order, each for four weeks. There was no significant difference in therapeutic effect between disodium cromoglycate and placebo.
