Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, occurs in genetically susceptible individuals who mount inappropriate immune responses to endoluminal antigens. Serologic and genetic markers have shown great potential for clinical application in Crohn's disease (CD), particularly for prognostication. However, their use is not as well established in UC. The aim of this paper is to highlight the clinical relevance of these markers for diagnostics and prognostication in UC. This review identified studies that cited the use of serum and genetic biomarkers in UC when these biomarkers were used in diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response prediction applications. Several serologic and genetic markers associated with UC were identified, and this review presents and summarizes these data, focusing on the biomarkers' established and emerging diagnostic and prognostic utility. Although more established in CD, the data provided by serologic and genetic testing in UC has the potential to enhance clinical decision making.
