Recent insight into the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have led to the development of new treatment options, with a progressive shift to more evidence-based strategies based on sound pathophysiological rationales. A better understanding of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathophysiology has progressively resulted in a more frequent use of immunomodulators. We review the recommended or suggested use of conventional immunomodulators such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate in the treatment of IBD. Moreover, an effort is made to explore some critical areas in which early and more diffuse use of these agents may be advocated.
