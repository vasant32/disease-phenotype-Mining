The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma(PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor highly expressed in the colon and playing a key role in bacterial induced inflammation. Regulation of colon inflammation by this receptor has been well demonstrated in many experimental models of colitis but also in patients with ulcerative colitis, characterised by impaired expression of PPARgamma confined to their colon epithelial cells. Recent data showing that PPARgamma was the major functional receptor mediating the common aminosalicylate activities in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have also reinforced the roles of this receptor in the control of intestinal inflammation. The aims of this review are to discuss the potential roles of PPARgamma in the physiopathology of IBD, as well as the emerging therapeutic strategies targeting this receptor.
