The Crohn's disease activity index, a similar index devised for patients with ulcerative colitis, and other commonly used laboratory indicators of disease activity have been studied in 50 patients with colonic inflammatory bowel disease undergoing routine colonoscopic assessment and compared with the histological extent and activity of disease. There was only poor correlation between the colonoscopic or histological findings and the indices of disease activity studied, showing that these are not reliable measures of disease activity or extent at the tissue level.
