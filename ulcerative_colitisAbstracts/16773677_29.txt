The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex on chromosome 6p21.3 is the most extensively studied genetic region in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Consistent evidence of linkage to IBD3 (6p21.1-23), an area which encompasses the HLA complex, has been demonstrated for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and a number of replicated associations with disease susceptibility and phenotype have recently emerged. However, despite these efforts the HLA susceptibility gene (s) for IBD remain elusive, a consequence of strong linkage disequilibrium, extensive polymorphism and high gene density across this region. This article reviews current knowledge of the role of HLA complex genes in IBD susceptibility and phenotype, and discusses the factors currently limiting the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice.
