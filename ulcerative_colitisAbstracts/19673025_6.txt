Infliximab (IFX) is currently the only biologic therapy used in the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). In the years to come, more biologic therapies will have a role in the management of moderate-to-severe UC. We report on two patients with steroid-dependent UC who, due to adverse reactions to IFX, have been under therapy with adalimumab for two years. Both patients received concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. Long term clinical remission and mucosal healing are described.
