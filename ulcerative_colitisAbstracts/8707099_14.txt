BACKGROUND: This report concerns a female patient now aged 24 years, diagnosed at the age of 7 years as suffering from chronic granulomatous disease. At age 20 she developed diarrhoea accompanied by rectal bleeding. Endoscopy showed extensive colitis. She failed to respond to medical treatment and underwent total colectomy two years later. AIMS: To discuss the histological changes in the colon in chronic granulomatous disease. RESULTS: There was extensive mucosal inflammation throughout colon and rectum resembling ulcerative colitis. In addition characteristic large pigmented macrophages were distributed in the basal mucosa and superficial submucosa. Similar cells accompanied by granulomata were present in mesenteric lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Colitis is an unusual clinical manifestation of chronic granulomatous disease but the presence and characteristic distribution of such pigmented macrophages in colonic biopsy in children and young adults may suggest the diagnosis.
