AIM: To investigate variants of immunity-related GTPase family M (IRGM) and NKX2-3 genes and genotype-phenotype in Eastern European patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: We analyzed 1707 Hungarian and Czech subjects with Crohn's disease (CD) (n = 810, age: 37.1 ± 12.6 years, duration: 10.7 ± 8.4 years) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 428, age: 43.7 ± 15.0 years, duration: 12.6 ± 9.9 years), as well as 469 healthy controls. IRGM rs13361189, NKX2-3 rs10883365 and ECM1 rs13294 polymorphisms were tested by LightCycler allele discrimination. Detailed clinical phenotypes were determined by reviewing the medical charts. RESULTS: NKX2-3 rs10883365 variant allele was associated with increased risk for CD (P = 0.009, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.48) and UC (P = 0.001, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.13-1.63), whereas variant IRGM allele increased risk for CD (P = 0.029, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.03-1.79). In contrast, ECM1 rs13294 was not associated with either CD or UC. In CD, the variant IRGM allele was associated with a colon-only location (P = 0.02, OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.07-2.44), whereas in UC, the ECM1 variant was associated with cutaneous manifestations (P = 0.002, OR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.48-7.63). Variant alleles did not predict resistance to steroids or azathioprine, efficacy of infliximab, or need for surgery. CONCLUSION: NKX2-3 and IRGM are susceptibility loci for IBD in Eastern European patients. Further studies are needed to confirm the reported phenotype-genotype associations.
