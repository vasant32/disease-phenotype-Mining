The metabolism of salicylazosulphapyridine was studied in 16 patients with ulcerative colitis admitted to hospital. The acetylator phenotype was determined on admission. The mean serum concentration (mug/ml) (at steady state eight +/- two days in patients responding to treatment) of SASP, total SP, and 5-ASA were 18.7 +/- 12.8; 53.7 +/- 23.1; and 1 +/- 0.9 for slow acetylators and 17.6 +/- 7.1; 31 +/- 9.0 and 1 +/- 0.9 for fast acetylators respectively. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of SASP, total SP, and 5-ASA were 4.6% +/- 3.1; 52% +/- 9.6 and 22.3 +/- 6.7% of the administered dose respectively. Serum total SP concentration of 20 to 50 mug/ml appeared to coincide with clinical improvement in the absence of any side effects related to salicylazosulphapyridine. No such relationship could be shown with serum SASP, individual metabolites, or 5-aminosalicyclic acid.
