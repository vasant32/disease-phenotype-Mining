While restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has significantly improved the quality of life in patients with underlying ulcerative colitis who require surgery, complications can occur.

The majority of patients respond favorably to antibiotic therapy. However, management of chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis remains a challenge.
