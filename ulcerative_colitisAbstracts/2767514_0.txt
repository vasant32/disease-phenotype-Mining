We describe a patient who presented with a pronounced neutrophil leucocytosis and leukaemoid reaction in association with toxic dilatation of the colon secondary to ulcerative colitis. Although the patient had been previously investigated, the significance of bowel disturbance had not been recognised. Once the inflammatory bowel disease was treated the haematological abnormality subsided.
