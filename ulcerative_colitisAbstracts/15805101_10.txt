Bradykinin is a mediator of inflammation, responsible for pain, vasodilation, and capillary permeability. Bradykinin receptor 1 (B(1)R) and bradykinin receptor 2 (B(2)R) are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate kinin effects. The latter is constitutive and rapidly desensitized; the former is induced by inflammatory cytokines and resistant to densensitization. The distribution of bradykinin receptors in human intestinal tissue was studied in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both B(2)R and B(1)R proteins are expressed in the epithelial cells of normal and IBD intestines. B(1)R protein is visualized in macrophages at the center of granulomas in CD. B(2)R protein is normally present in the apexes of enterocytes in the basal area and intracellularly in inflammatory tissue. In contrast, B(1)R protein is found in the basal area of enterocytes in normal intestine but in the apical portion of enterocytes in inflamed tissue. B(1)R protein is significantly increased in both active UC and CD intestines compared with controls. In patients with active UC, B(1)R mRNA is significantly higher than B(2)R mRNA. However, in inactive UC patients, the B(1)R and B(2)R mRNA did not differ significantly. Thus bradykinin receptors in IBD may reflect intestinal inflammation. Increased B(1)R gene and protein expression in active IBD provides a structural basis of the important role of bradykinin in chronic inflammation.
