Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, both chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders of unknown etiology characterized by a waxing and waning clinical course. For many years, the drug therapy was limited to sulfasalazine and related aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and antibiotics. Studies suggesting that the pathophysiology of these disorders relates to a disregulated, over-active immune response to indigenous bacteria have led to the increasing importance of immunosuppressive drugs for the therapy of IBD. This review details the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of these agents.
