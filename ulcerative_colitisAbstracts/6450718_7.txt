The serum concentrations of the complement inactivators C1INH, C3bINA and beta 1H have been determined in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and their correlation with C3 and properdin factor B examined. The incidence of immunoconglutinins (1K) in these patients was investigated. Raised serum concentrations of C1INH and C3bINA have been found in patients with active disease, but no significant alteration was found in serum concentration of beta 1H. An increasing incidence of positive 1K titres was found with increased length of disease history. These results suggest continuing complement activation in these diseases.
