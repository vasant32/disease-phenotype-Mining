 AIM: To examine the influence of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene polymorphism in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 131 patients with UC and 106 healthy controls for DNA extraction. We determined LPL gene polymorphisms affecting the enzyme at Ser447stop, as well as Hind III and Pvu II polymorphisms using PCR techniques. PCR products were characterized by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. Polymorphisms were examined for association with clinical features in UC patients. Genotype frequencies for LPL polymorphisms were also compared between UC patients and controls. RESULTS: In patients with onset at age 20 years or younger, C/G and G/G genotypes for Ser447stop polymorphism were more prevalent than C/C genotype (OR = 3.13, 95% CI = 0.95-10.33). Patients with H(+/-) or H(-/-) genotype for Hind III polymorphism also were more numerous than those with H(+/+) genotype (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 0.85-7.45). In the group with H(+/+) genotype for Hind III polymorphism, more patients had serum triglyceride concentrations over 150 mg/dL than patients with H(+/-) or H(-/-) genotype (P < 0.01, OR = 6.46, 95% CI = 1.39-30.12). Hypertriglycemia was also more prevalent in patients with P(+/+) genotypes for Pvu II polymorphism (P < 0.05, OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.06-8.50). Genotype frequency for LPL polymorphism did not differ significantly between UC patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Ser447stop and Hind III LPL polymorphisms may influence age of onset of UC, while Hind III and Pvu II polymorphisms influence serum triglyceride in UC patients.
