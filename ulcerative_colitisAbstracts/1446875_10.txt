Extracolonic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are common and diverse. Cardiac complications, however, are rare and of these pericarditis is the most frequently described association. A 57 year old man with a 20 year history of ulcerative colitis presented with a four day history of retrosternal chest pain and exertional dyspnoea. Electrocardiogram showed Wenckebach atrioventricular block. Three days later he developed bloody diarrhoea and sigmoidoscopy showed active proctocolitis. He was treated with oral prednisolone after which the chest pain and diarrhoea settled within 48 hours. At outpatient review two weeks later he was completely well and the electrocardiogram had returned to normal.
