We report a mucinous adenocarcinoma arising in an ileostomy stoma of a 60 year old woman after a subtotal colectomy done 28 years previously for ulcerative colitis. A study of the histochemical profiles of the mucin within the mucosa of the ileostomy and the carcinoma was undertaken. Previously documented cases are reviewed.
