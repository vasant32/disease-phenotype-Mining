An immunoperoxidase technique was used to demonstrate carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in sections of proctocolectomy specimens from nine cases of ulcerative colitis in some of which carcinoma and premalignant change had developed. Carcinoma and premalignant change stained positively for CEA in contrast with benign mucosa, whether or not inflammatory dysplasia was present.
