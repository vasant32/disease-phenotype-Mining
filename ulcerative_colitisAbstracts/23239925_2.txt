AIM: To study the polymorphisms of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile and TLR2 gene Arg753Gln, Arg677Trp and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the Zhuang population from Guangxi, China. METHODS: A case-control study was performed from February 2007 to October 2011 which included 146 Zhuang patients with IBD in the experimental group and 164 healthy Zhuang subjects who acted as the control group. All patients and healthy subjects were from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. Genomic DNA was extracted from intestinal tissue by the phenol chloroform method. TLR4 gene Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile and TLR2 gene Arg753Gln, Arg677Trp were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: The TLR4 gene Asp299Gly was digested using Nco I restriction enzyme, and a single band of 249 bp was observed which showed that it was a wild type (AA). The TLR4 gene Thr399Ile was digested using Hinf Irestriction enzyme and only the wild type (CC) was detected. In addition, the TLR2 gene Arg677Trp was digested using Aci I restriction enzyme and only the wild type (CC) was detected. The TLR2 gene Arg753Gln was digested using Pst I restriction enzyme. Only the wild type (GG) as a single band of 254 bp was observed during RFLP. Overall, no heterozygous or homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism mutations were found in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis both in the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile and the TLR2 gene Arg677Trp, Arg753Gln in the Zhuang population from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. CONCLUSION: The TLR4 gene Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile and TLR2 gene Arg753Gln, Arg677Trp polymorphisms may not be associated with IBD in the Zhuang population from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China.
