AIM: To investigate serum levels of homocysteine (Hcys) and the risk that altered levels carry for thrombosis development in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: 55 UC patients and 45 healthy adults were included. Hcys, vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were measured in both groups. Clinical history and thromboembolic events were investigated. RESULTS: The average Hcys level in the UC patients was 13.3 +/- 1.93 micromol/L (range 4.60-87) and was higher than the average Hcys level of the control group which was 11.2 +/- 3.58 micromol/L (range 4.00-20.8) (P < 0.001). Vitamin B12 and folic acid average values were also lower in the UC group (P < 0.001). When multivariate regression analysis was performed, it was seen that folic acid deficiency was the only risk factor for hyperhomocysteinemia. Frequencies of thromboembolic complications were not statistically significantly different in UC and control groups. When those with and without a thrombosis history in the UC group were compared according to Hcys levels, it was seen that there were no statistically significant differences. A negative linear relationship was found between folic acid levels and Hcys. CONCLUSION: We could not find any correlations between Hcys levels and history of prior thromboembolic events.
