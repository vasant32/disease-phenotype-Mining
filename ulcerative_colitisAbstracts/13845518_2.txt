It has been suggested that ulcerative colitis might be associated with excessive production of histamine released locally from mast cells. These cells also contain a proteolytic enzyme, leucine aminopeptidase, which might also be released at the same time if this hypothesis were correct. The studies reported do not invalidate this concept of aetiology in ulcerative colitis but provide no positive evidence in support of it.
