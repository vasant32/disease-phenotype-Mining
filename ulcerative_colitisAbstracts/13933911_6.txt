In this series a very large therapeutic dose of corticosteroid was administered by retention enemata. For the first week the author gave the equivalent of between 300 and 750 mg. of cortisone daily and for the next three weeks 150 to 375 mg. daily. The results were excellent but systemic effects were noted in all who received more than the smallest dose used.
