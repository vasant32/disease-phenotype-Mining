Immunoglobulin-contained cells in the rectal mucosa of patients suffering from non-specific inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were counted and compared with those in a control population. While the numbers of IgA, IgM, and IgG-containing cells in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease did not differ from normal, both disease groups exhibited a marked increase in IgE-staining cells. This increase in IgE-cells did not correlate with severity, duration, or treatment of disease and it did not prove possible, using these immunological studies, to differentiate between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
