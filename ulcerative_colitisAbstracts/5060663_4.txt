Following resections for ulcerative colitis and granulomatous enteritis there is a significant rise in serum IgM levels. The rise seen in IgM following resection does not occur after bypass surgery. No consistent changes were noted in the concentrations of IgA or IgG. There was no observed difference noted between patients with ulcerative colitis and granulomatous enteritis in the IgM response following resection. The results resemble those which occur after the surgical removal of an allograft which is in process of being rejected.
