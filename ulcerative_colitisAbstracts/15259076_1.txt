 AIM: To explore the pathophysiological significance of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in mouse gastrointestinal tract induced by an allergen 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). METHODS: BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control and DTH(1-6) groups. After sensitized by DNCB smeared on the abdominal skin, the mice were challenged with DNCB by gavage or enema. The weight, stool viscosity and hematochezia were observed and accumulated as disease active index (DAI) score; the gastrointestinal motility was represented by active charcoal propulsion rate; the colon pathological score was achieved by macropathology and HE staining of section prepared for microscopy; and the leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LMIF) activity was determined by indirect capillary assay of the absorbance (A) of migrated leukocytes. RESULTS: Active charcoal propulsion rates of small intestine in the DNCB gavages groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). The DAI scores and pathological score in DNCB enema groups were also higher than that in the control group (P<0.05), and there were significant rises in LMIF activity in DNCB enema groups as compared with control groups (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Mouse gastrointestinal DTH reaction could be induced by DNCB, which might facilitate the mechanism underlying the ulcerative colitis.
