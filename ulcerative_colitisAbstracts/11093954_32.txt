Although substance P (SP) has been implicated as a mediator of neurogenic inflammation in the small intestine, little information is available regarding the role of SP in the pathogenesis of chronic ulcerative colitis. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether the intraperitoneal administration of a nonpeptide neurokinin-1 (NK-1) antagonist, CP-96345, which antagonizes the binding of SP to its NK-1 receptor, results in the attenuation of colonic inflammation induced in rats by 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 10 days compared with an inactive enantiomer, CP-96344. Disease activity was assessed daily for 10 days, after which colonic tissue damage was scored and myeloperoxidase activity and colon and urinary 8-isoprostanes were measured. Animals receiving DSS exhibited marked physical signs of colitis by day 5 compared with controls. Chronic administration of the NK-1 antagonist significantly reduced the disease activity index, mucosal myeloperoxidase activity, colonic tissue damage score, and mucosal and urinary levels of 8-isoprostanes compared with inactive enantiomer- or vehicle-injected (saline) animals receiving DSS alone. These data indicate that the administration of an NK-1 antagonist can attenuate colonic inflammation and oxidative stress and suggest a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis.
