Background and Aims. To explore the association of magnifying endoscopic (ME) findings with histopathology and relapse in ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods. Forty-six patients with UC underwent ME with narrow band imaging (NBI) and crystal violet staining and were followed for more than 12 months. ME findings with vital staining were classified into ME-A, regular arrangement of round to oval pits; ME-B, irregular arrangement with/without enlarged spaces between even pits; ME-C, irregular pits in size and shape with more irregular arrangement of pits; and ME-D, disrupted or disappeared pits. NBI-guided ME features of microvascular pattern (MVP) were divided into the MVP-regular and MVP-irregular type. Results. There were 5, 24, 10, and 7 cases of ME-A, ME-B, ME-C, and ME-D grade, respectively, while there were 21 and 25 of MVP-regular and MVP-irregular type, respectively. ME classifications were significantly associated with Matts endoscopic grade. ME classifications and MVP types were significantly associated with each pathognomonic microscopic feature of severe mucosal inflammation, crypt abscess, and goblet cell depletion. There were significant differences in the percentages of remission among ME classifications and between MVP types. Conclusion. ME findings can be predictive of relapse in UC and reliable for in vivo histopathological assessment.
