AIM: To study the levels of serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), plasma D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the potential clinical significance. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with IBD and 30 healthy controls were included in this study. The concentration of sICAM-1 was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the level of D-lactate and DAO was measured by spectroscopic analysis, and the number of white blood cells (WBC) was determined by routine procedure. RESULTS: The levels of sICAM-l, DAO, and WBC in IBD patients were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.01). sICAM-l in IBD patients was found to be closely related to the levels of DAO and D-lactate (212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 6.35 +/- 2.35, P = 0.000), DAO 212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 8.65 +/- 3.54, P = 0.000) and WBC (212.94 +/- 69.89 vs 7.40 +/- 2.61, P = 0.000), but no significant difference was observed between patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with Crohn's disease. The post-treatment levels of sICAM-l, D-lactate and WBC were significantly lower than before treatment (sICAM-l 206.57 +/- 79.21 vs 146.21 +/- 64.43, P = 0.000), (D-lactate 1.46 +/- 0.94 vs 0.52 +/- 0.32, P = 0.000) and (WBC 7.24 +/- 0.2.33 vs 5.21 +/- 3.21, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: sICAM-1, D-lactate and DAO are closely related to the specific conditions of IBD, and thus could be used as a major diagnostic index.
