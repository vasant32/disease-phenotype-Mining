BACKGROUND: The incidence of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), has been increasing in Asia. We probed the nationwide registered database to assess the incidence, prevalence, gender distribution, age of diagnosis and the survival status of IBD patients in Taiwan. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the registered database compiled by the National Health Insurance provided by the Department of Health, Taiwan, from January 1998 through December 2008. RESULTS: A total of 1591 IBD patients were registered from 1998 to 2008 in Taiwan (CD: 385; UC: 1206). The incidence of CD increased from 0.19/100,000 in 1998 to 0.24/100,000 in 2008. The incidence of UC increased from 0.61/100,000 in 1998 to 0.94/100,000 in 2008. The prevalence of CD increased from 0.19/100,000 in 1998 to 1.78/100,000 in 2008. The prevalence of UC increased from 0.61/100,000 in 1998 to 7.62/100,000 in 2008. Male to female ratio for CD was 2.22 and 1.64 for UC. Age of registered for CD was predominantly between 20 to 39, and for UC between 30 to 49Â years of age. The standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 4.97 (3.72-6.63) for CD and 1.78 (1.46-2.17) for UC, from 1998 to 2008 in Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Taiwan nationwide database for IBD, the incidence and prevalence of IBD in Taiwan significantly increased from 1998 to 2008. The mortality rate was higher for CD patients than UC patients, and both were higher than the general population.
