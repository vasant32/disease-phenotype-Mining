 AIM: To investigate the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion on epithelial cell apoptosis and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins in rat ulcerative colitis. METHODS: A rat model of ulcerative colitis was established by immunological methods and local stimulation. All rats were randomly divided into model control group (MC), electro-acupuncture group (EA), herbs-partition moxibustion group (HPM). Normal rats were used as normal control group (NC). Epithelial cell apoptosis and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins were detected by TUNEL and immunohistochemical method respectively. RESULTS: The number of epithelial cell apoptosis in MC was significantly higher than that in NC, and was markedly decreased after the treatment with herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL in colonic epithelial cells in MC was higher than that in NC, and was markedly down- regulated by herbs-partition moxibustion or electro-acupuncture treatment. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis in rats involves abnormality of apoptosis. Acupuncture and moxibustion can regulate the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, fas and FasL proteins and inhibit the apoptosis of epithelial cells of ulcerative colitis in rats by Bcl-2/Bax, fas/FasL pathways.
