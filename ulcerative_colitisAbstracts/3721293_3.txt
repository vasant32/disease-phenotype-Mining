The effect of alpha-tocopherylquinone (alpha-TQ) and a low fat diet on a patient with chronic continuous ulcerative colitis was described. The patient's condition improved dramatically with both colonic and extraintestinal manifestations of the disease greatly reduced with doses of alpha-TQ of 3.0 g/day (50 mg/kg/d) or greater. Withdrawal of alpha-TQ for periods of one to two days produced recurrence of inflammation which was again reduced upon re-introduction of alpha-TQ.
