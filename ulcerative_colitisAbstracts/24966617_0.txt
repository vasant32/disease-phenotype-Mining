AIM: To explore the association of MYO9B gene polymorphisms with clinical phenotypes and intestinal permeability of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China. METHODS: A total of 442 IBD patients and 402 healthy volunteers were genotyped for two single nucleotides (rs962917 and rs1545620) using the ligase detection reaction and polymerase chain reaction. Allelic and genotype frequency analyses were performed for the two groups. Intestinal permeability was evaluated using lactulose (L) and mannitol (M) excretion. The association of MYO9B gene polymorphisms with intestinal permeability between the normal and high intestinal permeability groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of MYO9B between IBD patients and controls. Although no association was found with ulcerative colitis in the comparison between the subgroups, the frequencies of rs962917 and rs1545620 were different in the Crohn's disease (CD) subgroup with ileocolitis (CC vs CT and TT, P = 0.014; and AA vs AC and CC, P = 0.022, respectively). rs1545620 variants appear to be the genetic susceptibility factor for perianal disease in CD patients (AA vs AC CC, P = 0.029). In addition, the L/M ratio was significantly higher in IBD patients than in controls (0.065 ± 0.013 vs 0.020 ± 0.002, P = 0.02), but no association was found between the MYO9B gene and the L/M ratio in IBD patients. CONCLUSION: MYO9B gene polymorphisms may influence the sub-phenotypic expression of CD in China. No association between these MYO9B polymorphisms and intestinal permeability in IBD patients was found.
