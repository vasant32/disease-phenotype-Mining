 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although regenerating gene (REG) Ialpha protein may be involved in the inflammation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract, its pathophysiological role in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the resulting colitic cancer remains unclear. We investigated expression of the REG Ialpha gene and its protein in UC and colitic cancer tissues. We examined whether cytokines are responsible for REG Ialpha gene expression and whether REG Ialpha protein has a trophic and/or an antiapoptotic effect on colon cancer cells. METHODS: Expression of REG Ialpha mRNA and its gene product in UC tissues was analysed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The effects of cytokines on REG Ialpha promoter activity were examined in LoVo cells by luciferase reporter assay. The effects of REG Ialpha protein on growth and H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis were examined in LoVo cells by MTT and TUNEL assays, respectively. RESULTS: REG Ialpha protein was strongly expressed in inflamed epithelium and in dysplasias and cancerous lesions in UC tissues. The level of REG Ialpha mRNA expression in UC tissues correlated significantly with severity of inflammation and disease duration. REG Ialpha promoter activity was enhanced by stimulation with interferon gamma or interleukin 6. REG Ialpha protein promoted cell growth and conferred resistance to H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis in LoVo cells. REG Ialpha protein promoted Akt phosphorylation and enhanced Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression in LoVo cells. CONCLUSIONS: The REG Ialpha gene is inducible by cytokines and its gene product may function as a mitogenic and/or an antiapoptotic factor in the UC-colitic cancer sequence.
