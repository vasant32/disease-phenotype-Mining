AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) prospectively in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients intolerant or refractory to conventional medical therapy. METHODS: Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis/IBD unclassified (UC/IBDU) patients intolerant or refractory to conventional medical therapy received MMF (500-2000 mg bid). Clinical response was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw index (HBI) or colitis activity index (CAI) after 2, 6 and 12 mo of therapy, as were steroid usage and adverse effects. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (9 CD/5 UC/IBDU; 8M/6F; mean age 50.4 years, range 28-67 years) were treated and prospectively assessed for their response to oral MMF. Of the 11 patients who were not in remission on commencing MMF, 7/11 (63.6%) achieved remission by 8 wk. All 3 patients in remission on commencing MMF maintained their remission. Ten patients were still on MMF at 6 mo with 9/14 (64.3%) in remission, while of 12 patients followed for 12 mo, 8 were in remission without dose escalation (66.7%). Three patients were withdrawn from the MMF due to drug intolerance. There were no serious adverse events attributed due to the medication. CONCLUSION: MMF demonstrated efficacy in the management of difficult IBD. MMF appeared safe, well tolerated and efficacious for both short and long-term therapy, without the need for dose escalation. Further evaluation of MMF comparing it to conventional immunosuppressants is required.
