Gastrointestinal Kaposi's sarcoma is a well described and usually asymptomatic manifestation of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We report a patient who had extensive colonic Kaposi's sarcoma and presented with an ulcerative colitis like illness. Total colectomy was subsequently required as an emergency procedure for toxic megacolon. The patient remains well on maintenance interferon therapy 21 months after surgery.
