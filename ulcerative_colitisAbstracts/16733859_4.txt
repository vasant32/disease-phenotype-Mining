 AIM: To assess the prevalence and clinical value of p-ANCA in a sample of Mexican ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. METHODS: In a prospective, IRB-approved protocol, p-ANCA was determined in 80 patients with UC (mean age, 32 +/- 12.9 years). The severity and extension of disease were determined by clinical methods, searching a statistical association with p-ANCA status. RESULTS: p-ANCA were detected in 41 (51%) patients. Severity of disease was the only clinical variable statistically associated with their presence (P < 0.0001; OR = 9; CI 95% = 3.2-24.7). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of p-ANCA was similar to that reported in other countries. Their presence was associated to UC severity, but offered no more information than the obtained by clinical methods.
