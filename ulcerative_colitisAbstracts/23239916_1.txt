The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic relapsing, remitting disorders. Diagnosis, along with assessment of disease activity and prognosis present challenges to managing clinicians. Faecal biomarkers, such as faecal calprotectin, are a non-invasive method which can be used to aid these decisions. Calprotectin is a calcium and zinc binding protein found in the cytosol of human neutrophils and macrophages. It is released extracellularly in times of cell stress or damage and can be detected within faeces and thus can be used as a sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation. Faecal calprotectin has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of IBD, correlates with mucosal disease activity and can help to predict response to treatment or relapse. With growing evidence supporting its use, over the last decade this faecal biomarker has significantly changed the way IBD is managed.
