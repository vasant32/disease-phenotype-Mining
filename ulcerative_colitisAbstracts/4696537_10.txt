In a review of 103 patients with carcinoma of the proximal bile ducts, eight patients were noted to have had ulcerative colitis also. This finding is strongly suggestive of a specific association between the two diseases. In three of the patients, carcinoma developed several years after proctocolectomy. Seven of the eight patients were significantly younger than the median age of the group as a whole, but no other apparent difference was noted between those with ulcerative colitis and the remainder of the group.
