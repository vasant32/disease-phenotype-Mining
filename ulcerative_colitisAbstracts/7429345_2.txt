We report two cases of pan-proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis who some time postoperatively developed an obstructive uropathy with the clinical and radiological features of retroperitoneal fibrosis. The incidence of this complication appears to be around 10% and the possibility of such a diagnosis should be borne in mind in any patient who has non-specific symptoms after surgery for ulcerative colitis.
