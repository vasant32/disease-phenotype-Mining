BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is controversy regarding whether paramyxovirus infection is causally associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The latest cohort study claimed that atypical measles and mumps infections in childhood may be risk factors for later IBD. This study was conducted to clarify the validity of a causal link between persistent mumps virus infection and IBD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: (1) Amplification of the mumps virus genome was performed in both intestinal specimens (ulcerative colitis 15, Crohn's disease 15, control 10) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) (ulcerative colitis seven, Crohn's disease six, control three) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern hybridisation using primers specific to the viral genome encoding phosphoprotein or haemagglutinin-neuraminidase. (2) Titre of serum antimumps IgG was measured in 16 patients with ulcerative colitis, in 16 patients with Crohn's disease, and in 16 normal controls using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: (1) The mumps virus genome was not detected by RT-PCR in intestinal specimens or PBL in any case. (2) Antimumps IgG titre was positive in 7/16 ulcerative colitis, 10/16 Crohn's disease, and 11/16 control specimens. The mean (SEM) titre of antimumps IgG was 12.281 (7.831) in ulcerative colitis, 7.675 (1.608) in Crohn's disease, and 8.637 (1.969) in controls, with no significant difference between the three groups. CONCLUSION: We could not find any evidence to support a causal link between persistent mumps virus infection and IBD.
