AIM: To investigate the association of procalcitonin (PCT) with ulcerative colitis (UC) activity. METHODS: Serum PCT levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the white blood cell count were analyzed in 18 patients with UC and 11 healthy volunteers. Serum PCT levels were analyzed by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Severity assessments were based on Truelove and Witts' severity index. Correlation of serum PCT and CRP levels with UC activity was examined. Moreover, we assessed serum PCT and CRP levels in patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore. RESULTS: Serum PCT levels in severe UC patients (n = 7) (0.096 ± 0.034 ng/mL) were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate UC patients (n = 11) (0.033 ± 0.012 ng/mL) and healthy volunteers (n = 11) (0.035 ± 0.005 ng/mL) (P = 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, there was no difference in serum PCT levels between mild-to-moderate UC patients and healthy volunteers. Interestingly, patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points displayed significantly increased levels of serum PCT (0.075 ± 0.043 ng/mL) compared with patients with a subscore of 2 points (0.03 ± 0.011 ng/mL) (P = 0.0302). Moreover, CRP levels in patients with severe UC or a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points were not significantly higher than in patients with mild-to-moderate UC or a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 3 points. CONCLUSION: Serum PCT levels were significantly correlated with UC activity.
