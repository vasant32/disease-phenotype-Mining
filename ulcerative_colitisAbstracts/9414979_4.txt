BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis develops in 3-10% of patients with ulcerative colitis, and may be associated with an increased cancer risk. Ulcerative colitis is probably less common in people of African origin than in populations of European descent. AIMS AND METHODS: To review the records of all patients under regular follow up for ulcerative colitis at St Bartholomew's Hospital (London, UK), a tertiary referral centre, prompted by discovering a cluster of cases with common features. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among 166 patients with ulcerative colitis under regular follow up, only four (all women) are of African or Caribbean genetic origin, and three of these have developed sclerosing cholangitis within three years of presentation with colitis, compared with four of 162 patients of European or Asian descent (odds ratio 119, 95% confidence interval 8-3837; p = 0.0002). This cluster, which is not explained by common HLA DR or DQ type, suggests that Africans and Afro-Caribbeans, especially women, may be at increased risk of sclerosing cholangitis. This may reflect genetic influences on the development of enteric and hepatobiliary inflammatory disease.
