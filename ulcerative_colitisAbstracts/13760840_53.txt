Two consecutive trials of out-patient treatment for mild cases of active ulcerative colitis are described. In the first trial oral prednisone gave significantly better results than a placebo. In the second trial "salazopyrin" gave final results approaching those of prednisone, although over a longer time and with a higher incidence of unpleasant side-effects, but topical hydrocortisone gave disappointing results, probably because the technique of administration was not suitable for ordinary out-patient use.
