Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiology of IBD is probably the result of the complex interaction of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences. There is a well-known risk of thrombosis in patients with IBD. We present the case of a 53-year-old man with ulcerative colitis, who spontaneously developed intracranial sinus thrombosis that was treated with low molecular weight heparin. Literature was searched to assess the frequency and characteristics of cerebral sinus thrombosis in IBD and the role of certain etiopathological factors in such thrombotic patients.
