 AIM: To evaluate the protective effects of ilomastat, an exogenous matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, on trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNB)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. METHODS: Male SD rats were randomly divided into model group, protective groups A and B, and normal control group. Rats in the model group received only intra-colonic TNB. Rats in the protective groups A and B received intra-peritoneal ilomastat of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, beside TNB. Rats in the normal control group received only intra-colonic normal saline. After 3 wk, segments of colon were obtained. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used for pathological study. RESULTS: The model of UC was successfully induced in rats. Inflammation of colonic mucosa greatly improved in protective groups A and B. Expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in the model group, protective groups A and B was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (P < 0.0001) with MMP-1 expression increased more significantly than TIMP-1 expression. Expression of MMP-1 in protective groups A and B was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.0001) . Expression of MMP-1 in protective group B was significantly lower than that in protective group A (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Ilomastat improves TNB-induced UC in rats by inhibiting the MMP-1 activity.
