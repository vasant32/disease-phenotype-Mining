Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in man, are complex diseases in which genetic and environmental factors interact to promote an excessive mucosal immune response directed against normal components of the bacterial microflora. There is also evidence that the pathologic process is due to defects in counter-regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving the immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Indeed, studies in human IBD tissues and murine models of colitis have documented a disruption of TGF-β1 signalling marked by a block in the phosphorylation of Smad3, a signalling molecule associated with the activated TGF-β receptor, due to up-regulation of Smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation. Knock-down of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling, thus resulting in a marked suppression of inflammatory cytokine production and attenuation of murine colitis. These findings together with the demonstration that Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide is not toxic when administered in mice have paved the way for the development of a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide-based pharmaceutical compound that is now ready to enter the clinics. In this article we review the available data supporting the pathogenic role of Smad7 in IBD and discuss whether and how Smad7 antisense therapy could help dampen the ongoing inflammation in IBD.
