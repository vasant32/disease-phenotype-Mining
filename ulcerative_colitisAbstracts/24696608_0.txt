This is a review of the characteristic findings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and their usefulness in the diagnosis of sclerosing cholangitis. PSC is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by idiopathic fibrous obstruction and is frequently associated with IBD. IBD-associated with PSC (PSC-IBD) shows an increased incidence of pancolitis, mild symptoms, and colorectal malignancy. Although an increased incidence of pancolitis is a characteristic finding, some cases are endoscopically diagnosed as right-sided ulcerative colitis. Pathological studies have revealed that inflammation occurs more frequently in the right colon than the left colon. The frequency of rectal sparing and backwash ileitis should be investigated in a future study based on the same definition. The cholangiographic findings of immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) are similar to those of PSC. The rare association between IBD and IgG4-SC and the unique characteristics of PSC-IBD are useful findings for distinguishing PSC from IgG4-SC.
