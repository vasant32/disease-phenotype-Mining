Current gastroenterological opinion is that colonoscopy provides the most accurate technique for diagnosing structural colonic disease, especially neoplasia. A strong case has been made for continuing colonoscopic surveillance of patients with neoplastic polyps, chronic ulcerative colitis, and after resection of carcinomas. The incidence of these diseases is known, and calculations can be made of the desirable frequency of colonoscopy. These indicate that about 160 colonoscopies per 100,000 population per year are required. At present facilities in the United Kingdom fall well below that figure.
