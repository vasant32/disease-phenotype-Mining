Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory processes of the intestinal tract. The etiology of these diseases is currently unknown. However, inflammation is hypothesized to result from inappropriate activation of mucosal immunity by luminal antigens in genetically susceptible individuals. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of transmembrane proteins that act as microbial pattern recognition receptors. They are crucial initiators of innate immune responses. The role of TLRs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been fully elucidated. In this review, we aim to analyze the available data connecting individual TLRs to intestinal inflammation and IBD.
