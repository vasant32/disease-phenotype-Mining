Between 1947 and 1980, 67 patients with carcinoma complicating ulcerative colitis were treated at St Mark's Hospital. The tumours in these patients were compared with those in 4817 patients without colitis seen over the same period. There was a higher proportion of inoperable and high grade tumours in the colitic group but the prognosis was found to be very similar in patients with and without colitis.
