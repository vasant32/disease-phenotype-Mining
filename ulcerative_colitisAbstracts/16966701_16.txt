A 62 year old man with longstanding ulcerative colitis and previous endoscopic excision of two dysplasia associated lesions or masses (DALMs) was admitted to our endoscopy unit for evaluation and resection of other possible DALMs. He had previously been offered and refused colectomy because of comorbidity from Parkinson's disease. He had multiple polypoid and sessile lesions which were assessed using a third generation prototype narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscope with magnification. Selected lesions were either biopsied or resected with a combination of endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection techniques. We correlated the pit pattern and vascular pattern intensity seen with magnification NBI with histology of both inflammatory and dysplastic lesions. Dysplastic areas showed Kudo pit patterns II, IIIL, and IV and high vascular pattern intensity. Non-dysplastic and dysplastic areas of recurrence immediately adjacent to the scar from a previous endoscopic mucosal resection site were also assessed. This is the first case report where NBI has been shown to help in DALM detection and to distinguish dysplastic from non-dysplastic mucosa in ulcerative colitis.
