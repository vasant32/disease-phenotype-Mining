We report a case of pouchitis and pre-pouch ileitis, and inflammation in the neo-terminal ileum proximal to the pouch, developed after restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis. A 35-year old female presented with fever and abdominal pain five weeks after ileostomy closure following proctocolectomy. Computed tomography showed collection of feces in the pouch and proximal ileum. A drainage tube was placed in the pouch perianally, and purulent feces were discharged. With antibiotic treatment, her symptoms disappeared, but two weeks later, she repeatedly developed fever and abdominal pain along with anal bleeding. Pouchscopy showed mucosal inflammation in both the pouch and the pre-pouch ileum. The mucosal cytokine production was elevated in the pouch and pre-pouch ileum. With antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, her symptoms were improved along with improvement of endoscopic inflammation and decrease of mucosal cytokine production. The fecal stasis with bacterial overgrowth is the major pathogenesis of pouchitis and pre-pouch ileitis in our case.
