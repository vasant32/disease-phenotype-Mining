Carcinoma of the colon as a complication of ulcerative colitis is relatively common, whereas malignant lymphoma is apparently rare; there are approximately 20 recorded cases. We report a case of follicular lymphoma of the rectum in a 73 year old woman with a 21 year history of ulcerative colitis. In view of the possible immune basis of ulcerative colitis, it is important to report and accurately classify cases of lymphoma arising in association with it.
