AIM: To investigate the effect of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) gene therapy in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rat model. METHODS: The colitis of Sprague-Dawley rats was induced by intrarectal infusion of 1 mL 5% (v/v) acetic acid. Twenty-four hours after exposed to acetic acid, rats were divided into three experimental groups: control group, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium Ty21a strain (SP) group and SP strain carrying human KGF gene (SPK) group, and they were separately administered orally with 10% NaHCO(3), SP or SPK. Animals were sacrificed and colonic tissues were harvested respectively on day 3, 5, 7 and 10 after administration. Weights of rats, colonic weight/length ratio and stool score were evaluated. Histological changes of colonic tissues were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining method. The expression of KGF, KGF receptor (KGFR) and TNF-α were measured either by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the cellular localization of KGFR and Ki67. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the homogenate were measured. RESULTS: Body weight and colonic weight/length ratio were declined in SPK group compared with SP and control groups (body weight: 272.78 ± 17.92 g vs 243.72 ± 14.02 g and 240.68 ± 12.63 g, P < 0.01; colonic weight/length ratio: 115.76 ± 7.47 vs 150.32 ± 5.99 and 153.67 ± 5.50 mg/cm, P < 0.01). Moreover, pathological changes of damaged colon were improved in SPK group as well. After administration of SPK strain, KGF expression increased markedly from the 3rd d, and remained at a high level till the 10th d. Furthermore, KGFR expression and Ki67 expression elevated, whereas TNF-α expression was inhibited in SPK group. In the group administered with SPK, SOD activity increased significantly (d 5: 26.18 ± 5.84 vs 18.12 ± 3.30 and 18.79 ± 4.74 U/mg, P < 0.01; d 7: 35.48 ± 3.35 vs 22.57 ± 3.44 and 21.69 ± 3.94 U/mg, P < 0.01; d 10: 46.10 ± 6.23 vs 25.35 ± 4.76 and 27.82 ± 6.42 U/mg, P < 0.01) and MDA contents decreased accordingly (d 7: 7.40 ± 0.88 vs 9.81 ± 1.21 and 10.45 ± 1.40 nmol/mg, P < 0.01; d 10: 4.36 ± 0.62 vs 8.41 ± 0.92 and 8.71 ± 1.27 nmol/mg, P < 0.01), compared with SP and control groups. CONCLUSION: KGF gene therapy mediated by attenuated Salmonella ameliorates ulcerative colitis induced by acetic acids, and it may be a safe and effective treatment for ulcerative colitis.
