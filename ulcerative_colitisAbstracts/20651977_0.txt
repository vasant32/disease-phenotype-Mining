In January 2007, a 74-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for treatment of an adenoma-like dysplastic lesion (ALM). He had a four-year history of ulcerative colitis. Endoscopic findings revealed that a protruded lesion with an approximate size of 3 cm at the splenic flexure was surrounded by pseudopolyps. Lifting of the tumor was poor despite injection of normal saline around it. Therefore, the combination of endoscopic resection and heat ablation therapy with argon plasma coagulation was performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed tubular adenoma with high-grade atypia. Endoscopic examination 15 months after this treatment revealed no occurrence of ALM. Whether or not there is a possibility of local recurrence after ablation therapy in addition to endoscopic resection performed in this case remains unclear. However, this endoscopic therapy is a promising option for ALM in chronic ulcerative colitis.
