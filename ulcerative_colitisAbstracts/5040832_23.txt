The frequency of occurrence of 15 of the commoner human leucocyte antigens was determined in 18 patients with Crohn's disease and in 16 patients with ulcerative colitis, using an in-vitro lymphocyte cytotoxicity test (Harris, Wentzel, Cocking, Dodsworth, and Ukaejiofo, 1970). The overall results showed that, with the exception of human leucocyte antigen 3 in patients with Crohn's disease, in neither disease was there any major difference in any of the other antigen frequencies compared with a panel of 50 healthy controls. Nor was there an excess frequency of any particular antigen occurring in both Crohn's disease and colitis.
