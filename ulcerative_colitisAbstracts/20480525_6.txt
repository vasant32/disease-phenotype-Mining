AIM: To investigate whether narrow band imaging (NBI) is a useful tool for the in vivo detection of angiogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Conventional and NBI colonoscopy was performed in 14 patients with colonic inflammation (8 ulcerative colitis and 6 Crohn's disease). Biopsy samples were taken and CD31 expression was assayed immunohistochemically; microvascular density was assessed by vessel count. RESULTS: In areas that were endoscopically normal but positive on NBI, there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in angiogenesis (12 +/- 1 vessels/field vs 18 +/- 2 vessels/field) compared with areas negative on NBI. In addition, in areas that were inflamed on white light endoscopy and positive on NBI, there was a significant (P < 0.01) increase in vessel density (24 +/- 7 vessels/field) compared with NBI-negative areas. CONCLUSION: NBI may allow in vivo imaging of intestinal angiogenesis in IBD patients.
