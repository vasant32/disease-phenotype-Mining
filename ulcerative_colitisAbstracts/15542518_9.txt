 BACKGROUND/AIMS: The gut flora may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. An ileal reservoir or pouch can be created to replace the excised rectum after proctocolectomy. In patients with ulcerative colitis this is subject to inflammation and termed pouchitis. Using bacteria from patients the authors sought evidence for the presence rather than the identity of a pathogenic species in pouchitis, and for its absence in healthy pouches by the differential effect on lymphocyte proliferation. METHODS: An ex vivo cell culture assay was used in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells or lamina propria mononuclear cells were cultured with sterile sonicates of gut flora from patients with or without pouchitis in the presence of antigen presenting cells. RESULTS: Sonicated pouchitis flora produced a consistent and intense proliferation of the mononuclear cells but that produced by sonicates from healthy pouches was minimal (p = 0.012 or 0.018, peripheral blood or lamina propria mononuclear cells). Preparation of the sonicates with the antibiotic metronidazole abolished their stimulatory ability (p = 0.005, peripheral blood mononuclear cells). In separate assays neither direct addition of metronidazole nor of its hydroxy metabolite affected the mononuclear cells' proliferation with alternative stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly support a bacterial aetiology for pouchitis.
