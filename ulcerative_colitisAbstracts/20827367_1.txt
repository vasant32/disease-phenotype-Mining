For many years, cancer surveillance colonoscopy in ulcerative colitis patients has involved obtaining at least 30 biopsies of flat and abnormal-appearing mucosa. With the advent of better imaging techniques, biopsies can be better targeted to abnormal-appearing mucosa, thereby increasing the sensitivity of testing. Use of chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence, or confocal endomicroscopy to target biopsies is likely to improve detection of dysplasia and identification of patients at high risk for developing cancer.
