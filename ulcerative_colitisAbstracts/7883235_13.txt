A 51 year old woman with a two year history of ulcerative colitis developed a wide spread gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of low grade malignancy (MALT-lymphoma) involving upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and bone marrow. After chemotherapy, clinical symptoms improved and lymphocytic infiltrates disappeared. Thirty nine cases of ulcerative colitis and 22 cases of Crohn's disease complicated by gastrointestinal lymphomas reported in published works are reviewed. In inflammatory bowel diseases any dense lymphocytic infiltrates seen in biopsy specimens obtained from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease should be assessed to exclude gastrointestinal lymphoma.
