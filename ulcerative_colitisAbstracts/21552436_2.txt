A 36-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at the age of 17 years was referred to our hospital because of severe abdominal pain and repeated bloody diarrhea that persisted during pregnancy despite combination therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and weekly granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA). She underwent combination therapy consisting of high-dose corticosteroids, intensive GMA (two sessions per week) and vancomycin, which was used to eradicate Clostridium difficile, under total parenteral nutrition control until the estimated weight of her fetus reached 1,000 g. This combination therapy was partially successful, resulting in almost complete disappearance of abdominal pain and a marked decrease in stool frequency. However bloody diarrhea persisted and the patient developed anemia and hypoalbuminemia and was unable to prolong her gestation time. Cesarean section was conducted at 28 weeks of gestation without any congenital abnormalities or neurological defects. Oral administration of tacrolimus was begun 7 days after cesarean section, which was followed by rapid induction of remission. Corticosteroids were then gradually tapered off. Tacrolimus is one therapeutic option after cesarean section in pregnant patients who do not respond well to GMA and high-dose corticosteroids for persistent active ulcerative colitis.
