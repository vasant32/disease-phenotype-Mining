Interleukin-11 (IL-11) displays epithelial cytoprotective effects during intestinal injury. Antiapoptotic effects of IL-11 have been described, yet mechanisms remain unclear. Fas/CD95 death receptor signaling is upregulated in ulcerative colitis, leading to mucosal breakdown. We hypothesized that IL-11 inhibits Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis in intestinal epithelia. Cell death was monitored in IEC-18 cells by microscopy, caspase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and abundance of cytoplasmic oligonucleosomal DNA. RT-PCR was used to monitor Fas, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, cFLIP, survivin, and Bcl-2 family members. Fas membrane expression was detected by immunoblot. Inhibitors of JAK2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), Akt 1, MEK1 and MEK2, and p38 MAPK were used to delineate IL-11's antiapoptotic mechanisms. IL-11 did not alter Fas expression. Pretreatment with IL-11 for 24 h before FasL reduced cytoplasmic oligonucleosomal DNA by 63.2%. IL-11 also attenuated caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage without affecting expression of activated caspase-8 p20 or cytochrome c release. IL-11 did not affect mRNA expression of the candidate antiapoptotic genes. The MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors U-0126 and PD-98059 significantly attenuated the protection of IL-11 against caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage and cytoplasmic oligonucleosomal DNA accumulation. Although Akt inhibition reversed IL-11-mediated effects on caspase cleavage, it did not reverse the protective effects of IL-11 by DNA ELISA. We conclude that IL-11-dependent MEK1 and MEK2 signaling inhibits FasL-induced apoptosis. The lack of reversal of the IL-11 effect on DNA cleavage by Akt inhibition, despite antagonism of caspase cleavage, suggests that IL-11 inhibits caspase-independent cell death signaling by FasL in a MEK-dependent manner.
