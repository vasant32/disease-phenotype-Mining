THE COLORECTAL MUCOSA INCLUDES TWO QUANTITATIVELY, STRUCTURALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DISSIMILAR AREAS: one, built with columnar and goblet cells, covers the vast majority of the mucosa, and the other consists of scattered minute gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The overwhelming majority of colorectal carcinomas evolve in GALT-free mucosal areas and very rarely in GALT aggregates. Remarkably, the colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) displays a high number of newly formed GALT-aggregates. The patient here described is a 68-year-old female with a history of UC since 1984. At surveillance colonoscopy in 2012, one of two detected polyps was a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. Beneath this adenoma, a well-circumscribed GALT sheltering a carcinoma was found. Serial sections revealed no connection between the villous adenoma and the GALT-carcinoma. The GALT-carcinoma here reported seems to have evolved in a newly formed, UC-dependent, GALT complex. This notion is substantiated by the fact that 27% or 4 out of the 15 cases of GALT-carcinomas in the colon reported in the literature (including the present case) evolved in patients with UC.
