Recent studies have shown that mucosal serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) expression is decreased in animal models of colitis, as well as in the colonic mucosa of humans with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Altered SERT function or expression may underlie the altered motility, secretion, and sensation seen in these inflammatory gut disorders. In an effort to elucidate possible mediators of SERT downregulation, we treated cultured colonic epithelial cells (Caco2) with conditioned medium from activated human lymphocytes. Application of the conditioned medium caused a decrease in fluoxetine-sensitive [(3)H]5-HT uptake. Individual proinflammatory agents were then tested for their ability to affect uptake. Cells were treated for 48 or 72 h with PGE(2) (10 microM), IFN-gamma (500 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml), IL-12 (50 ng/ml), or the nitric oxide-releasing agent S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; 100 microM). [(3)H]5-HT uptake was then measured. Neither PGE nor IL-12 had any effect on [(3)H]5-HT uptake, and GSNO increased uptake. However, after 3-day incubation, both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma elicited significant decreases in SERT function. Neither TNF-alpha nor IFN-gamma were cytotoxic when used for this period of time and at these concentrations. These two cytokines also induced decreases in SERT mRNA and protein levels. By altering SERT expression, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma could contribute to the altered motility and expression seen in vivo in ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel syndrome.
