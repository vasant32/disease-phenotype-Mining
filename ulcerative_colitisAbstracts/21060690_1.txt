Drugs are a rare cause of pancreatitis. Whereas some drugs are well known to induce an attack of pancreatitis, some people may be more prone to develop pancreatitis because of personal susceptibility. We describe a recurrent case of acute pancreatitis after administration of several drugs in a patient with intestinal inflammatory bowel disease that needed to be treated with subsequent antiinflammatory agents. Genetic mutation in the CFTR gene was found in the patient that led us to postulate that CFTR was a trigger for drug-induced acute pancreatitis. In conclusion, genetic analysis should be advised in case of recurrent pancreatitis in patient with intestinal inflammatory bowel disease.
