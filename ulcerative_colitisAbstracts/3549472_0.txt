The colonic faecal and mucosal associated bacterial populations of five patients with ulcerative colitis and four control patients were studied in detail to assess their ability to produce IgA1-proteases. A total of 330 bacterial strains were isolated from the patients with ulcerative colitis and IgA1-protease activity was unable to be reliably shown in any. It is therefore unlikely that such enzyme production by colonic bacteria plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.
