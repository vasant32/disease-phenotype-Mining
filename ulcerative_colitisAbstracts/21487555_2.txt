Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition representing one of the most distinct extraintestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PG occurs independently from intestinal disease activity in about 1-2% of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and is characterized by chronic deep skin ulcers whose exact pathogenesis is still unknown. So far, patients with ulcerative colitis have only been reported to develop PG during the course of IBD but not at the initial manifestation of bowel symptoms. This is the first report demonstrating the simultaneous onset of ulcerative colitis and severe multifocal PG. In addition, we provide first evidence that infliximab may have a particularly powerful effect in early disseminated PG compared to late-onset PG, advocating an early application of this drug.
