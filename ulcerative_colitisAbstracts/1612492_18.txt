Fluticasone propionate is a new corticosteroid with low systemic bioavailability. This study reports the outcome of a double blind clinical trial comparing oral fluticasone propionate (5 mg four times daily) with placebo for the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis. Sixty patients were treated for four weeks, with assessments at two and four weeks. One patient was withdrawn when she was found to have amoebiasis. Thus, results are presented for 29 patients who received placebo and 30 who received fluticasone propionate. The two groups were well matched for age, sex, length of history, and extent of disease. After four weeks of therapy the clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological responses were similar in the two groups. It is concluded that fluticasone propionate (5 mg four times daily) is not effective treatment for active distal ulcerative colitis.
