 AIM: To investigate the clinical significance of mucosal expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3 in human ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Biopsy specimens for histological analysis and mRNA detection were obtained endoscopically from the rectum of 62 patients with UC (36 men; age 13-76 years). The patients were classified endoscopically according to Matts' grade (grade 1 to 4). Expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNAs was quantified in samples by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). GAPDH was used as an internal control for efficiency of RT-PCR and amount of RNA. RESULTS: SOCS3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in inflamed mucosa of UC than in inactive mucosa. The level of expression was well correlated with the degree of both endoscopic and histologic inflammation. Interestingly, among the patients in remission, the group with relatively low expression of SOCS3 showed a higher rate of remission maintenance over a 12-mo period. In contrast, SOCS1 mRNA was expressed in both inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa and was not correlated with the activity of colonic mucosa or prognosis. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that increased expression of mucosal SOCS3, but not of SOCS1, may play a critical role in the development of the colonic inflammation of UC.
