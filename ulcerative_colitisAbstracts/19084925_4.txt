5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine) rarely induces hypersensitivity reactions. If chest pain associated with atypical electrocardiographic changes are seen during its administration, one should always bear in mind type I variant of Kounis syndrome. This variant includes patients, of any age, with normal coronary arteries, without predisposing factors for coronary artery disease, in whom the acute release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells can induce either sudden coronary artery narrowing, without increase of cardiac enzymes and troponins, or coronary artery spasm that progresses to acute myocardial infarction, with elevated cardiac enzymes and troponins.
