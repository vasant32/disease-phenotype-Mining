Prostaglandin E2-like activity was determined in peripheral venous blood of control subjects and in patients with acute gastroenteritis and active ulcerative colitis, using a bioassay method. No significant diurnal variations of prostaglandin levels were detected in the control group, while significantly raised venous plasma prostaglandin-like activity was detected in acute gastroenteritis and in active ulcerative colitis.
