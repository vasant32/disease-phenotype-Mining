Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) following total proctocolectomy has become the surgical treatment of choice for ulcerative colitis patients who have medically refractory disease or neoplasia. Unfortunately, various metabolic complications have been reported with this surgical procedure, including anemia, vitamin B(12) deficiency, bile salt and fat malabsorption, vitamin D deficiency, bone loss, and nephrolithiasis. Recognition and early diagnosis of these complications are important when managing IPAA patients.
