The pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear, but enhancement of disease activity by usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suggests involvement of prostanoid in its pathophysiology. However, biological effect of prostaglandin (PG) D(2) on intestinal inflammation remains unknown. We investigated the expression of enzymes for PGD(2) synthesis, prostaglandin D synthase (PGDS), and its relation to the activity of colitis in UC patients. The role of lipocalin-type PGDS (L-PGDS) using a murine colitis model was also assessed. Tissue samples were obtained by colonic biopsies from patients with UC. Expression levels of mRNAs for L-PGDS and hematopoietic-type PGDS were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. COX-2 and L-PGDS expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Localization of L-PGDS expression was also determined by in situ hybridization. In experimental study, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate in the drinking water to induce colitis. The degree of colonic inflammation was compared with L-PGDS(-/-) mice and control mice. The level of L-PGDS mRNA expression was increased in UC patients in parallel with disease activity. Colocalization of L-PGDS and cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 was observed in lamina proprial infiltrating cells and muscularis mucosa in UC patients. The level of hematopoietic PGDS mRNA expression did not differ from control mucosa. Dextran sodium sulfate treatment to L-PGDS(-/-) mice showed lower disease activity than control mice. We reported for the first time the presence of L-PGDS in the COX-2-expressing cells in the mucosa of active UC patients and that only L-PGDS increased with disease activity. An animal model study suggests that PGD(2) derived from L-PGDS-expressing cells plays proinflammatory roles in colitis.
