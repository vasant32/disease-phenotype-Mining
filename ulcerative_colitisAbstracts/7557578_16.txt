The aim of the study was to discover if soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors (sTNF-R p55 and p75) in the urine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could be used to monitor the different stages of the activity of the diseases. Twenty five patients with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were followed up during a longterm study. The 16 patients who become acutely ill with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis had significantly higher concentrations of sTNF-R p55 and p75 in their urine compared with those who were in remission, or those who were normal controls. There was a significant correlation between increased concentrations (> 20 ng/ml) of both sTNF-R p55 and p75 in the urine and a high Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and colitis activity index (CAI). Therefore, determination of sTNF-R is a good non-invasive parameter that can be used to assess the activity of disease and the efficacy of treatment.
