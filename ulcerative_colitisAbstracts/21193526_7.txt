Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by inflammation and relapsing gastrointestinal disorders. Recent studies have shown that Th17 cells, which are well known as key mediators of chronic inflammation, have a pivotal role in onset and development of IBD in humans and mice, alike. In recent years, it has been reported that IL-27, which is an IL-12-related heterodimeric cytokine consisting of EBI3 and p28 subunits, act directly on naive T cells to suppress the differentiation of Th17 cells. However, effects of exogenous IL-27 on the IBD are not well elucidated. To clarify the suppressive effect of IL-27 treatment on IBD, we applied the flexible linking method to EBI3 and p28 subunits and generated a single-chain human IL-27 (scIL-27). scIL-27 inhibited xenogenic mouse Th17 cell differentiation in vitro, indicating that scIL-27 also acts in mouse immune systems. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced mouse acute colitis model, subcutaneous scIL-27 treatment significantly improved the colon length, extent of necrosis, and ulceration and thickened epithelium and several pathological scores in a dose-dependent manner. scIL-27 clearly suppressed several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, in inflamed colon, except for anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The mesenteric lymph node cells from scIL-27-treated mice also exhibited a reduced inflammatory response and, furthermore, a lower population of Th17 cells than those of PBS-treated mice. Finally, we showed the therapeutic efficacy of scIL-27 on TNBS-induced colitis even after active colitis was established. These results suggest new possible therapeutic approaches for IBD, including disorders such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
