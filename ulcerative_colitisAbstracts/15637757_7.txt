 AIM: Recent studies suggest that Fas-mediated apoptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been hypothesized that either increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelium or decreased apoptosis of lamina propria lymphocytes may induce inflammation of gut. The aim of this study was to determine whether the Fas gene promoter polymorphism at position-670 was associated with IBD in Chinese patients. METHODS: Fifty unrelated Chinese patients with IBD (38 patients with ulcerative colitis and 12 with Crohn's disease) and 124 healthy controls were genotyped for the Fas-670 polymorphism by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The PCR product was digested by Mva I restriction enzyme. RESULTS: Distribution of the Fas-670 gene polymorphism was 33% for the AA genotype, 52% for the AG genotype and 15% for the GG genotype in 124 healthy subjects. In patients with IBD, 30% was for the AA genotype, 42% for the AG genotype and 28% for the GG genotype respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the genotype (P = 0.1498), allele frequencies (P = 0.3198) and carriage frequencies (P = 0.4133) between healthy controls and IBD patients. Furthermore, we did not find any difference between the left-sided colitis and total colitis (P = 0.8242). CONCLUSION: Fas-670 polymorphism is not associated with IBD in Chinese patients.
