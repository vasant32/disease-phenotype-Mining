AIM: To determine the plasma carnitine ester profile in adult patients with ulcerative culitis (UC) and compared with healthy control subjects. METHOD: Using ESI triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, the carnitine ester profile was measured in 44 patients with UC and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the fasting free carnitine level between the patients with UC and the healthy controls. The fasting propionyl- (0.331 +/- 0.019 vs 0.392 +/- 0.017 micromol/L), butyryl- (0.219 +/- 0.014 vs 0.265 +/- 0.012), and isovalerylcarnitine (0.111 +/- 0.008 vs 0.134 +/- 0.008) levels were decreased in the UC patients. By contrast, the level of octanoyl-(0.147 +/- 0.009 vs 0.114 +/- 0.008), decanoyl- (0.180 +/- 0.012 vs 0.137 +/- 0.008), myristoyl- (0.048 +/- 0.003 vs 0.039 +/- 0.003), palmitoyl- (0.128 +/- 0.006 vs 0.109 +/- 0.004), palmitoleyl- (0.042 +/- 0.003 vs 0.031 +/- 0.002) and oleylcarnitine (0.183 +/- 0.007 vs 0.163 +/- 0.007; P < 0.05 in all comparisons) were increased in the patients with UC. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest selective involvement of the carnitine esters in UC patients, probably due to their altered metabolism.
