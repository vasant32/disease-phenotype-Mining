INTRODUCTION: Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (Tc-99m HMPAO) labelled white cell scintigraphy (WCS) is frequently used in the assessment of patients suspected of having active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, no previous systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of this investigation in comparison with colonoscopy and histology. We therefore aim to present these data here. METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to January 2014. Prospective and retrospective cross-sectional studies recruiting adults suspected of a new diagnosis or flare of IBD, and comparing Tc-99m HMPAO labelled WCS with colonoscopy and histology, were eligible. True positive, false positive, true negative and false negative findings were pooled. A random effects model was used to obtain overall data for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: We identified 15 eligible studies reporting data from 635 patients (174 Crohn's disease, 164 ulcerative colitis, 136 non-IBD). In total 1300 bowel segments were examined with 698 true positives, 41 false positives, 461 true negatives and 100 false negatives. Sensitivity was 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95), specificity was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.94), positive predictive value was 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) and negative predictive value was 0.83 (0.76 to 0.89). CONCLUSION: Tc-99m HMPAO labelled WCS is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of active inflammatory bowel disease. Physicians may therefore find this a useful test for those in whom colonoscopy and histology are impractical or contraindicated. DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared.
