 AIM: To explore the abnormal function of platelets and the role of angelica sinensis injection (ASI) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: In 39 patients with active UC, 25 patients with remissive UC and 30 healthy people, alpha-granule membrane protein (GMP-140) and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) were detected by means of ELISA, 6-keto-PGF(1a) was detected by radioimmunoassay, platelet count (PC) and 1 min platelet aggregation rate (1 min PAR) were detected by blood automatic tester and platelet aggregation tester respectively, and von Willebrand factor related antigen (vWF:Ag) was detected by the means of monoclonal -ELISA. The 64 patients with UC were divided into two therapy groups. After routine treatment and angelica sinensis injection (ASI) + routine treatment respectively for 3 weeks, all these parameters were also detected. RESULTS: The PC, 1 min PAR and levels of GMP-140, TXB(2), and vWF:Ag in active UC were significantly higher than those in remissive UC and normal controls (P<0.05-0.01).Meanwhile, 1 min PAR and levels of GMP-140, TXB(2), and vWF:Ag in remissive UC were still significantly higher than those in normal controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, 6-keto-PGF(1a) level in active and remissive UC was remarkably lower than that in normal control (P<0.05-0.01). These parameters except 6-keto-PGF(1a) were significantly improved after the treatment in ASI therapy group (P<0.05-0.01), whereas they all were little changed in routine therapy group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Platelets can be significantly activated in UC, which might be related with vascular endothelium injury and imbalance between TXB(2) and 6-keto-PGF(1a) in blood. ASI can significantly inhibit platelet activation, relieve vascular endothelial cell injury, and improve microcirculation in UC.
