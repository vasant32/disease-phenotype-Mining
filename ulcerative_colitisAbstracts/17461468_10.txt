 AIM: To evaluate the effect of pyrrolidine dithio-carbamate (PDTC; an NF-kappaB inhibitor) administered at low (50 mg/kg) and high (100 mg/kg) doses in suppressing colitis in mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. METHODS: Mice were divided into a DSS-untreated group (normal group), DSS-treated control group, DSS+PDTC-treated group I (low-dose group), and DSS+PDTC-treated group II (high-dose group). In each group, the disease activity index score (DAI score), intestinal length, histological score, and the levels of activated NF-kappaB and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha) in tissue were measured. RESULTS: The DSS+PDTC-treated group II exhibited suppression of shortening of intestinal length and reduction of DAI score. Activated NF-kappaB level and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were significantly lower in DSS+PDTC-treated group II. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PDTC is useful for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
