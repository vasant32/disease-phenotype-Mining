<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also known as CaN19, S100A2 was identified as a potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of S100A2 is upregulated by p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proteins p63 and p73 are related to p53 and are expressed as several splice variants with partially overlapping tasks but also functions different from p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It had been shown that p63 proteins with mutations in their DNA-binding domain cause severe phenotypes in man as autosomal dominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited disease</z:e> including EEC, AEC, SHFM, LMS and ADULT syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show that S100A2 is a transcriptional target of p63/p73 family members, particularly the p63 splice variant TAp63gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regulation is mediated by a novel transcriptional element in the S100A2 promoter which is bound by TAp63gamma but not by p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutant p63 proteins derived from EEC and ADULT syndrome patients cannot activate S100A2 transcription whereas SHFM-related mutants still can stimulate the S100A2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consistent with a function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression S100A2 expression is stimulated upon DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> treatment p63gamma proteins are recruited to the S100A2 promoter in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may indicate a function of the p63-dependent S100A2 regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression </plain></SENT>
