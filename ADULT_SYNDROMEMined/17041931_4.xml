<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder which has been linked to mutation in the p63 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The p63 gene has been described in five overlapping limb malformation syndromes including the EEC syndrome (ectodermal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo> clefting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on the first case of ADULT syndrome of a mother and daughter with a new mutation R227Q in exon 6 of the p63 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This has not been previously associated with ADULT syndrome but only seen in EEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to the previously reported features of ADULT syndrome this report also describes some additional findings including hyperextensibility at the distal interphalageal joints, bilateral thumb duplication, bifid toenails, symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000076'>vesicoureteric reflux</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000412'>prominent ears</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo>, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of a patch of hair in the midline of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report expands the knowledge of genotype-phenotype data on the p63 gene and suggests there may be a considerable overlap between the EEC syndrome and the ADULT syndrome </plain></SENT>
