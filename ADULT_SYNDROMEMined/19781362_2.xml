<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> disorder known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have linked p63 gene mutation to the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic characteristics of ADULT syndrome were still not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutation analysis of p63 gene in the first Chinese ADULT syndrome family was performed using direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sequence analysis of exon 8 of p63 gene disclosed a heterozygous G&gt;A substitution at nucleotide 893 (R298Q) in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16864880 in the downstream flanking region (DFR) of p63 exon 8 was also identified in this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband and the paternal side including her father exhibited the C/G genotype at this position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C/G variant frequency in the paternal was significantly higher as compared with the maternal (6/10 vs 0/6, P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ADULT syndrome may be caused by the p63 gene mutation, and it might have closer genetic association with the paternal side in this family </plain></SENT>
