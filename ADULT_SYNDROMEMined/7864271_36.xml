<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although well-documented in clinical and epidemiological studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>) in children, the familial nature of the adult syndrome has not been well investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One approach to evaluate the familial nature of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> is through a high-risk design aimed at estimating the risk for the disorder in children of parents with child-hood-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Children at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> were ascertained from the study group of 84 referred adults with clinical diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> of the disorder, confirmed by structured interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic information on the disorder was derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> module of the Schedule for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Affective Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>Schizophrenia</z:hpo> for School Age Children--Epidemiologic Version, supplemented with information regarding treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> for the affected child and school history including repeated grades, placement in special classes, and tutoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 84 children at risk, 48 (57%) met criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of the disorder in children of adults with the disorder was significantly higher than the previously reported rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> among siblings of children with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 48 ADHD children of parents with the disorder, 36 (75%) were treated for it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of school failure were almost identical to those previously reported in a group of referred children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support the validity of the adult diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> and suggest that the adult form of this disorder may have stronger familial etiological risk factors than its pediatric form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If these results are confirmed, families selected through adult probands with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> might be especially useful for testing genetic hypotheses about the disorder </plain></SENT>
