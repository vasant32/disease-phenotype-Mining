<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four clusters of Type A items (describing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, hurried behavior, work achievement, and competitiveness) were regressed on maternal ratings of the child's <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, liveliness, anger, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo>, collected annually from infancy to adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The child's liveliness, sociability, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo> during infancy and childhood were positively related to the adult Type A <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> and hurried behavior clusters, as were the mother's liveliness, orderliness, and intelligence as rated by psychologists during the child's first 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two work-involvement clusters were predicted by interactive effects among <z:hpo ids='HP_0100962'>shyness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004396'>poor appetite</z:hpo>, and anger during adolescence but were unrelated to mother attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>Sleep disturbances</z:hpo> were only related to competitiveness and only in late adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the interrelated components of adult Type A behavior have contrasting developmental histories and that temperament-related constructs are important antecedents to the adult syndrome </plain></SENT>
