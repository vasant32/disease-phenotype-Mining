<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1977 and 1991, eighteen children (15 girls, three boys) from 13 unrelated kindreds presented with the clinical features of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> commencing between the neonatal period and 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These comprised a triad of swelling, affective disturbance and functional autonomic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a family history of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in 16 (89%) children, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 girls, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 12 (67%) children, suggesting a major genetic basis for the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations excluded cardiovascular, hypoproteinaemic, allergic and obstructive causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence to a restricted carbohydrate diet, the avoidance of refined carbohydrate and the correction of precipitating <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> controlled symptoms in most children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapses followed dietary non-compliance and life-event stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A neurotransmitter-based autonomic abnormality of vascular and visceral smooth muscle tone modulated by metabolic and neuroendocrine mechanisms provides a partial explanation for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin-mediated modulation of capillary permeability to water and electrolytes may also be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis, clinical features and management of paediatric idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> may provide a model for the adult syndrome </plain></SENT>
