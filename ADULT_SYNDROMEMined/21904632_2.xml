<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024534" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral malaria</z:e> (CM) are still incompletely understood but, clearly, cerebral complications may result from concomitant microvessel obstruction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent to which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> contributes to pathology has not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the model of P. berghei ANKA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, we compared brain microvessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of CM-susceptible and CM-resistant mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By quantitative planimetry, we provide evidence that CM is characterized by enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show a dramatic aquaporin 4 (AQP4) upregulation, selectively at the level of astrocytic foot processes, in both CM and non-CM disease, but significantly more pronounced in mice with malarial-induced neurological syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a threshold of AQP4 expression is needed to lead to neurovascular pathology, a view that is supported by significantly higher levels in mice with clinically overt CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Numbers of intravascular leukocytes significantly correlated with both PVS enlargement and AQP4 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> could be a contributing factor in CM pathogenesis and AQP4, specifically in its astrocytic location, a key molecule in this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since experimental CM is associated with substantial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, it models paediatric CM better than the adult syndrome and it is tempting to evaluate AQP4 in the former context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If AQP4 changes are confirmed in human CM, it may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
