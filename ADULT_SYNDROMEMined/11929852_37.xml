<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional co-activator p63 is of crucial importance for correct development of the limbs, ectodermal appendages (skin, nails, teeth, hair, glands), lip and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the p63 gene are found in a number of human syndromes, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate (EEC) syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), Hay-Wells syndrome and in non-syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001171'>split-hand</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001839'>split-foot</z:hpo> malformation (SHFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each syndrome has a specific pattern of mutations with different functional effects in in vitro functional assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a mutation R298Q in acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome, another EEC-like condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation is located in the DNA binding domain of p63, which harbors almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EEC associated mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, unlike mutations in EEC syndrome, the R298Q ADULT syndrome mutation does not impair DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather, the mutation confers novel transcription activation capacity on the DeltaN-p63gamma isoform, which normally does not possess such activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that ADULT syndrome is a clinically as well as molecularly distinct member of the expanding p63 mutation family of human malformation syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results further show that p63 contains a second transactivation domain which is normally repressed and can become activated by mutations in the DNA binding domain of p63 </plain></SENT>
