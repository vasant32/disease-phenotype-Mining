<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that GLUT1, GLUT4 and HKII gene expression would be reduced in heart muscle of growth-retarded rats, and that reduced gene expression would result in reduced myocardial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To prove this hypothesis, we measured cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in control IUGR rat hearts at day 21 and at day 120 of life </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that adult rats showing IUGR as a result of uteroplacental insufficiency express significantly less cardiac GLUT1 and GLUT4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein than control animals (which underwent sham operations), and that this decrease in gene expression occurs in parallel with reduced myocardial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this reduced GLUT gene expression and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake contribute towards mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> seen in adults born with IUGR </plain></SENT>
