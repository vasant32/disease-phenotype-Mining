<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various combinations of limb anomalies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasias</z:hpo> and orofacial clefts characterize heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor gene p63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causative gene is crucial during embryonic ontogenesis, mostly in the development of limbs and other ectodermal derived tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of mutations in six different p63-related syndromes (EEC syndrome, AEC syndrome, ADULT syndrome, LMS syndrome, RHS syndrome, SHFM syndrome) shows genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent p63 mutation syndrome is the EEC syndrome, characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>Ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo> often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008070'>sparse hair</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000958'>dry skin</z:hpo>, hypo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000674'>anodontia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002164'>dysplastic nails</z:hpo> and alterations in sebaceous glands, mammary glands and nipples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third hallmark of the EEC syndrome is orofacial clefting, in particular lip and palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>p63 mutations also cause the other five inherited syndromes: symptoms are overlapping, but each of these diseases has its own characteristic phenotypic features: for instance AEC syndrome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0009755'>ankyloblepharon</z:hpo>-ectodermal defects-<z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate) has as distinctive feature <z:hpo ids='HP_0009755'>ankyloblepharon</z:hpo>, while mammary glands and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002557'>nipples hypoplasia</z:hpo> are frequent findings in LMS syndrome and in ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter can be distinguished from other p63 syndromes by the absence of orofacial clefting and by prominent ectodermal signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The narrowest genotype-phenotype correlation is in the EEC and AEC syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> EEC missense mutations are clustered in the DNA binding domain and do not bind to DNA; in contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> missens mutations reported in AEC syndrome are localized in the α-motif domain, and it has been demonstrated that they disrupt interaction with other proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LMS and ADULT syndrome have their own unique mutated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33708">amino-acid residues</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33708">amino-acid residues</z:chebi> are known to be mutated amongst ADULT syndrome: asparagines 6 and arginine 298 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although R298 is in the DNA binding domain, it is functionally different from the EEC mutations, because its substitution by glutamine does not lead to a loss of DNA binding, but to a gain of transactivation activity of the ∆Np63γ isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this paper we discuss the consistent phenotypic features associated with these gain of function mutations </plain></SENT>
