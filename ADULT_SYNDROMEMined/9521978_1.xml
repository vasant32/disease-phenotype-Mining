<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and insulin levels were compared in 144 Mexican-American and Anglo-American mother-child pairs, when the children were 11 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although mean age did not differ between ethnicities, Mexican-American mothers and children both had a greater body mass index (mothers: 29.2 +/- 6.2 vs 27.2 +/- 7.9; children: 21.7 +/- 4.7 vs 19.7 +/- 4.6) and sum of skinfolds than did Anglo-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">Triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, fasting insulin, and cholesterol/<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> ratio were higher, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was lower in both Mexican-American adults and children compared with Anglo-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, only <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels remained significantly lower in Mexican-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For both adults and children, higher quartiles of insulin levels were associated with significantly higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, blood pressure and lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels (estimate of dense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> size) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A summary variable representing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> present in adult syndrome X patients was higher in both Mexican-American adults and children than in Anglo-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Mexican-American children and adults have higher levels of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and this appears related to higher insulin levels and overweight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Appropriate nutrition, weight control, and exercise at early ages could be important in slowing the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
