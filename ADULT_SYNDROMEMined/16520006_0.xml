<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since this syndrome was first described, its pathophysiology has been a matter of great debate, although it is now considered that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> could be divided into two groups: cases with unknown etiology (idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or INPH) and those which develop from several known causes (such as trauma, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of INPH is still unclear and a matter of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, the current pathophysiological conditions of INPH are analysed and the authors put forward the theory that the disease is a dynamic syndrome which occurs in patients who have suffered a significant loss of spinal compliance over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increases</z:e> more during systole in INPH patients because it cannot be compensated for by the escape of CSF into the spinal canal as effectively, due to the reduced volume or lack of distension of the spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This leads to an increase in ventricular size and causes cumulative brain damage over a long period of time and accounts for the slow, progressive nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NPH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The loss of spinal compliance with age is fundamental to the proposed theory which provides a theoretical justification for studying the spinal canal in INPH and investigating the relationship between the progressive narrowing of the spinal canal and the compensating ability of the craniospinal system </plain></SENT>
