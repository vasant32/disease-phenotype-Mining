<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic in Africa mirror those in other emerging nations: it penetrates the richer nations and urban areas first with a strong urban- rural gradient; initially it affects the wealthy, but later there is a demographic switch as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> becomes a condition more associated with poverty, and it shares many of the same drivers related to the increasing affordability of highly refined oils and carbohydrates, and a move away from subsistence farm work and towards sedentary lifestyles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Africa also has some characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> epidemic that stand out from other regions such as: (1) excepting some areas of the Pacific, Africa is probably the only region in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (especially among women) is viewed culturally as a positive and desirable trait, leading to major gender differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> rates in many countries; (2) most of Africa has very low rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in children, and to date African <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is mostly an adult syndrome; (3) Africans seem genetically prone to higher rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> than Caucasians, but seem to be relatively protected from dislipidemias; (4) the case-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and disabilities from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in Africa are very high due to the paucity of health services and the strain that the 'double burden' of disease places on health systems </plain></SENT>
