<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> syndromes have been shown to result from mutations in the gene that encodes the transcription factor p63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an 11-year-old boy, with clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parents, who had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> that resembled EEC (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-clefting) syndrome (OMIM 604292) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo> and missing middle fingers bilaterally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002164'>onychodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000668'>hypodontia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006349'>missing teeth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000966'>hypohidrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000579'>lacrimal duct obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing disclosed a heterozygous G--&gt;A substitution at nucleotide 893, that converts an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> (CGA) to glutamine (CAA), the mutation being designated R298Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mutation occurs within the DNA-binding domain of p63, and is close to many of the published EEC syndrome mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, R298Q has been described once previously in a large German pedigree, not with EEC syndrome, but another <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> disorder, ADULT (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth) syndrome (OMIM 103285) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further clinical assessment in our patient revealed that, apart from not having <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate, he had an exfoliative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo> of his hands and feet, and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001480'>freckling</z:hpo> on his face and shoulders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these features support a diagnosis of ADULT syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study has identified a specific genotype-phenotype correlation in a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo> syndrome and the findings are useful in improving genetic counselling in this family </plain></SENT>
