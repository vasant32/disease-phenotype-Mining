<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its clinical phenotype is similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate (EEC) and limb-mammary syndrome (LMS), and differs from these disorders mainly by the absence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and/or palate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a 39-year-old patient who was found to be heterozygous for a c.401G &gt; T (p.Gly134Val) de novo mutation of TP63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient had the ADULT phenotype associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings, rather than extend the clinical spectrum of ADULT syndrome, suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> can no longer be considered an element for differential diagnosis for ADULT, EEC, and LMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data, added to other reports on overlapping phenotypes, support the combining of these three phenotypes into a unique entity that we propose to call "ELA syndrome," which is an acronym of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100257'>ectrodactyly</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, limb-mammary, and ADULT syndromes </plain></SENT>
