Abdominal wall defects include a broad spectrum of structural malformations with variable severity and prognosis. The purpose of prenatal ultrasound examination is to correctly diagnose and classify these malformations according to their localization (particularly their relation to the umbilical cord insertion), their contents, their size and associated malformations or karyotypic abnormalities. Based on this examination, two groups can be distinguished: gastroschisis or omphalocele (when the latter is isolated, in particular without karyotypic abnormalities) which can be surgically corrected at birth, and for which predictive criteria of outcome must be evaluated (vitality of herniated bowel, size and contents of omphalocele); severe malformations (ectopia cordis, cloacal exstrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, short umbilical cord, amniotic band syndrome) for which pregnancy termination could be proposed.
