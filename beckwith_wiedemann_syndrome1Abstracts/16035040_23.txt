Epigenetic modification of the cytosine base of DNA by its methylation introduced the possibility that beyond the inherent information contained within the nucleotide sequence there was an additional layer of information added to the underlying genetic code. DNA methylation has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions, including an essential developmental role in the reprogramming of germ cells and early embryos, the repression of endogenous retrotransposons, and a generalized role in gene expression. Special functions of DNA methylation include the marking of one of the parental alleles of many imprinted genes, a group of genes essential for growth and development in mammals with a unique parent-of-origin expression pattern, a role in stabilizing X-chromosome inactivation, and centromere function. In this regard, it is not surprising that errors in establishing or maintaining patterns of methylation are associated with a diverse group of human diseases and syndromes.
