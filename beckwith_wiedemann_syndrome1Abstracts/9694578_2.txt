Silent and incidentally detected adrenocortical neoplasms are the most frequent abnormality of the adrenal cortex. The prevalence of these lesions in the general population is around 1%, increases with age and reaches 6% in the seventh decade of life. Primary adrenocortical carcinoma, on the other hand, a highly malignant tumor, is rare with an incidence of 1.7 cases per million per year. Recent progress has been achieved in the understanding of adrenocortical tumorigenesis by mapping and identification of genes responsible for hereditary tumor syndromes like the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Carney complex and the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I. Investigation of the clonal composition of adrenal tumors demonstrates that adrenal carcinomas are generally monoclonal, whereas adrenal adenoma may be polyclonal in approximately 25% of cases. These adenomas may have a multicellular origin under the putative action of extra-adrenal and local growth factors. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in adrenal carcinomas include mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and rearrangements of the chromosomal locus 11 p15.5 associated with IGF II hyperexpression. Constitutive activation of the ACTH receptor-G protein-cAMP signal cascade does not play a role in adrenal tumor formation. Conversely, deletions of the ACTH receptor gene have been recently found in undifferentiated adenomas and in aggressive adrenocortical carcinomas. This indicates that the signaling pathways responsible for adrenocortical tumor formation are different from that of other endocrine neoplasms like pituitary and thyroid adenomas.
