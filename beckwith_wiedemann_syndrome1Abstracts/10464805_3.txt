Primary neoplasms of the adrenal cortex are rare in children and differ significantly in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and biologic features from their counterparts in adults. In children, the inclusive term adrenocortical neoplasm is applied because adrenal adenoma and adrenal carcinoma may be difficult to distinguish histopathologically. Pediatric adrenocortical neoplasms typically occur before 5 years of age, affect young girls more commonly than boys, and are associated with hemihypertrophy and Beckwith-Wiedemann and Li-Fraumeni syndromes. Most children with an adrenocortical neoplasm present with signs and symptoms of endocrine abnormality, including virilization and Cushing syndrome. Cross-sectional imaging studies typically demonstrate a large, circumscribed, predominantly solid suprarenal mass with variable heterogeneity due to hemorrhage and necrosis. Calcification is not uncommon. Local invasion and metastases to the lungs, liver, and regional lymph nodes may be present at diagnosis. When friable tumor thrombus extends into the inferior vena cava, it poses a high risk of pulmonary embolization. The finding of increased retroperitoneal fat due to hypercortisolism on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images of children with an adrenal mass favors the diagnosis of adrenocortical neoplasm. Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy, with chemotherapy used for patients with metastases or persistent elevated hormone levels following surgery. Patients younger than 5 years with aggressive adrenocortical neoplasms fare better than older children.
