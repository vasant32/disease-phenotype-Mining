Hepatoblastoma is the most common liver malignancy in childhood. The reported incidence is 11.2 cases per 1 million during the first year of life. Genetic predispositions include Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and familial polyposis. The prognosis depends on the extent of tumor spreading at the time of initial treatment, which typically includes chemotherapy and surgery. Imaging of hepatoblastoma has only rarely been reported prenatally. Here we report a recent case with a successful outcome and discuss issues of differential diagnosis and treatment.
