Intrauterine growth restriction is known to be associated with many medical problems for the baby, both before and after delivery. The mechanisms involved in fetal growth are not well understood, with an increasing range of metabolic diseases being implicated. Several key genes involved in normal embryonic and fetal growth and development are now known to be imprinted. Disruption of this parent-specific mono-allelic expression causes phenotypic changes, many of which are important for growth and development. Two growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, are discussed in detail as they represent well-characterized phenotypes that arise as a consequence of disrupted imprinting. These human models will allow us to elucidate key genes and mechanisms important in normal fetal growth.
