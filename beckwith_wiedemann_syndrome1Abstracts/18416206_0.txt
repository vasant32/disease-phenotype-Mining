We report the anesthetic management of an infant with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome having massive macroglossia and umbilical hernia. Umbilical hernia repair and tongue reductions were performed under general anesthesia. Although a difficult airway was anticipated, we did not have difficulty in her airway management, even with tracheal intubation. After the operation, mechanical ventilation was required for three days because of airway obstruction by secretions in the mouth and her edematous tongue. She had no complications and the postoperative course was uneventful.
