We present a three generation family in which a father and son have a balanced chromosome translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 5 and 11 (karyotype 46,XY,t(5;11)(p15.3;p15.3)). Two family members have inherited the unbalanced products of this translocation and are trisomic for chromosome 11p15.3-->pter and monosomic for chromosome 5p15.3-->pter (karyotype 46,XY,der(5)t(5;11)(p15.3;p15.3)pat). Paternally derived duplications of 11p15.5 are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and both family members trisomic for 11p15.5 had prenatal overgrowth (birth weights >97th centile), macroglossia, coarse facial features, and broad hands. We review the clinical features of BWS patients who have a paternally derived duplication of 11p15.5 and provide evidence for a distinct pattern of dysmorphic features in those with this chromosome duplication. Interestingly, our family is the fifth unrelated family to be reported with a balanced reciprocal translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 5 and 11. The apparently non-random nature of this particular chromosome translocation is suggestive of sequence homology between the two chromosome regions involved in the translocation.
