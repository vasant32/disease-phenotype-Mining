Whereas the omphalocele develops from a malformation of the mesoderm during the embryonal period, the gastroschisis appears to be the result of an intrauterine vascular occlusion; defined as disruption. Definite signs of malformations are seen in omphalocele. In our patient population observed during a three year period, eight cases of abdominal wall defects were seen, four of which with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome and one with trisomy 18, two with an isolated omphalocele and one with a gastroschisis. The concomitance of genetic malformation syndromes implies the necessity of intrauterine diagnosis evaluation. In proven cases of chromosomopathies and signs of omphalocele in ultrasound an interruption of pregnancy may be indicated. Similarly with very unfavourable prognosis such as Edwards syndrome, a post partum operative intervention is not necessary. This decision however can only be reached through interdisciplinary consultation between the pediatrician, pediatric surgeon, midwife and parents.
