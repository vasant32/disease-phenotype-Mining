During 1984-1989, 116 cases of omphalocele and 42 cases of gastroschisis were detected among 736,760 consecutive births in the area covered by five Italian congenital malformation registries. The prevalence rate was 1.6 per 10,000 for omphalocele and 0.6 per 10,000 for gastroschisis. Three additional cases were detected among spontaneous abortions, giving a total of 117 cases of omphalocele and 44 of gastroschisis. No variations in prevalence rates were observed among registries. A cluster of omphalocele was found in 1989 in Firenze. All cases were sporadic except for one infant with two sibs with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. A predominance of male infants was observed for both defects. This study confirms the very young maternal age for isolated gastroschisis as compared to that for omphalocele and controls. Birth weight and the percentage of small-for-date is different among isolated gastroschisis, omphalocele and controls. Associated anomalies occurred in 45 cases of omphalocele and 11 cases of gastroschisis. Our data confirm the association of omphalocele with trisomies 13 and 18. Twelve cases of omphalocele and gastroschisis with associated limb defects were classified as limb body wall complex. The possible differences in etiopathology between omphalocele and gastroschisis, both isolated and associated, are discussed.
