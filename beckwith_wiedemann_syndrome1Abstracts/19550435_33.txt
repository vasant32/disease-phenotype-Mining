Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a model disorder for the study of imprinting, growth dysregulation, and tumorigenesis. Unique observations in this disorder point to an important embryonic developmental window relevant to the observations of increased monozygotic twinning and an increased rate of epigenetic errors after subfertility/assisted reproduction.
