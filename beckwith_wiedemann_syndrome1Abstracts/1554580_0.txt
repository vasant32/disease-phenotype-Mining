This paper reviews the contribution of sonography in assessing common and some less common neonatal and pediatric disorders. The samples reflect the strength or currently perceived weaknesses of sonography and duplex Doppler studies in both neonates and children. Controversies, when present, are highlighted to provoke thought and remind us that many of the premises on which we base our research are, themselves, still shaky. Comments are provided to encourage complementary studies by other investigators or by the original authors. Because of their significance for the practice of pediatric radiology and sonography, two studies, one adult and one experimental, are incorporated. Since there is still plenty of room for improving sonographic techniques and technology and because new developments, such as the use of contrast agents, are in the horizon, the true limitations of sonography and duplex and color Doppler is yet unknown. Therefore, because of the well-known advantages of using sonography in children, we must exhaust all our efforts, "tricks," and resources as a sonographer before we subject the child to more invasive, stressful, and expensive studies. Meanwhile, knowledge of the strength of other modalities should help us avoid undue bias and single-mindedness.
