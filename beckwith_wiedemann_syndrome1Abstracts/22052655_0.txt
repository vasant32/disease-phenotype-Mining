We evaluated a patient with mild intellectual disability, obesity, overgrowth, and dysmorphic features. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis showed a single copy number increase of a BAC clone in the 11p15.4 region. Oligonucleotide aCGH refined the duplication to approximately 2.29 megabases (Mb) in size. Testing the parents revealed that the father, who had learning disabilities and overgrowth, also had the 11p15.4 duplication, and the mother had a normal microarray. In addition, the patient's brother and grandmother all share clinical features with the proband and tested positive for the duplication. The duplicated region (Chr11:6,934,067-9,220,605) encompasses 29 genes, including the ZNF214 gene, which has been postulated to play a role in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [Alders et al., 2000]. This three-generation pedigree outlines features of a novel microduplication syndrome. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
