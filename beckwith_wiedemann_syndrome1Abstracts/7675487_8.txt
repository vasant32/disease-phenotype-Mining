Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital disorder manifested by organomegaly, omphalocele, hypoglycemia, and macroglossia. We have found a significant number of these children to be at risk for upper airway obstruction during infancy or childhood. In this review of 13 children, 2 required tracheotomy during infancy for cor pulmonale caused by macroglossia. Seven of nine children older than 1 year required tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy to relieve upper airway obstruction. Although macroglossia can be a cause of airway obstruction in infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, we have found that airway obstruction during childhood is related to tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy and not to macroglossia. Anterior tongue reduction is reserved for the correction of malocclusion, articulation errors, or cosmesis, whereas tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy may be curative of obstructive symptoms.
