Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a rare congenital overgrowth syndrome. It carries important connotations for the pediatric urologist because it is associated with an increased risk for developing certain embryonal tumors. Until recently, these patients were not diagnosed until after birth; however, with newer imaging modalities, this syndrome may be diagnosed prenatally. We present a case of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, depicting the prenatal modalities that may be used to diagnose this unusual condition.
