Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with craniofacial abnormalities that may predispose patients to sleep-related breathing disorders. There is limited literature on the polysomnography findings for children with this syndrome. Three patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome underwent polysomnography in our sleep lab and were found to have a variety of sleep-disordered breathing that ranged from obstructive apnea to isolated REM sleep-related hypoxemia-hypoventilation without obstructive apnea. Suspicion for sleep-disordered breathing should be high in children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
