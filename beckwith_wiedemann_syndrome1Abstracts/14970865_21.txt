Constitutional chromosome deletions and duplications frequently predispose to the development of a wide variety of cancers. We have developed a microarray of 6000 bacterial artificial chromosomes for array-based comparative genomic hybridisation, which provides an average resolution of 750 kb across the human genome. Using these arrays, subtle gains and losses of chromosome regions can be detected in constitutional cells, following a single overnight hybridisation. In this report, we demonstrate the efficiency of this procedure in identifying constitutional deletions and duplications associated with predisposition to retinoblastoma, Wilms tumour and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
