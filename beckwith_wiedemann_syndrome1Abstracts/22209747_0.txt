Our knowledge about inherited susceptibility to adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) almost exclusively stems from experiences with familial cancer susceptibility syndromes, which are caused by single gene mutations (e.g. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Population-based studies are largely unavailable. ACC diagnosed during childhood is known to be commonly part of hereditary cancer syndromes. Childhood ACC is part of the classical tumor spectrum of LFS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). In adults ACC has been reported in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1), familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). However, the evidence associating ACC with these syndromes is less well substantiated. Here, we will review the evidence for genetic predisposition in general and the association with known familial cancer susceptibility syndromes in particular. We will also review current recommendations regarding screening and surveillance of these patients as they apply to a specialized ACC or endocrine cancer clinic.
