A high incidence of congenital malformations with Wilms' tumor had been recognized lately. Aniridia, hemihypertrophy, chromosome deletion, urinary tract anomalies, and Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome have often been observed in patients with Wilms' tumor. However, Wilms' tumor associated with Moyamoya disease, which refers to a stenosis of the distal portion of the carotid artery with an abnormal network in the brain base, has never been reported. In this report, a male child aged 28 mo. with Wilms' tumor associated with Moyamoya disease is presented.
