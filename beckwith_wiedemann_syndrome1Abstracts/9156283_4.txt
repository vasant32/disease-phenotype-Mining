The two main renal tumours, Wilms' tumour and renal cell carcinoma, are associated with distinct molecular genetic abnormalities. The genes involved behave as Knudson oncosuppressor genes. Further dissection of the molecular biology pathways involving WT1 and VHL genes is providing fascinating insight into the biology of these genes, the development and cell biology of the kidney and its tumours.
