Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is the most common overgrowth malformation syndrome. The classical features include macrosomia, macroglossia, omphalocele and ear lobe anomalies. Among the associated adrenal anomalies, foetal cortical cytomegaly, outer cortical haemorrhage and unilateral benign cysts are well described. A term neonate was admitted with typical features of the syndrome. Radiological evaluation revealed a rare association of bilateral benign hamorrhagic adrenal cysts. Serial sonography confirmed hamorrhage into benign cysts and ruled out neoplasms. Only one similar case has been documented in the literature previously.
