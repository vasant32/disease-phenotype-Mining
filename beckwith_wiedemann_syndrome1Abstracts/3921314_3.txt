The neonate appears to be in a transitional stage of glucose homeostasis. Maturation of neonatal glucose homeostasis requires coordination of opposing hormonal, neural, and enzymatic controls. The vulnerability of the neonate to carbohydrate disequilibrium has been described by tracing the maturation of carbohydrate homeostasis physiologically. The many examples of neonatal hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been enumerated. Much information in recent years has increased our understanding of the mechanism of these conditions in the newborn. Continued research of the biochemical and physiologic bases for alterations of carbohydrate metabolism should further enhance our ability to diagnose and treat the neonate effectively.
