Wilms' tumor has served as a model of multiple genetic alterations in childhood cancer. This review summarizes work in our laboratory identifying several of these alterations. These include the localization to 11p15 of an embryonal tumor suppressor gene and at least one gene for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which predisposes to Wilms' tumor; as well as a novel mutational mechanism in man, loss of imprinting.
