Patients with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS, MIM 130650), a congenital overgrowth syndrome, have a known increased tumor risk especially for embryonic tumors. WBS belongs to the "imprinting" syndromes caused by overexpression of IGF2 and/or loss of CDKN1C on chromosome 11p15.5. A 13-year-old boy with WBS developed a spitzoid malignant melanoma (Clark level V, Breslow index 4.8â€‰mm) on the right cheek. Genetic analyses of the patient's blood showed hypermethylation at the H19 locus on chromosome 11p. The (epi)genetic changes of the WBS locus might have played a role in the pathogenesis of melanoma development.
