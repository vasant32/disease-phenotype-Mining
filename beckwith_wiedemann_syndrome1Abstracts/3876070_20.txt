An association between trisomy 11p15 and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is described in two brothers. The first presented at birth with gigantism and macroglossia, umbilical hernia and abdominal distention, hypoglycemia and atresia of the pulmonary artery, leading to the diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Facial dysmorphism also included: a hypoplastic midface, hypertelorism, and a short nose with a flattened bridge. The karyotype showed a trisomy 11p15 with a monosomy 18p11, due to a t(11;18)(p154;p111)pat. His brother, born a year later, showed the same signs. The association between trisomy 11p15 and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is in certain cases well established.
