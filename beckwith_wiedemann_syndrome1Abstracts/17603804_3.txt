Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of childhood tumors. Here we describe a patient with BWS who developed a central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). To our knowledge, despite the known cancer predisposition, this patient is the first described with BWS to develop an AT/RT. Due to the high propensity of these patients to develop childhood tumors, in addition to routine diagnostic tests, analysis of the tumor DNA using the Illumina Infinium whole-genome genotyping 550K Beadchip was performed to investigate a possible common underlying mechanism for his BWS and AT/RT. The only alteration detected was monosomy 22, which was accompanied by a somatic mutation in the INI1 rhabdoid tumor gene. These results suggest that, despite an underlying cancer predisposition, the occurrence of BWS and AT/RT in this patient may be unrelated.
