A novel gene, C11orf2, was identified by BLAST search in the human chromosome 11p15.5 region potentially responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and some cancers. Two cDNA clones with different sizes were obtained, which share a potential ORF of 399bp and are different in their 3' untranslated regions. This gene was revealed to be expressed exclusively in human heart and in almost no other tissues examined by northern blotting. Two transcripts of different sizes, 0.9 and 3.1kb, were identified in heart, consistent with the length of the two cDNA clones. The gene shows biallelic expression (non-imprinted) in fetal liver, although it is located in the imprinted domain of 11p15.5. C11orf21 codes a protein of 132 amino acids as proved by the expression of C11orf21-EGFP fusion protein in cultured cells. The EGFP-fusion protein expressed in cultured cells localized mainly in the cytoplasm.
