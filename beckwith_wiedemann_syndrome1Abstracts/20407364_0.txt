Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a complex overgrowth disorder usually recognized at birth. Children diagnosed with BWS, particularly those with hemi-hypertrophy, experience an increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors. This case report presents a 12-year-old girl with BWS and hemi-hypertrophy who rapidly developed enlarging, asymmetric tumors of bilateral breasts. Few cases of patients with BWS and benign breast tumors exist in the literature. The differential diagnosis of breast tumors in the adolescent female is described. The treatment plan and reconstruction options particular to the developing young female are also discussed.
