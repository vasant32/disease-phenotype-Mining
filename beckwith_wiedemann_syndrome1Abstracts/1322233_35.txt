We describe the way in which application of cytogenetic and molecular genetic techniques to the study of Wilms' tumor (WT) of the kidney and the associated congenital disorders, such as sporadic aniridia and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, has led to identification of two regions on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13 and 11p15) involved in tumor development. In addition, evidence shows that genomic imprinting may be an important factor in transformation. Such investigations have led to cloning of a candidate WT gene (WT1) from 11p13. Linkage studies in familial studies suggest that an additional locus is involved. Analysis of the cytogenetic data available on this tumor suggests that this may be situated on 1p, 16q, or 17p.
