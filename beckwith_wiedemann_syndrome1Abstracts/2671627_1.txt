The paper describes a case of Sotos syndrome and reviews the world literature on the subject. Inheritance may be dominant autosomal as well as recessive, although the latter is quite rare. The pathophysiology is not well known but a common underlying basis between various syndromes (Sotos; Beckwith-Wiedemann; Klippel-Trenaunay) is hypothesised.
