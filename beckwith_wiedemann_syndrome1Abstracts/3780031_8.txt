Four cases of duplication of a segment of 11p have been reported in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (Waziri et al. 1983, Turleau et al. 1984). We describe a patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who has a deletion of chromosome 11(p11p13) and suggest involvement of this chromosomal region in both the duplicated and deleted states such as occurs in Prader-Willi syndrome.
