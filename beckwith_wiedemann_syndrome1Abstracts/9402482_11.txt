Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is an important tumor marker for yolk sac tumor and hepatoblastoma in childhood. We have been using the graph of the normal range of serum AFP made by Tsuchida et al, when we evaluate the serum AFP levels in early infancy. We measured the serum AFP levels by an immunoradiometric assay in 163 normal infants under 2 years of age, in order to make a more precise graph. Our normal range was a little wider than that of Tsuchida et al. According to our graph, false-positive cases would be fewer. Referring to the half-lives of serum AFP levels in normal infancy is also useful, when it is difficult to evaluate the AFP level.
