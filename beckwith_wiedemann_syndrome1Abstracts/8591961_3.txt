The study of Wilms tumor-predisposing congenital syndromes has led to the identification of one tumor-suppressor gene, WT1, and to the localization of WT2. Molecular genetic analyses of these and sporadic Wilms tumors have clarified the role of WT1 in Wilms tumor with aniridia, genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation (WAGR)-syndrome patients, but much remains unclear in the case of WT2 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Loci on chromosomes 16q and 1p have now been implicated in the progression of Wilms tumor and may serve as molecular prognostic markers. It is now clear that Wilms tumors are genetically heterogeneous and may be multigenic in origin. Molecular analyses can now be used for genetic counseling in some children and may become useful in individualizing therapy.
