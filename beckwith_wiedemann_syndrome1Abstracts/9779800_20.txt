Genomic imprinting of chromosome arm 11p is involved in the Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS). About 20% of patients with sporadic WBS have paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of 11p. Mitotic recombination at the 11p region has been suggested to be responsible for the somatic mosaicism in these patients. Our current study concerning sporadic WBS patients demonstrated six patients with mosaic isodisomy restricted to part of 11p and one patient with mosaic paternal uniparental disomy for the whole chromosome 11. Apparently the clinical findings for this patient did not differ from data reported for other WBS patients. This case makes it unlikely that the proximal short arm and the long arm of chromosome 11 contain imprinted genes with a phenotype recognizable prenatally or in infancy, and gives some support to the hypothesis that non-mosaic UPD-11 is prenatally lethal.
