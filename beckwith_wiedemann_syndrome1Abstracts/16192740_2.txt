Tall stature is less often experienced as an important problem than short stature. However, a correct diagnosis may be of eminent importance, especially when interventions are planned, or to know the natural history. Overgrowth can be caused by endocrine disorders and skeletal dysplasias, but also by several genetic syndromes. Despite a systematic diagnostic approach, there will be patients with tall stature who do not fit a known diagnosis. In this group of patients possibilities of genetic analysis do exist, but are not common practice. The FMR1 gene should be analyzed in patients with tall stature and mental retardation, and in these patients the NSD1 gene can be considered whenever some features of Sotos syndrome do exist. In tall patients without mental retardation and some features of Sotos or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome it may still be useful to look for mutations in the NSD1 gene, but also for changes in the 11p15 region. The various possibilities are discussed and placed in a flowchart.
