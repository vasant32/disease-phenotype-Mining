Macroglossia is defined as a resting tongue that protrudes beyond the teeth or alveolar ridge. Complications of macroglossia include articulation errors, mandibular deformities, deglutition difficulties, and airway obstruction. Etiologies include hypothyroidism, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, lymphangiomatosis, and amyloidosis. Surgical correction of this condition at an early age may prevent or minimize the maxillofacial deformities and speech defects.
