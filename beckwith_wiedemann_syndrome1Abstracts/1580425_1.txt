In this paper we report a review of the omphalic pathology that was admitted to our hospital from january 1973 through december 1990. Eleven cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome were diagnosed during this period of time. Our eleven cases comply with at least three of the four major criteria (omphalocele, macroglossia, gigantism and neonatal hypoglycemia) and several of the minor criteria. The interest of this paper is based on the rareness of this syndrome and its association in two of our cases with Cacchi-Ricci Syndrome. Moreover, one of these cases later presented with a Wilms' tumor. Finally, we emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis of this syndrome in order to avoid the metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia), to establish prompt treatment of the serious anomalies (omphalocele) and to control and follow these patients since they have increased risk to develop neoplastic disease.
