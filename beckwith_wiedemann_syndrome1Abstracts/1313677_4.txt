The association between Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hepatoblastoma is well established and relatively commonplace. The occurrence of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome in individuals with occult neoplasia is also well documented. However, the development of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome in an infant with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hepatoblastoma has not been reported previously. The list of underlying causes of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome should be expanded to include hepatoblastoma, particularly in any child with features suggestive of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
