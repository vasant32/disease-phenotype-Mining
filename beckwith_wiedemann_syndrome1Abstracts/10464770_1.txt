Genes are recognized as undergoing genomic imprinting when they are capable of being expressed only from the paternal or only from the maternal chromosome. The process can occur coordinately within large physical domains in mammalian chromosomes. One interesting facet of the study of genomic imprinting is that it offers insight into the regulation of large chromosomal regions. Understanding this regulation involves elucidating the cis-acting regulators of gene expression and defining the elements that maintain chromatin insulation, both required for understanding more practically applicable areas of biological research, such as efficient transgene production. This review is focused on the regulation of the imprinted domain of human chromosome 11p15.5, responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Recent findings indicate that the maintenance of imprinting within this domain is critically dependent on the stable maintenance of chromatin insulation.
