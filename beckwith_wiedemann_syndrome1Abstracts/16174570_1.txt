OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of ultrasound in diagnosis of congenital renal malformations. METHODS: The records of obstetric ultrasound examinations were reviewed in all the pregnant women admitted in Alta Bates Perinatal Diagnostic center (Oakland, California, USA) during 5 years. RESULTS: Ultrasound examination identified 58 cases of congenital renal malformations of different kinds, including 4 cases of renal agenesis, 8 multicystic dysplastic kidney, 5 cystic renal dysplasia with obstructions, 6 renal and ureteral duplications, 6 ectopic kidneys, 18 hydronephroses, 3 autosomal recessive polycystic kidney diseases, 2 autosomal dominant polycystic diseases, 1 Finnish-type congenital nephrosis, 3 Meckel-Gruber syndromes, and 2 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes. Different renal malformations had different ultrasound findings that correlated to abnormalities in embryonic developments. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract abnormalities have a profound effect on pregnancy outcome, especially when associated with oligohydramnios. Many urinary anomalies can be readily detected and diagnosed by ultrasound, which provides a useful modality in diagnosis of fetal congenital renal malformations. Clear understanding of the causes of these abnormalities facilitates prognostic evaluation and clinical decision on the treatment protocol.
