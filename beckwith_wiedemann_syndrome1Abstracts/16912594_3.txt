The presence of enlarged, echogenic kidneys in a newborn with generalized macrosomia points toward diagnosis of an overgrowth syndrome. These include Beckwith-Wiedemann, Perlman and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndromes. Perlman syndrome is an autosomal recessively inherited overgrowth syndrome characterized by fetal gigantism, visceromegaly, unusual face, bilateral renal hamartomas with nephroblastomatosis, and Wilms tumor. We report a male infant who exhibits typical features of Perlman syndrome with an unusual presentation. In this report, it is emphasized that hemangioma in neonatal period may be an unusual finding in Perlman syndrome.
