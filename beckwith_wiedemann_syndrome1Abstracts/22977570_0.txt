Assisted reproductive technology (ART) including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have been shown to be associated with abnormal genomic imprinting, thus increasing the incidence of imprinting disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) in ART-conceived children. Furthermore, a recent study described abnormal DNA methylation in clinically normal children conceived by ART. However, data from different studies are conflicting or inconclusive. This study examined DNA methylation patterns of multiple imprinted genes in children born after ART to primarily evaluate the impact of ART on genomic imprinting. A total of 101 newborns conceived by ART (40 ICSI and 61 IVF) and 60 naturally conceived newborns were involved in our study. After obtaining the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee, umbilical cord blood was collected from each infant. Genomic DNA was isolated from each blood sample and treated using sodium bisulfite. Subsequently, using methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), we analyzed six differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including KvDMR1, SNRPN, MEST, MEG3, TNDM and XIST. Meanwhile, information regarding twin pregnancies, gestational age, and birth weight of the neonates was documented. None of the cases presented with phenotypic abnormalities. Children conceived by ART were more likely to have low birth weight and to be born before term, compared with children conceived spontaneously. However, 7 months to 3 years of clinical follow-up showed that none of the children had clinical symptoms of any imprinting diseases. Furthermore, the MS-PCR results showed that all 161 children had normal DNA methylation patterns at six DMRs despite the different mode of conception. Our data did not indicate a higher risk of DNA-methylation defects in children born after ART. However, further studies using quantitative methods are needed to confirm these results.
