The increasing occurrence of incidentally discovered benign adrenocortical tumors has become a clinical dilemma because of the difficulties in differentiating them from their malignant counterpart. Adrenocortical tumors are associated with familial cancer syndromes such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the Carney complex, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and the McCune-Albright syndrome. Genetic events are known to take place on the chromosomal and gene level in sporadic adrenocortical tumors.
