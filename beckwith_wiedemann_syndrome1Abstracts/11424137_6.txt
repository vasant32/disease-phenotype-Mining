A girl born with a left chest wall hamartoma, macroglossia, nevus flammeus of the middle forehead, and a small umbilical hernia developed left lower extremity hemihypertrophy by 1 year of age and is assumed to have Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. Hamartoma of the bladder and a cardiac fibrous hamartoma have been reported previously in association with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome. Infantile hamartomas are exceedingly rare and add to the spectrum of tumor formation in the syndrome.
