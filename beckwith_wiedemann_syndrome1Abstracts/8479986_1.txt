Unhappy with our postoperative results from standard tongue reduction methods, we have developed a central tongue reduction technique. This technique allows for alteration of the tongue base as well as tongue height and width while minimizing postoperative scarring. Although the technique and its associated surgical complications are in some ways comparable with the standard tongue reduction methods, our postoperative polysomnographic and tongue functioning results are improved. It is noteworthy that none of our patients had worse speech postoperatively and that our one Down syndrome patient had improved speech. Our indication for central tongue reduction is macroglossia of any sort in appropriate patients.
