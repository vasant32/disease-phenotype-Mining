Two cases of children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are presented. This syndrome consists of various abnormalities, including macroglossia, visceromegaly, omphalocele, and gigantism. These abnormalities frequently require operative correction during the neonatal period. We anesthesiologists should make plans for difficult airway managements in patients with this syndrome. Our two patients also showed larger sized tracheas than those estimated by their age and height. A cuffed tube, though still controversial, has recently been used in children. We recommend using a cuffed tube in patients with this syndrome, because the appropriate tracheal size may not be predictable, tracheal intubation might be difficult, and risks incurred during changing of a tracheal tube should be avoided.
