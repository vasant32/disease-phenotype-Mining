Genetic counselling deals with illness. Often, an "objective" theory of illness is presented, which is put into a subjective theory by the client. As an example, interviews with parents of children who have a Wiedemann-Beckwith-Syndrome are analysed. It can be shown that generating a subjective theory of illness is strongly connected with the experiencing of the illness. Thus, parents assess the Syndrome of their child quite differently and construct specific subjective theories about it. Especially assumptions about the cause of the illness differ.
