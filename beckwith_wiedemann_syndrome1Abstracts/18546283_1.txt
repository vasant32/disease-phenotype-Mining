Literature review and clinical findings in four affected adult males from one family suggest that there are serious and currently ill-defined health risks in adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). These may include male subfertility, vascular anomalies, renal abnormalities, hearing loss and, possibly, an increased risk for adult-onset malignancy. Given present knowledge, recommendations in caring for adults with this disorder remain tentative but likely should include counseling for possible infertility in males, screening echocardiography, renal sonogram and renal function testing, and counseling about possible increased risk for adult onset malignancy.
