Genomic imprinting leads to parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression of about 60 known genes in the mammalian genome. It was discovered 20 years ago and the aim of this review is to summarize its main characteristics. The nature of the imprint, still unknown, is characterized by differential chromatin structure and DNA methylation. The imprint is reset at each generation during gametogenesis, which can be observed by demethylation in the PGCs, then gamete-specific remethylation. The imprinted genes are usually located in clusters and regulated by cis sequences such as imprinting centres, trans factors such as the insulator protein CTCF and/or large non coding antisense RNAs. Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of the imprinted clusters can lead to human diseases such as Prader-Willi, Angelman or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes.
