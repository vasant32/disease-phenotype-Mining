We report the first use of the ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit (RRM1) locus as a marker to assist in defining genetic rearrangements at 11p15. Our sample consisted of 21 Wilms' tumors from 18 patients, and one adrenal adenoma from a patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, preexisting chromosome 11 maps being refined by the use of the RRM1 locus in all cases. Significantly, one Wilms' tumor showed loss of heterozygosity at the RRM1 locus only, whereas the adrenal adenoma showed a maintenance of heterozygosity at the RRM1 locus, loss having been previously demonstrated at the c-Ha-ras locus. The relevance of this finding to the location of one or more disease-associated loci at 11p15 is discussed.
