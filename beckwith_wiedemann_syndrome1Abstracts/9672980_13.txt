The fetal kidney is formed by the development of nephrons from fetal metanephric blastema surrounding the ureteric bud. The fetal renal tissue matures into normal renal parenchyma during gestation, but, occasionally, fetal tissue persists into infancy as microscopic foci called nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests are found in approximately 1% of infant kidneys at autopsy. Nephrogenic rests are associated with an increased risk of Wilms tumor, and it is theorized that nephrogenic rests undergo neoplastic change into Wilms tumor. Fortunately, this transformation occurs in less than 1% of young children with nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests are associated with many syndromes, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemihypertrophy, and sporadic aniridia. Children with identifiable syndromes, once diagnosed, should be screened for the development of Wilms tumor. Nephrogenic rests are associated with other lesions such as multilocular cystic nephroma and multicystic dysplasia, usually without malignant complications.
