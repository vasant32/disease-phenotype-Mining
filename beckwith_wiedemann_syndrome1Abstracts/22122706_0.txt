Human imprinting disorders can provide critical insights into the role of imprinted genes in human development and health, and the molecular mechanisms that regulate genomic imprinting. To illustrate these concepts we review the clinical and molecular features of several human imprinting syndromes including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, pseudohypoparathyroidism, transient neonatal diabetes, familial complete hydatidiform moles and chromosome 14q32 imprinting domain disorders.
