A specific subset of solid childhood tumors-Wilms' tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma-is characterized by its association with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Genetic abnormalities found in these tumors affect the same chromosome region (11p15), which has been implicated in the etiology of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This suggests that the development of these tumors occurs along a common genetic pathway involving chromosome 11. To search for additional common genetic pathways, this article reviews the genetic data published for these tumors. It was found that, up until now, the only genetic abnormalities detected in all four tumors affect chromosome band 11p15 and the TP53 gene. In addition, there are several aberrations that occur in two or three of the neoplasms. It is concluded that, of the four tumors, the genetic relationship is most evident between Wilms' tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma.
