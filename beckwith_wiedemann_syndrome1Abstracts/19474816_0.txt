This report describes for the first time the association of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and hypothyroidism in a 25 weeks preterm neonate. Antenatal diagnosis of exomphalos in association with postnatal transient hypoglycemia and macroglossia formed the basis of the diagnosis of BWS. Primary hypothyroidism was detected on routine Guthrie card examination. Molecular DNA analysis demonstrated biparental inheritance of chromosome 11p15.5. Dosage analysis of differently methylated region showed evidence of loss of maternal methylation at KvDMR1.
