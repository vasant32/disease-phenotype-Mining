Cochlear implantation in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media is managed with perioperative antibiotics; however, fungal overgrowth can occur. We present a child who received oral cefdinir and topical ofloxacin (Floxin). After 6 weeks, a fungal (Candida) biofilm was demonstrated on the implant surface. In this clinical setting, an antimicrobial strategy using an oral antifungal to prevent fungal overgrowth is a possibility.
