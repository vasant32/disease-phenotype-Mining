The parent-of-origin-dependent expression of IGF2 and H19 is controlled by the imprinting center 1 (IC1) consisting of a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator. IC1 is normally methylated on the paternal chromosome and nonmethylated on the maternal chromosome. We found that 22 cases in a large cohort of patients affected by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) had IC1 methylated on both parental chromosomes, resulting in biallelic activation of IGF2 and biallelic silencing of H19. These individuals had marked macrosomia and high incidence of Wilms' tumor. A subset of these patients had 1.4- to 1.8-kb deletions with hypermethylation of the remaining IC1 region and fully penetrant BWS phenotype when transmitted maternally. Another subset of individuals with IC1 hypermethylation had a similar clinical phenotype but no mutation in the local vicinity. All these cases were sporadic and in at least two families affected and unaffected members shared the same maternal IC1 allele but not the abnormal maternal epigenotype. Similarly, no IC1 deletion was detected in 10 nonsyndromic Wilms' tumors with IC1 hypermethylation. In conclusion, methylation defects at the IGF2-H19 locus can result from inherited mutations of the imprinting center and have high recurrence risk or arise independently from the sequence context and not transmitted to the progeny.
