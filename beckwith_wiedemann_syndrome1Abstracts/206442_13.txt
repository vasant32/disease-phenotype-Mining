A girl with hemihypertrophy and hamartomas, now 14 years old, had Wilms' tumor and subsequently developed adrenocortical carcinoma. The occurrence of the two tumors with the signs of an inborn defect of growth control supports the hypothesis that both tumors can be caused by the same etiologic factors, which are also teratogenic. An alternative explanation of induction of the second tumor by previous radio- and chemotherapy is discussed. Possible relationships between our case and the syndrome of Wiedemann and Beckwith are pointed out.
