PURPOSE: We evaluated the outcome of fetuses with prenatally diagnosed undescended testes at 35 weeks or more of gestation. METHODS: We identified the fetuses in our database in whom undescended testes were identified sonographically in the last month of pregnancy and for whom outcome information could be obtained. Associated sonographic abnormalities were tabulated from the original reports. Outcomes were obtained through reviews of the pediatric medical records and pathology reports. RESULTS: Six fetuses in 5 patients (1 had twins) were identified as having an empty scrotum at 35 weeks or later. In 3 fetuses, this finding was the only prenatal sonographic abnormality. One of these fetuses had isolated undescended testes at birth; the twins were found at birth to be females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and severe masculinization of the genitals. The other 3 fetuses had other malformations seen prenatally, including omphalocele and macroglossia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), a left diaphragmatic hernia, and multiple congenital abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Although the finding of undescended testes in late gestation may be noted in an otherwise normal fetus, it may also be associated with a potential risk for perinatal problems ranging from severe multiple congenital abnormalities to incorrect sex assignment due to masculinization of female genitalia.
