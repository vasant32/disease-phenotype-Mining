Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is clinically and molecularly very heterogenous. Molecular findings characteristic of BWS have been reported in individuals with no or few associated features. We report on a child with isolated cardiac tumor and a constitutional H19 hypermethylation with none of the features of BWS.
