The authors report a case of a virilizing adrenal tumor that developed in a 2-year-old child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). He had a fetal diagnosis of omphalocele and a history of neonatal adrenal cysts. The importance of prenatal diagnosis of BWS and postnatal follow-up of tumors is discussed. The differential diagnosis of adrenal pathologies occurring in BWS also is reviewed.
