One consequence of genomic imprinting is that loss of the transcriptionally active chromosomal homologue causes a change in gene expression that might permit surveillance of chromosome-loss events. Possible selective advantages of such surveillance include protection against cancer and early elimination of monosomic and trisomic fetuses. Potential mechanisms for such surveillance are discussed.
