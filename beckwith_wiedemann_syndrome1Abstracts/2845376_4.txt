We present a male newborn (weight 4000 g) who died at age 12 days with a clinical history of persistent hypoglycemia and polycythemia. Clinical examination disclosed somatic hemihypertrophy (left side), a large umbilical hernia, macroglossia, and an intraabdominal tumor, consistent with the diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (EMG syndrome) and hemihypertrophy. Necropsy findings included visceromegaly (left kidney and adrenal), cytomegaly of the fetal cortex and nodular arrangement of both adrenals, diffuse nesidioblastosis and islet cell hyperplasia of the pancreas, and persistent glomerulogenesis. The tumor was a cystic pancreatoblastoma attached to the anterior surface of the pancreas. Three other examples of this association, congenital pancreatoblastoma and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, all in males, are on record in the literature, indicating a strong relationship between both conditions.
