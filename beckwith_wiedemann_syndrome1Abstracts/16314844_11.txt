The region of human chromosome 11p15.5 is linked with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome that is associated with susceptibility to Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatoblastoma. TSSC5 (tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment cDNA; also known as ORCTL2/IMPT1/BWR1A/SLC22A1L) is located in the region. The expression of TSSC5 and other genes in the region is regulated through paternal imprinting. Mutations and/or reduced expression of TSSC5 have been found in certain tumors. TSSC5 encodes an efflux transporter-like protein with 10 transmembrane domains, whose regulation may affect drug sensitivity, cellular metabolism and growth. Here, we present evidences indicating that RING105, a novel conserved RING-finger protein with a PA (protease-associated) domain and a PEST sequence, is a ubiquitin ligase for TSSC5 that can function in concert with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH6. The polyubiquitin target site on TSSC5 was mapped to a region in the 6th hydrophilic loop. Ectopic expression of RING105 in HeLa cells caused an accumulation of cells during G1 that was not observed with the expression of a form of RING105 in which a residue within the RING finger was mutated to inactivate its ligase activity. UbcH6-RING105 may define a novel ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that targets TSSC5 in mammalian cells.
