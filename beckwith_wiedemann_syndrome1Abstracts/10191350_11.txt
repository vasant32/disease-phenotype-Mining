The nomenclature and occurrence of chorangioma of the placenta are reviewed here. Recurrence of multiple chorangiomas has been described, but it is apparently an uncommon or underreported event. There is a strong relationship between placental chorangiomas and gestation at high altitude, suggesting the occurrence of vascular growth factors induced by hypoxia. Fluid transitions may exist between chorangioma, chorangiomatosis, and chorangiosis, although the latter is common in diabetic pregnancies, whereas chorangiomas are not so correlated.
