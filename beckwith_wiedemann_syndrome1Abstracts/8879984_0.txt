This review has briefly considered some of the vast amount of information that has been gathered on genomic imprinting and its role in PWS, AS, BWS and Russell-Silver syndrome. The pace of investigation into the phenomenon of imprinting will undoubtedly continue, because our understanding remains far from complete. Newer approaches to identifying imprinted genes based on their expression rather than their location are likely to uncover currently unknown genes. We can also look forward to more insight into the fascinating complexities of the imprinting process.
