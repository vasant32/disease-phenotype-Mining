CONTEXT: Placental mesenchymal dysplasia is characterized by placentomegaly and may be mistaken for molar pregnancy both clinically and macroscopically because of the presence of "grapelike vesicles." It may be associated with a completely normal fetus, a fetus with growth restriction, or a fetus with features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To review the etiology, molecular pathology, gross and microscopic features, clinical presentation, complications, and differential diagnosis of placental mesenchymal dysplasia. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed and the Medline databases were systematically searched for articles between 1970 and 2006. The following keywords were used: placental mesenchymal dysplasia, mesenchymal hyperplasia, molar pregnancy, pseudomolar pregnancy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and placentomegaly. Relevant references from review articles were also searched. CONCLUSIONS: Placental mesenchymal dysplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis when the ultrasonographic findings show a cystic placenta. Close attention should be paid to fetal morphology for early recognition of fetal complications and to prevent unnecessary termination of pregnancy in cases associated with a normal fetus.
