Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is associated with potential antifibrogenic effects. The effects of HO-1 expression on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays a critical role in the development of renal fibrosis, are unknown. In this study, HO-1(-/-) mice demonstrated significantly more fibrosis after 7 d of unilateral ureteral obstruction compared with wild-type mice, despite similar degrees of hydronephrosis. The obstructed kidneys of HO-1(-/-) mice also had greater macrophage infiltration and renal tubular TGF-beta1 expression than wild-type mice. In addition, the degree of EMT was more extensive in obstructed HO-1(-/-) kidneys, as assessed by alpha-smooth muscle actin and expression of S100A4 in proximal tubular epithelial cells. In vitro studies using proximal tubular cells isolated from HO-1(-/-) and wild-type kidneys confirmed these observations. In conclusion, HO-1 deficiency is associated with increased fibrosis, tubular TGF-beta1 expression, inflammation, and enhanced EMT in obstructive kidney disease. Modulation of the HO-1 pathway may provide a new therapeutic approach to progressive renal diseases.
