We previously reported a family affected by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) deficiency [Yachie et al., 1999]. The proband was a compound heterozygote for a complete loss of exon 2 (the maternal allele) and a two-nucleotide deletion within exon 3 (the paternal allele). In this report, we describe a large genomic deletion (1730 bp) including entire exon 2 in this family as a specific mechanism generating exon-2 absence observed in the HO-1 mRNA. Analysis of the deletion junction demonstrated fusion of a 5' portion of Alu-Sx element with a 3' portion of Alu-Sq element. The junction contained sequences with high homology to the recombinogenic Alu "core" sequence. These structural features of the HO-1 gene suggest homologous recombination associated with Alu element. This study presents the initial characterization of the HO-1 gene defect causing a human case of HO-1 deficiency and provides the molecular basis for understanding this genetic disease.
