<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies evaluating the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have used various methods to address bias and have reported mixed findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the association in a large cohort of residents in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, using multiple methods to address different sources of confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also sought to explore potential effect measure modification by sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 2003-2010 healthcare database of Emilia-Romagna, Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initiators of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>; initiators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> medications served as the comparison group to account for confounding by healthy user bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We followed patients longitudinally to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases in hospital discharge data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used multivariable Cox regression analyses to adjust for confounding by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors and we conducted a sensitivity analysis using propensity score matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, initiators of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> had a lower incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as compared to initiators of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> drugs [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95 % CI 0.69-0.90] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In sex-stratified analyses we observed a protective effect in men (HR 0.77; 95 % CI 0.67-0.88) but not in women (HR 0.96; 95 % CI 0.82-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were similar in propensity score analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for observed risk factors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> initiation versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> drug initiation was associated with a reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in men but not in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While this study is subject to many limitations, it corroborates a previous study that found sex differences in the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
