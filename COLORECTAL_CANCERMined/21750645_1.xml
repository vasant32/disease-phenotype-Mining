<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) + UFT/LV chemotherapy, in which repetitive oral administration of UFT/LV replaces the infusion of 5-FU/LV in the FOLFIRI regimen, has been proposed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, five of 10 patients were injected with a bolus of 5-FU and the other were not injected with it in order to examine the effect of omitting it in terms of pharmacokinetics of 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The treatment consisted of the intravenous infusions of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 at 100 mg/m(2 )and l-LV at 15 mg/m(2), and the injection of a bolus of 5-FU at 500 mg/m(2) on day 1, and the repetitive oral administration of UFT/LV (300 mg/m(2)/day as tegafur + 75 mg/day of LV) on days 1-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 measurements of the plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>, 5-FU and tegafur were made per patient within 48 hr after the start of chemotherapy and the value of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-48)) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration was also determined at 2 weeks to assess long-term exposure to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of 5-FU at 24 hr after the start of treatment were 27.4 ng/mL and 9.4 ng/mL in the patients with and without the bolus injection, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 48 hr, they were 31.3 ng/mL and 10.4 ng/mL with the AUC(0-48) values of 22.16 mg h/L and 0.65 mg h/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-FU was detected in the plasma at 226 hr after the last administration of UFT/LV for the patients with the bolus injection, but not for those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A bolus of 5-FU on day 1 provided long-term exposure to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
