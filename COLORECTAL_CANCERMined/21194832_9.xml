<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that the ginsenoside Rh2 exhibited significantly more potent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> activity than the ginsenoside Rg3 in HCT116 and SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by Rh2 is mediated in part by the caspase-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and in part by the caspase-independent paraptosis, a type of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that is characterized by the accumulation of cytoplasmic vacuoles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells with Rh2 activated the p53 pathway and significantly increased the levels of the pro-apoptotic regulator, Bax, while decreasing the levels of anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> regulator Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of p53 significantly blocked Rh2-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as vacuole formation, suggesting that both types of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> induced by Rh2 are mediated by p53 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that Rh2 increased ROS levels and activated the NF-κB survival pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blockage of ROS by NAC or catalase inhibited the activation of NF-κB signaling and enhanced Rh2-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, suggesting that the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> effect of Rh2 can be enhanced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
