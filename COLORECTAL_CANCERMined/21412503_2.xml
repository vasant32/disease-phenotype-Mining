<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Upregulated CD133 expression in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (Lovo, Colo205, Caco-2, HCT116 and SW620) was analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissue samples were stained with anti-human CD133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SW620 cells were sorted according to the CD133 expression level measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spheroids of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were cultured with the hanging drop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD133 and Lgr5 in spheroids of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and monolayer culture was detected by RT-qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spheroids of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were analyzed using anti-human CD133 with immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD133 antigen was expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (Lovo, Colo205, Caco-2, HCT116 and SW620) as well as in primary and metastatic human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the CD133 was differently expressed in these cell lines and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of CD133 and Lgr5 were significantly higher in spheroids of parental, CD133(hi) and CD133⁻ cells than in their monolayer culture at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining of spheroids of CD133⁻ cells showed that CD133 was highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Upregulated CD133 expression plays a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, which may promote the expression of other critical genes that can drive <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
