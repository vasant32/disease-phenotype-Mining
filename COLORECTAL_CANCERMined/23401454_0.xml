<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No studies report how this process is implemented on a health system-wide basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS Since 2004, Cleveland Clinic has screened <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens with MSI/IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between January 2004 and July 2007, MSI/IHC results went only to the colorectal surgeon (approach 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between August 2007 and June 2008, colorectal surgeons and a genetic counselor received the MSI/IHC results, and the counselor e-mailed the colorectal surgeon regarding appropriate patients for genetic counseling (GC) referral (approach 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After July 2008, the colorectal surgeon and counselor received MSI/IHC results, but the counselor contacted the patient to facilitate referral (approach 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In approaches 2 and 3, patients were presumed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> if the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lacked MLH1 expression and was also BRAF mutated or if the patient was diagnosed at age greater than 72 years and had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results Abnormal MSI/IHC results occurred in 178 (16%) of 1,108 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In approach 1, 21 (55%) of 38 patients with abnormal MSI/IHC were referred for GC, 12 (32%) of 38 underwent GC, and 10 (26%) of 38 underwent genetic testing (GT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In approach 2, nine (82%) of 11 patients were referred for GC, seven (64%) of 11 underwent GC, and five (45%) of 11 underwent GT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In approach 3, 56 (100%) of 56 patients were referred for GC, 40 (71%) of 56 underwent GC, and 37 (66%) of 56 underwent GT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time from referral to GC was 10-fold quicker in approach 3 than approach 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION Implementation of universal MSI/IHC with GC/GT, along with effective multidisciplinary communication and plans of responsibility for patient contact, resulted in increased identification of patients with LS </plain></SENT>
