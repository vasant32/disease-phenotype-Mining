<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A list of errors comparing the database with the National Patient Registry is drawn up monthly and has been used for data completeness analysis for several years as part of the department's daily routine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In May 2009, this system was revised and we identified a number of new errors which we previously thought had been corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nature of these errors has been analysed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the National Patients Registry, a total of 1,530 patients were treated for a first-time <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 60 cases (3.9%) patients were missing in the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erroneous registration of the diagnosis in the National Patient Registry on the part of the department was the primary reason why data were missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was followed by clerical errors at the department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mistakes were explainable, but changes in the registry structure prevented some of the mistakes discovered from being corrected retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of missing patients in the database could be minimized by a meticulous effort at controlling data and comparing them with data in national registries </plain></SENT>
