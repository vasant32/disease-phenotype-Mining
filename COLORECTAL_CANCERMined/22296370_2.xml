<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effects of GSTT1 polymorphism on the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature search of PubMed and EMBASE up to June 7, 2011 was conducted and 13 eligible papers were finally selected, involving totals of 4,832 CRC cases and 7,045 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses were performed according to the sample size and the research design with the software programs Review Manager (version 5.0.10) and STATA (version 9.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analyses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant studies showed an increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was significantly associated with the null genotypes of GSTT1 (OR=1.09, 95%CI=1.01-1.17, POR=0.027; I2=40.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides, a more obvious association was observed after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was eliminated (OR=1.13, 95%CI 1.04-1.23, POR=0.002; I2=0.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis further identified an association in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated the GSTT1 null genotype to be associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
