<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical features usually initiate evaluation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch Syndrome</z:e> (LS) but some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) histopathology findings are compatible with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) that also occurs in LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This led to the suggestion that pathologists request MSI analysis, which is an expensive addition to routine histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to see if a Gastrointestinal Pathologist could identify MSI-H features with reproducibility and high (95%) specificity (MSI-H 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> received during 2005 and 4 MSI-H controls were scored using 2 published methods, "MsScore" and "PathScore" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSI analysis was performed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> scored by either method as probable MSI-H 95% and results compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To examine reproducibility of histopathology, 100 coded slides, including 25 scored MSI-H 95% and 75 scored low, were re-examined to now identify those needing MSI analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Costs were evaluated for identifying MSI-H with or without scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 227 CRCs were scored for possible MSI-H 95%; 24 had high scores and MSI analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis proved 14 MSI-H, PathScore identified 13 (95%), MsPath identified 9 (64%), histopathology alone identified 7 (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility for identifying histopathology characteristics of MSI-H at re-examination, without scoring, was "moderate agreement" (Kappa statistic = 0.4615) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Costs for identifying MSI-H by PathScore were the lowest, $436/identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions; PathScore identified the most proven MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> at lowest cost and even an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist has difficulties identify MSI-H without scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So, scoring can be facilitated by a computerized evaluation form for routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> histology, prompting score computation and recommendation for MSI analysis with high specificity </plain></SENT>
