<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The loop-hybrid mobility shift assay (LH-MSA) was previously developed for the rapid detection of the EGFR mutation L858R for predicting clinical responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, clinical importance of determining KRAS mutations has been demonstrated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> harboring mutated KRAS genes were not responsive to therapy with EGFR-targeted antibodies such as cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a new version of the LH-MSA using an insert-type LH generator that was capable of detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Feasibility evaluation was performed with this new LH-MSA on 215 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KRAS codon 12 mutations were detected in 23% specimens and codon 13 mutations in 6.5% specimens by LH-MSA at a rate better than by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using the new method, the G13D mutation was readily distinguishable from other KRAS mutations in codon 12 and, therefore, would be advantageous for clinical applications </plain></SENT>
