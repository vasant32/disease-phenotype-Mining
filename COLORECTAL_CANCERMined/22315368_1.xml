<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colorectal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (GC) are associated with meat intake and tobacco smoke, maybe because of aromatic compounds occurring in tobacco smoking and formed during cooking meat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated metabolites of these compounds may bind to DNA forming bulky adducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight subjects diagnosed of GC and 154 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> during a 7-year follow-up period in the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition-Spain cohort were compared with a sample of 296 subjects using a case-cohort approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aromatic adducts to DNA from leukocytes collected at recruitment were measured by means of the (32)P-postlabeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted by relevant confounders were estimated by a modified version of Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the log(2)-transformed adduct concentration, we observed a RR = 1.57 (CI: 1.25-1.97) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which means a 57% increased risk associated with doubling the level of adducts, and 47% (RR = 1.47, CI: 1.07-2.00) increase in risk of GC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association was more marked for colon than for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527408,C0034885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level of aromatic adducts in the DNA is independently associated with an increased risk of gastric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect could be due to aromatic compounds present in tobacco smoke or formed in meat, but they could be also due to genotoxic compounds from other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Sources of aromatic compounds should be taken into account, in addition to known risk factors, in the research and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of the stomach</z:e>, colon, and rectum </plain></SENT>
