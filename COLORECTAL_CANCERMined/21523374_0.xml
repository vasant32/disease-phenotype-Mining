<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of KRAS mutation status on the outcomes was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Literature retrieval, trials selection and assessment, data collection, and statistical analysis were performed according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials, comprising totally 2,912 patients, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis showed higher response rate (RR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14-3.26) and significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.95) in cetuximab-chemotherapy groups versus chemotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding overall survival (OS; HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87-1.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS patients, treatment with cetuximab plus chemotherapy significantly increased response rate (RR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20-1.73) and improved PFS (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84), as compared with chemotherapy groups, but not for OS (HR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.64-1.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mutant KRAS patients, there was no significant difference between those treated with cetuximab plus chemotherapy and those with chemotherapy alone regarding response rate (RR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.08), PFS (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 0.81-2.31), and OS (HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.74-1.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of grade 3/4 rash, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> was significantly increased in cetuximab combination groups as compared with chemotherapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of cetuximab in addition to chemotherapy was a valid alternative for patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Benefit of cetuximab was only limited to patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
