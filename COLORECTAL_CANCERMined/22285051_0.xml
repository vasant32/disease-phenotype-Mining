<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The EURECCA (European Registration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Care) consortium is currently formed by nine independently founded national colorectal audit registrations, of which most already run for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cumulative experience of EURECCA's participants could be used to identify a 'core dataset' that covers <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> important aspects needed for high quality auditing and at the same time lacking needless data items that only consumes administrative effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to compare the data items used by the nine registries participating in EURECCA to identify a core dataset and explore options for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> colorectal outcome registrations participating in the EURECCA project were asked to supply a list with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the data items they score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Items were scored 'present' if they appeared literally in a registration or in case they could be calculated using other items in the same registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The definition of a 'shared data item' was that at least eight of the nine participating registries scored the item </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of registered data items varied between 254 (Belgium) and 83 (Norway) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 45 variables were patient data, data about preoperative staging, surgical treatment, pre- or postoperative radio- and/or chemotherapy, and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Items about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> recurrence or quality of life were scored too little to become shared data items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A total of 45 items were collected by 8 or more of the participating registries and subsequently met the criteria for a shared data item </plain></SENT>
