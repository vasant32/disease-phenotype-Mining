<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the proportion of patients who underwent CTC in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who had undergone CTC in the period 1 January 2007 to 1 January 2011 were merged with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recorded in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry between 1 January 2007 and 1 July 2011 to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had undergone CTC less than 2 years before <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had been diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 53 out of 1,855 patients who had undergone CTC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 40 patients had suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 5 had large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> at CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In five patients with an indeterminate mass, further investigation confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the caecum was missed because of poor distension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were missed: one in the distal rectum and one in the ascending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of CTC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 94.3 % (95 % CI 88-100 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The true miss rate, excluding the inadequate distended study, was 2 out of 53 (3.8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that the miss rate for CTC is low, which means that CTC is accurate in excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in symptomatic patients at a relatively low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS : • The miss rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) on CT colonography (CTC) is low. • CTC is accurate at excluding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in symptomatic patients. • CTC is the method of choice in symptomatic patients to exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
