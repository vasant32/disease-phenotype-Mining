<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A direct comparison of Hemoccult II with two immunochemical quantitative tests (OC-Sensor and FOB-Gold) using a 2-sample strategy was performed in over 30,000 patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positivity ratio between immunochemical tests and Hemoccult II varied between 2.2 (OC-Sensor) and 2.4 (FOB-Gold) for the lowest cut-off value and 1.5-1.4 for the highest cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was similar for immunochemical tests and Hemoccult II, and significantly higher for immunochemical tests for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> was higher with immunochemical tests than with Hemoccult II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the 2-sample strategy and the lowest cut-off value the detection rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> almost doubled and for advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> quadrupled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening with immunochemical faecal occult blood tests, an acceptable strategy would be 2-day sampling with at least one positive test at a cut-off between 150 and 200 ng/mL (OC-Sensor) and 176 and 234 ng/mL (FOB-Gold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data on the ease of test interpretation and cost-effectiveness now necessary to make definitive choices </plain></SENT>
