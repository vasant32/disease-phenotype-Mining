<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the effect of preoperative immunonutrition and different nutritional models on the clinical condition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were grouped into 4 groups according to their nutrition regimens randomly and were given immunonutrition (IMN), standard enteral (SE), total parental nutrition (TPN), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nutrition (NN) regimens, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which contained the same calorie-nitrogen content within a 7-day preoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an endoscopic biopsy before and after the regimen, and the lymphocyte population infiltrating mucosal parts of the resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue specimens was performed by staining with antihuman CD4(+), CD8(+), CD16(+), and CD56(+) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After nutrition, there were significant increases in each of the 4 groups of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the rates of augmentation, the increased rates of the CD8(+) cells infiltrating the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> after nutrition in the patients who were fed with IMN were significantly more than the ones in other groups (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD16(+) cell infiltration was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups except the SE and IMN groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SE group had increased CD56(+) cell infiltration compared with the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who had nutrition in the 7-day preoperative period, except for the SE nutrition group, there were significant increases of infiltration of CD56(+) cells at the mucosal part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue within the CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When postnutrition values were compared, there was a marked increase of CD8(+) cells in the IMN group </plain></SENT>
