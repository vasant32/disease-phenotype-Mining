<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied whether HSP90α was associated with the special carbohydrate structures IMH-2 epitopes, and investigated its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and clinical relevance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The lysates and the culture media of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> HCT-8 cells were immunoprecipitated with IMH-2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry or by immunoblotting with anti-HSP90α antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro wound-healing assay was done to evaluate the role of IMH-2 epitope-associated HSP90α in HCT-8 cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR was performed to detect the levels of HSP90α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in paired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues of 56 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> HSP90α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and poor survival outcome was determined by statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HSP90α was first identified as an IMH-2 epitope-associated protein by immunoprecipiation, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IMH-2 epitopes were detected in both cellular and secreted HSP90α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HCT-8 cell migration induced by serum starvation-conditioned medium was blocked by anti-HSP90α antibody or the HSP90α inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) as efficient as by IMH-2 antibody, suggesting that IMH-2-associated HSP90α was involved in serum starvation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, HSP90α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was induced in HCT-8 cells after serum starvation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 15 (26.8%) of 56 CRC patients exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> HSP90α <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> overexpression and had higher rates of metastatic occurrence (P = 0.003) and poor prognosis (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HSP90α was an IMH-2 epitope-associated protein </plain></SENT>
