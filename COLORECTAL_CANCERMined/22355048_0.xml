<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 protein expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) are well-established tools to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> (LS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centers have adopted these tools as reflex LS screening after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosis, the standard of care has not been established, and no formal studies have described this practice in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe prevalent practices regarding IHC/MSI reflex testing for LS in the United States and the subsequent follow-up of abnormal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-item survey was developed after interdisciplinary expert input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A letter of invitation, survey, and online-survey option were sent to a contact at each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A modified Dillman strategy was used to maximize the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sample included 39 National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute-designated Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Centers (NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCCs</z:chebi>), 50 randomly selected American College of Surgeons-accredited Community Hospital Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Programs (COMPs), and 50 Community Hospital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Programs (CHCPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one percent of NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCCs</z:chebi>, 36% of COMPs, and 15% of CHCPs were conducting reflex IHC/MSI for LS; 48% of the programs used IHC, 14% of the programs used MSI, and 38% of the programs used both IHC and MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One program used a presurgical information packet, four programs offered an opt-out option, and none of the programs required written consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although most NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCCs</z:chebi> use reflex IHC/MSI to screen for LS, this practice is not well-adopted by community hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings may indicate an emerging standard of care and diffusion from NCI-<z:chebi fb="61" ids="32879">CCC</z:chebi> to community <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings also described an important trend away from requiring written patient consent for screening </plain></SENT>
