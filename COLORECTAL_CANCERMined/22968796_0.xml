<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors associated with willingness to undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for personal and public health benefit among women from diverse race/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We interviewed women aged 50 to 80 from four racial/ethnic groups from primary care clinics in 2003-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We asked about demographics, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening knowledge and history, perceived risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and about the outcomes of intention to be screened for personal benefit and for public health benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 492 women who completed the interview, 32 % were White, 16 % were African American, 21 % were Latina and 32 % were Asian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up-to-date screening was reported by 77 % of women, with similar numbers obtaining fecal occult blood test (FOBT) within 2 years or colonoscopy within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of women were "likely or very likely" to get FOBT or colonoscopy after learning the benefits and risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models showed that compared to Whites, fewer Asians would undergo colonoscopy (OR = 0.28; 95 % CI: 0.12, 0.63), while more Latinas would undergo colonoscopy (OR = 6.14; 95 % CI: 1.77, 21.34) and obtain regular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI: 1.66, 12.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority would obtain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening even if they would not personally benefit; those who perceived themselves to be at higher than average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk were more likely to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for public health benefit (OR = 2.32; 95 % CI: 1.32, 4.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women are willing to undergo screening for personal benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asians were less likely, and Latinas more likely, to accept colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most are also willing to undergo screening for public health benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Self-perceived risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was the most consistent predictor of willingness and intention to be screened for either personal or public health benefit </plain></SENT>
