<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> is dependent upon their ability to acquire and maintain an adequate blood supply; however, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is an irregular process leading to chaotic and hyperpermeable vessels that may result in increased intratumoral pressure and poor exchange of macromolecules and oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> can both impair the formation of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> blood vessels and possibly 'normalize' the existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1658953" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor vasculature</z:e>, causing a more efficient delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapies (CTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last decade, therapies that target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have become a component of treatment for several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the combination of bevacizumab with established chemotherapeutic regimens for mCRC has been shown to improve overall and progression-free survival, as well as response rates, over CT alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agents that target various members of the VEGF family, as well as signaling by the VEGF receptors and their tyrosine kinase components, are currently under development and evaluation in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integration of these new therapies into the treatment of mCRC will ultimately increase the available therapeutic options for patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Still, many challenges remain, including identifying and validating relevant biomarkers to guide the optimal use of antiangiogenesis agents </plain></SENT>
