<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The input brought by nanotechnology is presented with particular stress on the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51338">dendrimers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These unique "polymeric compounds" after modification can form intelligent species, transporting drugs into specific areas and at the same time can be used for monitoring the state of organs attacked by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, as well as the progress of the curing process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They can help to limit the anticancer drugs delivery to designed goals only, eliminating many side effects of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> are major problem for public health care in many countries <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During last twenty years a dramatic increase in incidence of both of them has been observed, especially in industrialized countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probably, both of them are caused, apart from the hereditary syndromes, by specific point mutation, some hormonal factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and by the strong co-influence of environmental factors and dietary exposure of a patient </plain></SENT>
