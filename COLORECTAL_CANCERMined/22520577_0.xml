<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi>, one of the major components of cigarette smoking, can stimulate cell proliferation and suppress <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells and in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines derived from various organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, although <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> appears to have a role in stimulating cell proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells, there is no information on its role in inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-8 were treated with 1 μM <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> alone or in combination with 1 μM α-BTX in complete or in serum free medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were determined by cell count performed with a cell counter and by cytofluorimetric assay respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PI3K/Akt and PKC/ERK1/2 pathways, survivin, and P-Bcl2 (Ser70) were investigated by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> induced an increase in cell proliferation and a decrease of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in Caco-2 and HCT-8 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> appear to be mediated by α7-nicotinic <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> receptors, since treatment with α-Bungarotoxin inhibited these processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi> induced a statistically significant increase in the expression of PI3K and in P-Akt/Akt ratio as well as in the expression of PKC, ERK1/2, survivin, and P-Bcl2 (Ser70) in both cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">Nicotine</z:chebi>, contained in cigarette smoking, could participate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development and progression by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing physiological <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
