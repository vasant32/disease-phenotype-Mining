<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysregulated signaling through the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/RAF/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway due to mutations in K-Ras and B-Raf are common events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incidence of mutations in codons 12 and 13 of K-Ras and exons 11 and 15 of B-Raf were analyzed in amplified PCR products from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumors</z:e> of 273 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and their prognostic and predictive significance was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognostic role of clinical and pathological factors was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: K-Ras mutations were present in 89 patients (32.6%), of whom 76 (85.4%) had mutations in codon 12 and 10 (11.2%) had mutations in codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B-Raf gene mutations were present in 17 patients (6.9%), of whom 6 (35.3%) had mutations in exon 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed a predictive significance for K-Ras mutations with respect to time to progression in patients treated with irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no predictive significance for B-Raf gene mutation status in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following risk factors were found to affect overall survival (OS) rates: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> location, lymph node involvement grade, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before treatment, and performance status according to WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, K-Ras mutation status may be a suitable indicator of patient eligibility and a prognostic indicator for responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy alone, or in combination with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, K-Ras mutation status may predict time to progression in patients treated with irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
