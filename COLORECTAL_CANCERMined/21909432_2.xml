<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify molecular networks and biological processes that are deregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa, we applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to two independent transcriptome datasets, including a total of 137 CRC and ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-two gene sets as described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database had significantly altered gene expression in both datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included networks associated with cell division, DNA maintenance, and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among signaling pathways with known changes in key genes, the "Phosphatidylinositol signaling network", comprising part of the PI3K pathway, was found deregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The downregulated genes in this pathway included several members of the Phospholipase C protein family, and the reduced expression of two of these, PLCD1 and PLCE1, were successfully validated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biopsies (n = 70) and cell lines (n = 19) by quantitative analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The repression of both genes was found associated with KRAS mutations (P = 0.005 and 0.006, respectively), and we observed that microsatellite stable <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with reduced PLCD1 expression more frequently had TP53 mutations (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Promoter methylation analyses of PLCD1 and PLCE1 performed in cell lines and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> biopsies revealed that methylation of PLCD1 can contribute to reduced expression in 40% of the microsatellite instable <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified significantly deregulated pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and validated repression of PLCD1 and PLCE1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This illustrates that the GSEA approach may guide discovery of novel biomarkers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
