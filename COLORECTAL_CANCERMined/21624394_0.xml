<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We studied whether individual socioeconomic and neighborhood factors such as living in a poor community independently affected health screening participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 3 blocks of public-rental flats (the poorer neighborhood) adjacent to 3 blocks of owner-occupied public housing (the better-off neighborhood) in a precinct in Taman Jurong, Singapore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic details and reasons for not having regular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening were collected from 2009 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An access-enhancing intervention was implemented in both neighborhoods to raise health screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participation rates for rental flats and owner-occupied flats were 89.0% (356/400) and 70.2% (351/500) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Living in a better-off neighborhood was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (66% vs. 35%, adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.12, p&lt;0.01), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (53% vs. 26%, AOR=4.34, p&lt;0.01) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (17% vs. 6%, AOR=15.43, p&lt;0.01), as were individual socioeconomic factors such as employment, need for financial aid and household income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Uptake of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening modalities significantly increased in the poorer neighborhood post-intervention (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cost was cited more commonly as a barrier to health screening in the poorer neighborhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differing neighborhoods within one geographical location, as well as individual socioeconomic factors, were independently associated with differences in health screening </plain></SENT>
