<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of registry data accumulated prospectively were used in conjunction with the data obtained from patient notes to identify outcome data for octogenarians who had undergone elective laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections were performed in 68 octogenarians between 2003 and 2011 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four operations (6%) were converted to an open technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were twelve cases of morbidity (18%) and two cases of mortality (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall median hospital stay was 8 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time for a patient to be deemed surgically fit for discharge was 5 d reflecting a delay in provision of social care or stoma education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support the view that laparoscopic surgery in octogenarians is safe, feasible and with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001258'>reduced length</z:mp> of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is well reflected in our results which are compatible with United Kingdom national figures </plain></SENT>
