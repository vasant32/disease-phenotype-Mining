<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cellular signaling networks typically involves targeted measurements of phosphorylated protein intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, phosphoproteomic analyses usually require affinity enrichment of phosphopeptides and can be complicated by artifactual changes in phosphorylation caused by uncontrolled preanalytical variables, particularly in the analysis of tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We asked whether changes in protein expression, which are more stable and easily analyzed, could reflect network stimulation and inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We employed this approach to analyze stimulation and inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by EGF and selective EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shotgun analysis of proteomes from proliferating A431 cells, EGF-stimulated cells, and cells co-treated with the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49668">gefitinib</z:chebi> identified groups of differentially expressed proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of these protein groups identified 13 proteins whose EGF-induced expression changes were reversed by both EGFR inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeted multiple reaction monitoring analysis verified differential expression of 12 of these proteins, which comprise a candidate EGFR inhibition signature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We then tested these 12 proteins by multiple reaction monitoring analysis in three other models: 1) a comparison of DiFi (EGFR inhibitor-sensitive) and HCT116 (EGFR-insensitive) cell lines, 2) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse xenograft DiFi and HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 3) in tissue biopsies from a patient with the gastric hyperproliferative disorder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ménétrier's disease</z:e> who was treated with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the proteins in the candidate signature, a core group, including c-Jun, Jagged-1, and Claudin 4, were decreased by EGFR inhibitors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the goal of these studies was not to validate a clinically useful EGFR inhibition signature, the results confirm the hypothesis that clinically used EGFR inhibitors generate characteristic protein expression changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This work further outlines a prototypical approach to derive and test protein expression signatures for drug action on signaling networks </plain></SENT>
