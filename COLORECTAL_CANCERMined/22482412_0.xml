<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To construct and express the recombinant ND-1-scFv/SEA, a fusion protein of superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxinA, SEA) and single-chain variable fragment of monoclonal antibody ND-1 against human clolorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, and to enhance the targeted killing effect of SEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of the fusion protein was induced in E.coli M15 by IPTG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ni-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39054">NTA</z:chebi> resin affinity chromatography was used to separate and purify the expressed product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific binding activity of the purified ND-1-scFv/SEA protein was examined by indirect immunofluorescence assay and the targeted-cytotoxicity was determined using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expressing vector of fusion gene ND-1scFv/SEA was constructed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ND-1-scFv/SEA protein retained a high binding affinity to antigen-positive human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell <z:chebi fb="15" ids="3478">CCL</z:chebi>-187 and had a stronger capability to activate PBMC and kill the target cells compared to SEA alone, with a killing rate of 91% at 4 Î¼g/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ND-1-scFv/SEA fusion protein could specifically target <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell, enhance the activity of kill <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell and has potential applications in the targeted therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
