<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While the evidence-base concerning the economic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for patients and their families/carers has grown in recent years, there is little known about how emotional responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> influence this economic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the economic costs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the context of patients' emotions and how these both shaped the patient and family burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Health professionals from six hospitals invited patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (ICD10 C18-C20) within the previous year to take part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with patients and, where available, a family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interviews covered medical and non-medical costs incurred as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and the impact of these on the lives of the patient and their family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interviews were audio-recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recordings were transcribed verbatim and these data were analysed qualitatively using thematic content analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (17 colon and 5 rectal; 14 women and 8 men) were interviewed; 6 were accompanied by a family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related financial outlays included: travel and parking associated with hospital appointments; costs of procedures; increased household bills; and new clothing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> impacted on employed individuals' ability to work and depressed their income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The opportunity cost of informal care for carers/family members, especially immediately post-diagnosis, was a strong theme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients spoke of the emotional burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and described how this burden could lead to further costs for themselves and their families by limiting work and hindering their ability to efficiently manage their expenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some patients also spoke of how economic and emotional burdens could interact with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Support from employers, family/carers and the state/health services and patients' own attitudes influenced this inter-relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The economic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on patients and their families is complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the economic costs and the emotional impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> are often related and can exacerbate each other, but that various factors can meditate this inter-relationship </plain></SENT>
