<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An organized, population-based, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme was initiated in England in 2006 offering biennial faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to adults aged 60-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Organized screening programmes with no associated financial costs to the individual should minimize barriers to access for lower socio-economic status (SES) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, SES differences in uptake were observed in the pilot centres of the UK programme, so the aim of this analysis was to identify the extent of inequalities in uptake by SES, ethnic diversity, gender and age in the first 28 months of the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design Cross-sectional analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening uptake data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2006 and January 2009, over 2.6 million adults aged 60-69 years were mailed a first FOBT kit by the five regional screening hubs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uptake was defined as return of a test kit within 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used multivariate generalized linear regression to examine variation by area-based socioeconomic deprivation, area-based ethnicity, gender and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uptake was 54%, but showed a gradient across quintiles of deprivation, ranging from 35% in the most deprived quintile to 61% in the least deprived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses confirmed an independent effect of deprivation, with stronger effects in women and older people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most ethnically diverse areas also had lower uptake (38%) than other areas (52-58%) independent of SES, age, gender and regional screening hub </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ethnic disparities were more pronounced in men but equivalent across age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>More women than men returned a kit (56 vs 51%), but there was also an interaction with age, with uptake increasing with age in men (49% at 60-64 years; 53% at 65-69 years) but not women (57 vs 56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall uptake rates in this organized screening programme were encouraging, but nonetheless there was low uptake in the most ethnically diverse areas and a striking gradient by SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Action to promote equality of uptake is needed to avoid widening inequalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
