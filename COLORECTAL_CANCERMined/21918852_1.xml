<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether asymptomatic Hispanics undergoing colonoscopy screening also have lower age-adjusted incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such data could be used to formulate future screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The objectives of this study were to measure and analyze the prevalence and location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> sized ≥ 10 mm in asymptomatic white and Hispanic patients who received colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonoscopy data were prospectively collected from the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative database, which includes data from a consortium of 66 adult gastrointestinal practice sites in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic white (n = 146,798) and Hispanic (n = 7,654) patients who received colonoscopy screening from 2004 to 2007 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm and of proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm was adjusted for age, sex, practice site type, and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference between prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm in Hispanic and white patients (5.8% vs. 6.2%; P = 0.11; adjusted OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85-1.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was also no significant difference between prevalence of proximal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm in Hispanics and whites (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.87-1.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥ 10 mm for Hispanic patients undergoing colonoscopy screening is similar to that for whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize the importance of encouraging timely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings support the application of similar recommendations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening of Hispanics and whites </plain></SENT>
