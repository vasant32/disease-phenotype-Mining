<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been conflicting reports regarding both the clinicopathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young patients and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review and compare the clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and overall survival of patients in three different age groups (40 years and under, 41-50 years, over 50 years of age) and the prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2,426 consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at Singapore General Hospital in the period from 2000 to 2005 were retrieved from a prospectively collected computer database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 73 patients (3.0 %) in Group 1 (40 years old or less), 257 (10.6 %) in Group 2 (41-50 years old), and 2,096 (86.4 %) in Group 3 (&gt;50 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathological features were assessed using univariate analysis to evaluate significant differences, survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the independent prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients tend to present with a higher incidence of mucinous and signet ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (Group 1-20.5 %, Group 2-8.2 %, Group 3-6.2 %, p &lt; 0.001) and have more poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (Group 1-20.0 %, Group 2-9.7 %, Group 3-7.4 %, p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients tend to present with regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> (Group 1-65.7 %, Group 2-60.8 %, Group 3-51.0 %, p = 0.001) and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (Group 1-31.5 %, Group 2-24.1 %, Group 3-19.4 %, p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis reveals, however, that young age is not an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) (p = 0.392) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year CSS for Group 1 was 56.6 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 44.8-68.4 %), Group 2 53.8 % (95 % CI 47.3-60.3 %), and Group 3 61.1 % (95 % CI 58.9-63.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although presenting with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and with poorer prognostic factors such as presence of mucin and poor histological differentiation, young <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients do not have a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
