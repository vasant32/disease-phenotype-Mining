<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Netherlands Cohort Study includes 120,852 participants who completed a self-administered questionnaire in 1986 when they were aged 55-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By 2002, 1,819 male and 1,366 female <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases were available for case-cohort analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In men, higher occupational energy expenditure levels and fewer occupational sitting hours were associated with decreased hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, particularly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (occupational energy expenditure of ≥12 vs. &lt;8 kJ/minute, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.97; P for trend = 0.01; occupational sitting hours of &lt;2 vs. 6-8 hours/day, HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.83; P for trend = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the longest held job for male subcohort members was 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonoccupational physical activity was inconsistently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> endpoints in men, and it was inversely associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in women, particularly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (&gt;90 vs. ≤30 minutes/day, HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96; P for trend = 0.06), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (&gt;90 vs. ≤30 minutes/day, HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.90; P for trend = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, regular long-term physical activity and fewer sitting hours may protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, particularly distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; results for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were mixed </plain></SENT>
