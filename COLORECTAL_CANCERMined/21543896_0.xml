<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mice, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can be induced by treatment with azoxymethane (AOM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a set of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-susceptible A/J and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-resistant C57Bl/6J (B6) progenitors, we previously detected the Ccs3 locus (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility locus 3) as a major regulator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotyping of additional AcB/BcA strains for susceptibility to AOM-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has refined the Ccs3 interval to a 6.7 Mb segment on chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of intermediate susceptibility phenotypes in individual AcB/BcA strains suggested additional gene effects regulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in A/J and B6 strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those were investigated by linkage analysis and whole genome scanning in a set of 208 informative (B6 x A/J)F2 progeny, using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> multiplicity as a quantitative measure of susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis validated the important role of Ccs3 in regulating this trait, and additionally detected contribution from a second locus on the distal portion of chromosome 9 (LOD = 3.76), that was given the temporary designation of Ccs5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ccs5 modulates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> multiplicity in F2 animals bearing at least one A/J-derived susceptibility allele at Ccs3, with A/J-derived Ccs5 susceptibility alleles being inherited in a recessive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is a strong additive effect of Ccs3 and Ccs5 on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> multiplicity in F2 mice: mice doubly homozygotes for A/J or B6 alleles at Ccs3 and Ccs5 show <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> numbers similar to those of parental A/J and B6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the Ccs5 region overlaps several quantitative trait loci previously reported to regulate intestinal homeostasis and susceptibility to intestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in mice and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings identify a novel two-locus system regulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility in mice, of which the relevance to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> can now be tested experimentally </plain></SENT>
