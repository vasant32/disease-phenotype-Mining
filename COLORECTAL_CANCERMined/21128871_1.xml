<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: MTHFR polymorphisms of 86 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients and 100 healthy volunteers were analyzed by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism, and Bcl-2 promoter CGI methylation in 86 CRC tissues and 86 paired nonneoplastic adjacent tissues was determined by methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression in 70 CRC tissues and paired nonneoplastic adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of MTHFR 677 T allele and combined variant genotypes (677CT + TT) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (p = 0.023 and p = 0.035, respectively), and there is a significant association between 677TT or 677(CT + TT) genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR = 2.534, p = 0.045 and OR = 1.888, p = 0.035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of methylated Bcl-2 promoter CGI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues was significantly lower than that in nonneoplastic adjacent tissues (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of methylated Bcl-2 promoter CGI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues of the individuals with CC genotype was significantly higher than that of those with CT/TT genotypes (p = 0.018), there was significant distribution difference of C and T alleles between individuals with methylated and unmethylated Bcl-2 promoter CGI in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues (p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 promoter hypomethylation was significantly correlated with Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues (r = 0.558, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 promoter is hypomethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue, and there is a significant correlation between MTHFR 677 TT or CT/TT genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> or Bcl-2 promoter CGI methylation/oncoprotein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
