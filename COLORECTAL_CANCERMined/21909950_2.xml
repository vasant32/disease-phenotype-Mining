<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively examined these associations in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to calculate cohort-specific relative risks (RRs) and pooled results using a fixed-effects model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We documented 2,114 incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases during up to 22Â years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared highest to lowest quintile of dietary zinc intake, the pooled multivariable RRs (95% CIs) were 0.86 (0.73, 1.02) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 0.92 (0.76, 1.11) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 0.68 (0.47, 0.99) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant inverse association between dietary zinc intake and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was mainly driven by data in women, although the difference in the sex-specific results was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the same comparison, the pooled multivariable RRs (95% CIs) for <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron were 1.10 (0.93, 1.30) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 1.06 (0.88, 1.29) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 1.20 (0.83, 1.75) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations were not significantly modified by alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical activity, menopausal status, or postmenopausal hormone use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total zinc intake, total iron intake, dietary iron intake, and zinc or iron supplement uses were largely not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study does not support strong roles of zinc and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> iron intake in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk; however, a suggestive inverse association of dietary zinc intake with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk in women requires further study </plain></SENT>
