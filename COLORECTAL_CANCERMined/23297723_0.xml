<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper reports on expert consensus on locoregional and interventional therapies for the treatment of advanced CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resection remains the reference treatment for patients with bilateral CRLM and synchronous presentation of primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with oligonodular bilateral CRLM may be candidates for one-stage multiple segmentectomies; two-stage resection with or without portal vein embolization may allow complete resection in patients with more advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After downsizing with preoperative systemic and/or regional therapy, curative-intent hepatectomy requires resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> initial and currently known sites of disease; debulking procedures are not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> and CRLM can safely undergo simultaneous resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Staged resections should be considered for patients in whom the volume of the future liver remnant is anticipated to be marginal or inadequate, who have significant medical comorbid condition(s), or in whom extensive resections are required for the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and/or CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Priority for liver-first or primary-first resection should depend on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e>-related symptoms or concern for the progression of marginally resectable CRLM during treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy delivered by hepatic arterial infusion represents a valid option in patients with liver-only disease, although it is best delivered in experienced centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ablation strategies are not recommended as first-line treatments for resectable CRLM alone or in combination with resection because of high local failure rates and limitations related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size, multiplicity and intrahepatic location </plain></SENT>
