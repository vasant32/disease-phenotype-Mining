<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated p53 protein regulates its downstream genes and subsequently inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> by inducing cell cycle arrest, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, DNA repair, and senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, genes involved in the p53-mediated senescence pathway are not yet fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through the screening of two genome-wide expression profile data sets, one for cells in which exogenous p53 was introduced and the other for senescent fibroblasts, we have identified <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> channel accessory 2 (CLCA2) as a p53-inducible senescence-associated gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLCA2 was remarkably induced by replicative senescence as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in a p53-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found that ectopically expressed CLCA2 induced cellular senescence, and the down-regulation of CLCA2 by small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> caused inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-induced senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the reduced expression of CLCA2 was frequently observed in various kinds of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo>, whereas its expression was not affected in precancerous prostatic intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings suggest a crucial role of p53/CLCA2-mediated senescence induction as a barrier for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
