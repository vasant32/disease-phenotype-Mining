<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and their first-degree relatives at risk of inheriting an identified deleterious mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses considered both family RWB and EWB norms and individual deviations from that norm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses controlled for age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis, number of respondents, and network size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher family RWB was associated with increased depressive symptoms (p &lt; .05) and avoidant cognitions (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher family EWB was related to decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> symptoms (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher family EWB was associated with fecal occult blood testing (p &lt; .01), and family communication about genetic counselling and testing (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses pointed to individual effects of EWB above and beyond family-level effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals with lower EWB than their family had lower perceived risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (p &lt; .05), communicated disease risk information to less family members (p &lt; .05), and were less likely to undergo recent colonoscopies (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants with lower EWB than their family also had higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> worry (p &lt; .01) and increased depressive symptoms (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Findings indicate the importance of assessing individuals within the context of their family network and being aware of family characteristics which may impact individual adjustment to disease risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interventions considering family-level factors may provide efficient pathways to improving psychosocial factors, screening practices, communication about disease risk and genetic testing, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
