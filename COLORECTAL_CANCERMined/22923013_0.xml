<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its overexpression and as gene target in SW480 colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells was confirmed in our previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To seek a more potent way to treat colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> using a gene therapy method, herein, we constructed a multiple short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (shRNA) expression vector containing four shRNAs against the APRIL gene in SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>APRIL expression levels and cell biological behavior were detected after transfection with different kinds of vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, we found that our multiple shRNA vector produced a more significant knockdown effect of APRIL than the vectors containing only one APRIL shRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our findings indicate that silencing APRIL expression in SW480 cells decreased their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> by reducing proliferation, invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, as well as inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, vectors containing multiple shRNAs to silence the expression of APRIL may be exploited as a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
