<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) are among the most common patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cessation of systemic therapy invariably leads to progression of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While partial splenic embolization has been employed successfully to reverse the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo>, the role of laparoscopic splenectomy for this problem has not been completely defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of mCRC patients treated with laparoscopic splenectomy at our institution to reverse severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to chemotherapy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An endpoint assessed was the ability to resume therapy after splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients with mCRC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> requiring cessation of systemic therapy underwent laparoscopic splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> (6) patients had a postsurgical platelet count &gt;150 × 10(3)/μl and resumed chemotherapy after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median platelet count prior to surgery was 66 × 10(3)/μl, and just prior to resuming systemic therapy it was 399.5 × 10(3)/μl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median spleen size was 14.0 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay was 2.8 days and the median time from surgery to resumption of therapy was 23.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic splenectomy appears to offer selected patients with mCRC the opportunity to resume systemic therapy that otherwise would be discontinued due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
