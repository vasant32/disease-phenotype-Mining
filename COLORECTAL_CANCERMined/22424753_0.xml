<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are pursuing carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) in a strategy aimed at targeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-associated changes in glycosylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate lectin-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell interactions we developed a novel cell biosensor in which binding events take place at the cell surface, more closely mimicking an in vivo system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metastatic, SW620, and non-metastatic, SW480, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells were grown on the surface of a tissue-culture compatible <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> coated biosensor chip and housed in a <z:chebi fb="115" ids="46727">quartz</z:chebi> crystal microbalance (QCM) apparatus, the kinetics of binding of a diverse range of lectins was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lectin Helix pomatia agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) has been shown to bind aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> and was produced in recombinant form (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="32514">His-</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>-tagged) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affinity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> was in the nanomolar range to the metastatic SW620 cells but was only in the micromolar range to the non-metastatic SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the dissociation constant (K(D)) of the lectins tested in the new cell biosensor system was an order of magnitude lower (nanomolar range) than has generally been reported with systems such as QCM/SPR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This new cell-biosensor enables molecular interactions to be studied in a more relevant environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An intrinsic problem with developing new biological therapies is the difficulty in determining the affinity with which proteins will interact with intact cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This methodology will be of interest to researchers developing new biological approaches for targeting cell surfaces in a wide range of diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
