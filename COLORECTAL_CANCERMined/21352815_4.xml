<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of NDRG2 in colorectal tissues remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, our results showed that NDRG2 was down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared to benign colorectal tissues by using immunohistochemical staining and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing analysis showed that the reduced NDRG2 expression was accompanied by de novo DNA methylation at the NDRG2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that microRNA-650 (miR-650) targets a homologous DNA region in the promoter region of the NDRG2 gene and represses its expression at the transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reporter assay with 3'untranslated region of NDRG2 cloned downstream of the luciferase gene showed reduced luciferase activity in the presence of miR-650, providing strong evidence that miR-650 is a direct regulator of NDRG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that NDRG2 expression is regulated by promoter methylation and miR-650 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells, and endogenous small noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> induced control of transcription may be a potential system for expressional regulation in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
