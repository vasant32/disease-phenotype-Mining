<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to identify differences among black and white Medicare-insured patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who underwent resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER-Medicare) linked inpatient data from 1986 to 2005 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in short- and long-term outcomes among black vs white patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 125,676 (92.4%) white and 9,891 (7.6%) black patients who met the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Black patients were younger (75.5 vs 77.2 years; P &lt; .001) but had more comorbidities than did white patients (mean Charlson comorbidity index score 3.99 vs 3.87; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Black patients demonstrated greater odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30 to 1.56) and readmission within 30 days (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing 1986 to 1990 vs 2001 to 2005, black patients had greater odds of 30-day readmission (OR, 1.12 vs 1.31) but reduced odds of index in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.84 vs 1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Black patients had worse long-term survival after colorectal surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.25; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> demonstrated increased risk of mortality and readmission after controlling for age, sex, and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although black vs white differences in perioperative mortality decreased over time, disparities in readmission and long-term survival persisted </plain></SENT>
