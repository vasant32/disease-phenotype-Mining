<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To analyze the patterns of recurrence and the prognostic impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian metastases</z:e> (OM) in a population of women with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (CRPC) treated with curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive women with CRPC who underwent curatively intended complete cytoreductive surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy at our institution were retrieved from a prospective database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bilateral oophorectomy or a complementary unilateral oophorectomy was systematically performed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1994 to 2009, among 105 women who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy for CRPC, 62 (60 %) had OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women with and without OM had comparable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153467" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal cancer</z:e> index (PCI) scores (10 vs. 12, respectively, p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 60 (range 5-145) months, median overall survival of women with OM did not differ statistically from that of women without OM (respectively, 36 and 40 months; p = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in 82 % of the patients, distributed similarly between the two groups except for retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence, which occurred in 19 patients (18 %), including 18 with OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only predictive factor for a retroperitoneal relapse was a history of OM (p = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence seems to be linked to OM originating from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and could worsen the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A systematic lymphadenectomy could be evaluated in women with isolated OM or very limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> to analyze the incidence of invaded lymph nodes and study its potential benefit on survival </plain></SENT>
