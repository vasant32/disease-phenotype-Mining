<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to review the postoperative morbidity and mortality data of our institution, a large community hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two surgical oncologists performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the procedures between May 2005 and June 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common pathology being treated was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_303'>pseudomyxoma peritonei</z:mpath> (34 of 57; 59.6%), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (9 of 57; 15.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100003'>peritoneal mesothelioma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0008010'>gastric adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average surgery time was 6.9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately 51% of patients suffered grade 3 or 4 morbidity and there were no perioperative mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreduction with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be performed at our institution with comparable outcomes as academic referral centers </plain></SENT>
