<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, much attention has recently been focused on the identification of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activities as a strategy to suppress the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cocoa is a rich source of bioactive compounds, the present study investigated its anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of forty male rats were fed with control or cocoa-enriched diets (12 %) during 8 weeks and injected with saline or AOM (20 mg/kg body weight) during the third and fourth week (n 10 rats/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, colon samples were evaluated for markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory activity of a cocoa polyphenolic extract (10 μg/ml) was examined in TNF-α-stimulated Caco-2 cells, an in vitro model of experimentally induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signalling pathways involved, including NF-κB and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase family such as c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinases (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38, were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results show that the cocoa-rich diet decreases the nuclear levels of NF-κB and the expression of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as cyclo-oxygenase-2 and inducible NO synthase induced by AOM in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the experiments in Caco-2 cells confirm that cocoa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> effectively down-regulate the levels of inflammatory markers induced by TNF-α by inhibiting NF-κB translocation and JNK phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cocoa <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenols</z:chebi> suppress <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and could be promising in the dietary prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
