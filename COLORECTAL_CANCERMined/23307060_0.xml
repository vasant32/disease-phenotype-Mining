<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aberrant epigenetic signatures are a hallmark of complex multifactorial diseases (including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcomas</z:hpo>, and breast, lung, prostate, liver, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic signatures (DNA methylation, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and microRNA expression, etc) may serve as biomarkers for risk stratification, early detection, and disease classification, as well as targets for therapy and chemoprevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, DNA methylation assays are widely applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue specimens as clinical pathology tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To better understand the interplay between etiological factors, cellular molecular characteristics, and disease evolution, the field of 'molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE)' has emerged as an interdisciplinary integration of 'molecular pathology' and 'epidemiology' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to traditional epidemiological research including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MPE is founded on the unique disease principle, that is, each disease process results from unique profiles of exposomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, microbiomes, and interactomes in relation to the macroenvironment and tissue microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MPE may represent a logical evolution of GWAS, termed 'GWAS-MPE approach' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although epigenome-wide association study attracts increasing attention, currently, it has a fundamental problem in that each cell within one individual has a unique, time-varying epigenome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Having a similar conceptual framework to systems biology, the holistic MPE approach enables us to link potential etiological factors to specific molecular pathology, and gain novel pathogenic insights on causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The widespread application of epigenome (eg, methylome) analyses will enhance our understanding of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, epigenotypes (CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 (long interspersed nucleotide element-1; also called long interspersed nuclear element-1; long interspersed element-1; L1) hypomethylation, etc), and host-disease interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this article, we illustrate increasing contribution of modern pathology to broader public health sciences, which attests pivotal roles of pathologists in the new integrated MPE science towards our ultimate goal of personalized medicine and prevention </plain></SENT>
