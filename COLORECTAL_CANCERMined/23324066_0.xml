<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from monitoring studies using biomarkers in blood samples aiming at early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are presently evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some serological biomarker levels are influenced by the surgical trauma, which may complicate translation of the levels in relation to recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of postoperative surgical interventions during a follow-up period of patients who have undergone surgery for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a prospective multicenter, clinical study, 634 patients resected for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were followed in the outpatient clinic every third month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 165 stage II and III patients, who had been followed for at least 3 years, was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Any recent surgical intervention associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> and/or other diseases were recorded at each visit to the outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 165 patients, 49 developed recurrence (R+), 107 did not (R-) and 11 developed a new primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, including 2 in the R+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Within the 3 years of observation, 78 (47.3%) of the 165 patients underwent 117 (range 1-5) postoperative surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five operations were related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 42 to benign diseases, while none were related to a new primary, malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients resected for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are frequently undergoing surgical procedures in the postoperative follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, postoperative monitoring using soluble biomarker levels, which may be influenced by the surgical trauma, must be adjusted in relation to postoperative surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
