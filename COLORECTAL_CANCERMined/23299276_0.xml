<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> 1 (DBC1) was initially cloned from a region homozygously deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo>, but its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to examine the expression level of DBC1 and assess its prognostic value in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression level of DBC1 in a series of 186 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining results were analyzed and compared statistically with various clinicopathological characters and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the corresponding non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues, a higher expression level of DBC1 was detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue microarray analysis revealed that DBC1 expression is significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> histological grade, TNM stage and metastatic status (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that DBC1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate Cox regression suggested that DBC1 expression, poorly differentiation status and the presence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> predict shorter overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that DBC1 acts as an independent prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DBC1 is over-expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that it might serve as a predictor for selecting patients at high risk of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
