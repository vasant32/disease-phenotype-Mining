<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no controlled studies, randomised or otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to investigate the evidence base that has been used in establishing its status as a standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 51 papers used in a recent systematic review and quantitative synthesis, a citation network analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 344 publications (the 51 index papers and a further 293 cited in them) constitute the citation network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pattern of citation is that of a citation cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specific analyses show the frequent use of historical or landmark papers, which add authority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Papers expressing an opposing viewpoint are rarely cited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The citation network for this common and well-established practice provides an example of selective citation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pattern of citation tends to escalate belief in a clinical practice even when it lacks a high-quality evidence base and may create an impression of more authority than is warranted </plain></SENT>
