<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently published dietary guidelines for the intakes of carbohydrates, fiber, fats and water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated their role on the risk of a specific disease, known to be related to diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS/METHODS: We used data from an Italian case-control study including 1953 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cases and 4154 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We developed a so-called EFSA index summing up 1 point for adherence to each EFSA guideline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and its subsites were derived from unconditional multiple logistic regression models, for both the index and its components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When each EFSA index component was analyzed separately, we found significant increased risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for non adherence to the guidelines on linoleic (OR=1.20, 95% CI, 1.07-1.36) and alpha-linolenic fatty acids (OR=1.19, 95% CI, 1.06-1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the guidelines were included in the same model, no significant association emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with minimal adherence, the ORs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for subsequent EFSA index scores were 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72-1.47), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75-1.48), 1.04 (95% CI, 0.81-1.60), 0.99 (95% CI, 0.69-1.43), and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.67-1.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant association emerged for colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> separately, and for males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall adherence to the EFSA dietary guidelines is not associated to colorectal, colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> risk in our population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adherence to guidelines on linoleic and alpha-linolenic fatty acids may have a modest beneficial role on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
