<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to develop and evaluate the validity of a simple narrow-band imaging (NBI)-based classification system for differentiating hyperplastic from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in 4 phases: (1) evaluation of accuracy and reliability of histologic prediction by NBI-experienced colonoscopists; (2) development of a classification based on color, vessels, and surface pattern criteria, using a modified Delphi method; (3) validation of the component criteria by people not experienced in endoscopy or NBI analysis (25 medical students, 19 gastroenterology fellows) using 118 high-definition colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> images of known histology; and (4) validation of the classification system by NBI-trained gastroenterology fellows, using still images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a pilot evaluation during real-time colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We developed a classification system for the endoscopic diagnosis of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> histology and established its predictive validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 criteria were used, the specificity ranged from 94.9% to 100% and the combined sensitivity ranged from 8.5% to 61.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The specificities of the individual criteria were lower although the sensitivities were higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During real-time colonoscopy, endoscopists made diagnoses with high confidence for 75% of consecutive small colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, with 89% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and 95% negative predictive values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We developed and established the validity of an NBI classification system that can be used to diagnose colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In preliminary real-time evaluation, the system allowed endoscopic diagnoses of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> histology </plain></SENT>
