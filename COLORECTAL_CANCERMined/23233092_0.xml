<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference technology was used to establish stable LIMK1-miRNA/SW480 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of DADS and LIMK1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference on the migration and invasion of SW480 cells were observed by scratch wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of DADS on signaling molecules of the Rac1-Rho kinase (ROCK)1/p21-activated kinase (PAK)1-LIM kinase (LIMK)1-actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin pathway in SW480 cells were examined by RT-PCR and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The healing and migration rate of the SW480 cells was significantly reduced and the cell penetrating ability was significantly suppressed (P&lt;0.05) following treatment with DADS (45 mg/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis results showed that DADS significantly downregulated LIMK1 protein expression and suppressed LIMK1 protein phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the RT-PCR and western blot analysis results revealed that DADS suppressed Rac1, ROCK1, PAK1, LIMK1 and destrin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression, as well as the protein phosphorylation of LIMK1 and cofilin 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that LIMK1 expression positively correlates with the SW480 cell migration and invasion ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DADS downregulates the Rac1-ROCK1/PAK1-LIMK1-ADF/cofilin signaling pathway, suppressing SW480 cell migration and invasion </plain></SENT>
