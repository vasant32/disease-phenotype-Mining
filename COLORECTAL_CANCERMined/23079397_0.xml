<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These changes affect both noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and so define the clinical behaviour of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells within a distinctive host genetic and environmental context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment modalities have decreased mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, prognostic stratification and adjuvant therapy selection after surgery remain dependent on broad descriptive classifications, opportune histological markers of poor prognosis and chemotherapy efficacy data derived from diverse <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crucially, there is significant inter- and intra-individual variability in response to, and tolerance of, chemotherapy treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These limitations explain the small clinical benefit of new agents studied in contemporary phase III trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular assays have the potential to address these constraints and there has been intense interest in the identification of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These must be easy to obtain and quantify and ideally represent steps in well-understood carcinogenic pathways or host-response mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although some biomarkers can provide broad prognostic information based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtype (e.g. MSI status) or can somewhat predict response to targeted therapies (e.g. KRAS), no <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-based biomarkers have entered routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is due, in part, to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of both patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, serious underlying issues with regards to study design, poor technical protocols, inadequate quality controls and inappropriate data analysis prevent successful translation of research results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the identification of clinically relevant panels of biomarkers will depend not just on further advances in our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> biology, but will need to be coupled with appropriate study designs and more suitable, standardised and transparent techniques </plain></SENT>
