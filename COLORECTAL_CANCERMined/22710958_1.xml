<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> needs early identification of patients that are not responding to systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) performed before and early during treatment has been proposed for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the best way to assess the change in FDG uptake between two scans has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied cutoff thresholds to identify responding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> as a function of the method used to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 28 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients who underwent 2 FDG PET/CT scans (baseline and at day 14 of the first course of polychemotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 78 tumour lesions, 4 standardized uptake value (SUV) indices were measured: maximum SUV (SUV(max)) and mean SUV in a region obtained using an isocontour (SUV(40 %)), with each of these SUV normalized either by the patient body weight (BW) or body surface area (BSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The per cent change and absolute change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> uptake between the baseline and the early PET scans were measured based on these four indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were correlated to the RECIST 1.0-based response using contrast-enhanced CT at baseline and at 6-8 weeks on treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 78 tumours were classified as non-responding (NRL, n = 58) and responding lesions (RL, n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves characterizing the performance in NRL/RL classification using early FDG PET uptake had areas under the curve between 0.75 and 0.84, without significant difference between the indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cutoff threshold in FDG uptake per cent change to get a 95 % sensitivity of RL detection depended on the way uptake was measured: -14 % (specificity of 53 %) and -22 % (specificity of 64 %) for SUV(max) and SUV(40 %), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thresholds expressed as absolute SUV decrease instead of per cent change were less sensitive to the SUV definition: an SUV decline by 1.2 yielded a sensitivity of RL detection of 95 % for SUV(max) and SUV(40 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For a given cutoff threshold, the sensitivity was the same whatever the normalization (by BSA or BW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A 14 % drop of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> FDG SUV(max), 22 % drop of SUV(40 %) or 1.2 drop of SUV(max) or SUV(mean) after one single course of polychemotherapy predicts objective response in mCRC lesions with a high sensitivity, potentially allowing the early identification of non-responding patients </plain></SENT>
