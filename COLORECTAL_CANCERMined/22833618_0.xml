<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross sectional prevalence and diagnostic accuracy study with index test of faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and reference standard of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Outpatient clinics in metropolitan and regional hospitals in South Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 229 kidney transplant recipients aged 50 years and over, who were at least 6 months (mean 9.0 (SD 8.4) years) post-transplant and otherwise at average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, completed the study between June 2008 and October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Faecal immunochemical testing (Enterix Insure) for human <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, followed by colonoscopy with histological evaluation of retrieved samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, defined as an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at least 10 mm in diameter, villous features, high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> testing for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> compared with colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was found in 29 (13%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 18%) participants, including 2% (n=4) with high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 2% (n=5) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Faecal testing for <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> was positive in 12% (n=28); sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were 31.0% (15.3% to 50.8%), 90.5% (85.6% to 94.2%), 32.1% (15.9% to 52.4%), and 90.1% (85.1% to 93.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy was well tolerated, with no significant adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To identify one case of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, 8 (6 to 12) colonoscopies were needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients aged over 50 years have a high prevalence of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> screening for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> has similar performance characteristics in transplant recipients to those reported in general population studies, with poor sensitivity but reasonable specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy might be a more appropriate approach in this population </plain></SENT>
