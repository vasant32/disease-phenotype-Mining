<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim for this study was to investigate the correlation and clinical significance between the expression of IGF-II and Bcl-2 in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, especially in terms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty paraffin embedded samples of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> were selected, and fifteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected using in situ hybridization, and the expression of Bcl-2 along with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein was detected through immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TUNEL assay was used to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens with a positive cell ratio less than 30% were defined as negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and the Bcl-2 protein were significantly higher in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (39.64 ± 7.38% and 30.74 ± 7.22%, respectively) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal tissues (22.56 ± 4.21% and 12.17 ± 1.94%, respectively) (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels were related to Dukes' stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e>, but were unrelated to patient age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, a negative correlation was observed between IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Bcl-2 protein (P &lt; 0.05) during Dukes' stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a positive correlation between IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PCNA or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as well as a negative correlation between Bcl-2 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were observed (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Bcl-2 and PCNA (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients detected as IGF-II <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (+) and Bcl-2 (-) showed the worst prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of IGF-II and Bcl-2 was correlated with the clinical manifestation of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; thus, the assessment of both IGF-II and Bcl-2's status will provide important information regarding the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
