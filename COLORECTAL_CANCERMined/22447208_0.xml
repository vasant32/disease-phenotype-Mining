<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that colon <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is affected during the aging process: crypt loss (P=0.045) and increasing distances between crypts (P=0.0001678) were observed, associated with a tendency for mucosa reduction (P=0.083) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> plays a determining role on the effect of aging during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
