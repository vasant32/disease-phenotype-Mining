<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess Navajo adults' knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors and prevention, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and self-reported experience with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We collected data generated by a self-administered survey given to Navajo adults, most of whom lived on the reservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at 2 annual tribal fairs in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fair attendees who visited an exhibit booth completed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study design was nonrandomized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 285 Navajo adults who participated, most were bilingual (74%) and female (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the respondents aged 50 years or older, 77% had heard of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and 28% reported being screened for colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge was high (mean, 5.78 [standard deviation (SD), 1.28]) (8.0 was the highest possible knowledge score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respondents with little or no formal schooling had lower scores (mean, 5.4), indicating less knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and associated screening tests than did those with more education (mean, 6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among a sample of Navajo adults aged 50 years or older, participants with more education were more likely to be knowledgeable about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to have received screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This survey, led by a Navajo investigator with Navajo surveyors, revealed a high awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening, but overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> education for Navajo adults who have little or no formal schooling should be improved </plain></SENT>
