<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study between 2006 and 2008, a total of 7,541 average-risk Chinese persons aged 40 years or older who had complete colonoscopy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The derivation and validation cohorts consisted of 5,229 and 2,312 persons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prediction rule was developed from a logistic regression model and then internally and externally validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prediction rule comprised 8 variables (age, sex, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, green vegetables, pickled food, fried food, and white meat), with scores ranging from 0 to 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the participants with low-risk (â‰¤3) or high-risk (&gt;3) scores in the validation cohort, the risks of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were 2.6% and 10.0% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If colonoscopy was used only for persons with high risk, 80.3% of persons with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> would be detected while the number of colonoscopies would be reduced by 49.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prediction rule had good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.78) and calibration (P = 0.77) and, thus, provides accurate risk stratification for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in average-risk Chinese </plain></SENT>
