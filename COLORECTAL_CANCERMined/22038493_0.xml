<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is controversial whether division of the inferior mesenteric artery close to the aorta influences the risk of anastomotic leakage, especially in the elderly and unfit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This population-based study was carried out to evaluate the independent association between a high arterial ligation and anastomotic leakage in anterior resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had anterior resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> from 2007 to 2009 inclusive were identified in the Swedish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between high tie and anastomotic leakage was evaluated in a logistic regression model, with adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratification was performed for co-morbidity as judged by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic anastomotic leakage occurred in 81 (9·9 per cent) of 818 patients with a high tie and 108 (9·8 per cent) of 1101 without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the use of a high tie was not associated with a higher risk of anastomotic leakage (odds ratio (OR) 1·00, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·72 to 1·39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no increased risk in patients classifed as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade I or II (OR 0·97, 0·69 to 1·35), or in those graded <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> III or IV (OR 1·26, 0·58 to 2·75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the present population-based setting, use of a high tie was not associated with an increased rate of symptomatic anastomotic leakage </plain></SENT>
