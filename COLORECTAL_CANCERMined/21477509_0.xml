<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COMMUNITY CONTEXT: Ride for Life Alaska (RFL), a nonprofit organization that raises funds to fight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and the Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC), which is Alaska's largest community health center, joined efforts to provide <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening and outreach to an ethnically diverse group of low-income underinsured or uninsured patients residing in and around Anchorage, Alaska </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: RFL and ANHC worked with gastroenterologists, medical practices, and pathology services to contribute pro bono and reduced-fee services for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information to patients was distributed through signs in the clinic, flyers, and the ANHC website </plain></SENT>
