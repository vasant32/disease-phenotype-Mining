<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal alteration of telomere length has been linked to several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; however, epidemiologic evidence about the association of telomere length with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk has been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate the association between telomere length and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk using peripheral blood samples collected before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 441 women with incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 549 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR was applied to measure relative telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regressions were used to derive adjusted OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between telomere length and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A U-shaped association was observed between telomere length and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk (test for nonlinearity P = 0.0112) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women with telomere length in the third quintile (40th-60th percentiles) had the lowest risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the risks were elevated with a shorter or longer telomere length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This U-shaped association did not statistically differ for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectum cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPACT: Our prospective study revealed a U-shaped association between telomere length in peripheral blood cells and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide strong evidence that both very short and very long telomeres are associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
