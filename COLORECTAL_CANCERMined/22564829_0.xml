<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic colectomies produce advantages in short-term outcome compared to open procedures and have recently benefited by a long term oncologic validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to compare the short- and medium-term surgical outcomes of totally laparoscopic (TLRC) and laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy (LARC) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, hypothesizing they may be at least similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive unselected series of 72 patients undergone elective surgery for right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> from April 2006 to April 2011 was retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated by laparoscopic medial-to-lateral right colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 42 patients a TLRC was performed, in 30 a LARC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative care plan, operative steps and surgical instrumentations were standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the operations were performed or supervised by the same Surgeon (I.S.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data on the patients' demographics, disease features, operative details and follow up were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed with the Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Categorical ones were expressed as percent value and analyzed with Fischer test or Chi-square test, where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>P &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in term of age, sex, body mass index and American Society of Anesthesiology score between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Comorbidities, site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and stage of disease were similar too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No conversion to laparotomy was registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Median operative time (186.3 ± 40.1 min vs 176.5 ± 40.0 min; not significant (NS)) and estimated blood loss (43.3 ± 89.8 ml vs 31.2 ± 51.3 ml; NS) were statistically comparable in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Timing of first defecation (3.4 ± 0.9 dd vs 2.9 ± 0.9; P = 0.023) and length of hospital stay (7.2 ± 1.3 dd vs 6.2 ± 1.1 dd; P &lt; 0.001) were statistically lower in TLRC cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A significantly longer length of skin incision characterized LARC group compared with TLRC group (71.0 ± 13.5 mm vs 48.2 ± 10.2 mm; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Both groups achieved an adequate number of lymph nodes harvested (22.0 ± 8.2 vs 25.9 ± 9.0; P = 0.036) and oncological resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (proximal margin 7.6 ± 7.7 vs 6.1 ± 3.8; NS - distal margin 13.3 ± 7.7 vs 13.6 ± 5.8; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Post-operative complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification were statistically comparable in both cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>No readmission within 60 days of discharge was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up recorded was 27.7 ± 16.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Late complications consisted in 1 case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004872'>incisional hernia</z:hpo> (3.8%) in LARC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although more appropriate indications must be set by future studies, we encourage the choice of a TLRC for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>TLRC is actually a feasible and safe technique, which has resulted in an encouraging short-term outcome, low incidence of major complications and preservation of oncologic principles, without affecting operative times </plain></SENT>
