<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective screening for K-ras status will overarch rational personalized medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stool-based DNA testing offers unique advantages for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening such as noninvasiveness, high specificity, and patient compliance, whereas complicated procedures and the low sensitivity of the present approaches have hampered its application on a wide scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a chip-based temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis (TGCE) technique was applied to detect low-abundance K-ras mutations under a pooled experiment and analyze K-ras mutations in 30 paired stool samples and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 15 stool samples of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chip-based TGCE results showed that the successful analysis of K-ras status could be achieved within 6 min with an extremely low sample consumption of 14 nl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detection is sensitive enough to reliably report 0.2% mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> background, and 0.5 ng of template DNA was sufficient for chip-based TGCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 30 stool samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients analyzed, 17 (57%) harbored K-ras mutations, and the lowest percentage of the detectable mutant K-ras in stool samples was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coincidence rate for K-ras mutations between stools and tissues obtained by the chip-based method reached 97% (29/30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the 15 stool samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls carried K-ras mutations, producing a specificity of 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clone sequencing data entirely confirmed the results obtained by chip-based TGCE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that chip-based TGCE is capable of rapidly screening low-abundance K-ras mutations with high sensitivity, reproducibility, simplicity, and significant savings of time and sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Application of this method to genotype the K-ras gene in stools would provide a potential means for predicting the effectiveness of EGFR-targeted therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients using noninvasive approaches </plain></SENT>
