<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Empirical evidence for recommendations of surveillance intervals after detection and removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at colonoscopy is still sparse and mostly based on observations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) according to time since polypectomy and factors that might be relevant for risk stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a population-based case-control study conducted in Germany, detailed history and results of previous large-bowel endoscopies were obtained by interview and from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among participants with detection of at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> at a preceding colonoscopy compared with participants without previous large-bowel endoscopy was assessed according to time since polypectomy among 2,582 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 1,798 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for participants with polypectomy less than 3, 3 to 5, and 6 to 10 years ago (using participants without previous endoscopy as reference group) were 0.2 (0.2 to 0.3), 0.4 (0.3 to 0.6), and 0.9 (0.5 to 1.5), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong, significant risk reduction within 5 years was consistently seen for women and men, younger and older participants, patients with and without high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (three or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> â‰¥ 1 cm, at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> with villous components), and those with and without polypectomy in the right colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With adjusted odds ratios of 0.1 (0.1 to 0.2), 0.3 (0.2 to 0.5) and 0.4 (0.2 to 0.8) for patients with polypectomy less than 3, 3 to 5, and 6 to 10 years ago, risk reduction was particularly strong for left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extension of surveillance intervals to 5 years should be considered, even after detection and removal of high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
