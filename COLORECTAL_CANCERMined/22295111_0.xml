<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence suggests that the presence of inflammatory cells plays a critical role in the development and/or progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils are the common inflammatory cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>; however, the infiltration of intratumoral neutrophils in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and its effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients' prognosis are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, the methods of tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff score for high intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was defined when the mean counts were more than 60 per <z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> spot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our study, high intratumoral CD66b+ neutrophil was observed in 104/229 (45.4%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> and in 29/229 (12.7%) of adjacent mucosal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further correlation analysis showed that high intratumoral neutrophil was positively correlated with pT status, pM status and clinical stage (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate survival analysis, a significant association between high intratumoral neutrophil and shortened patients' survival was found (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In different subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, intratumoral neutrophil was also a prognostic indicator in patients with stage II, stage III, grade 2, grade 3, pT1, pT2, pN0 and pN1 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, high intratumoral neutrophil was evaluated as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide evidence that increased intratumoral neutrophil in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> may be important in the acquisition of a malignant phenotype, indicating that the presence of intratumoral neutrophil is an independent factor for poor prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
