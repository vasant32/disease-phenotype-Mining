<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also analyse the functional recovery of the FT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective cohort study with non-concurrent control, was conducted on a group of 108 patients operated on for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 2008 and 2009, to which the FT protocol was applied, and a control group (CG) of 147 patients subjected to surgery between 2005 and 2007 with similar characteristics, with traditional postoperative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The demographic characteristics, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> risk, and the surgical procedures performed were similar, with a higher number of patients with laparoscopic approach in the FT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compliance with the items in our FT protocol was high (72.2-92.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications were observed in 77 patients (52%) in the GC compared to 30 (27.8%) in the FT group (P&lt;.001), mainly due to the decrease in surgical wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality and the number of readmissions were less in the FT group, with no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median hospital stay was 14 days in the CG and 8 in the FT group (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The applying of an FT program in colorectal surgery is safe, leading to a significant decrease in morbidity and hospital stay, without increasing the number of readmissions </plain></SENT>
