<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SW480 cells were divided into control group (0 Gy) and study groups (2, 4, 6, 8 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells in the study groups were irradiated by 6-MV X-ray radiation for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR methods were used to investigate the influence of radiation on Kiss-1 gene expression of SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colony formation assay was used to detect the proliferation of SW480 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry-Annexin- V/PI assay was used to observe the change of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the control group, Kiss-1 protein expression increased after radiation of 6, 8 Gy (P&lt;0.05), but no significant changes were observed after radiation of 2, 4 Gy(P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kiss-1 gene <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level increased after radiation of 2, 4, 6 Gy, while no obvious change was observed for 8 Gy radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates increased for 4, 6, 8 Gy radiation(P&lt;0.05), however, there was no significant difference for 2 Gy radiation (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Radiation may increase Kiss-1 gene expression in SW480 cells, which results in decreases proliferation and increases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in residual surviving cells </plain></SENT>
