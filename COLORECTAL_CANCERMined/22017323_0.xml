<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, there is only one report of identification of MDF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; however, the histological characteristics of human MDF are not discussed extensively in the report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, colonic samples from 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were stained with Alcian blue and examined for the presence of MDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the samples were examined for the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="6872">methylene blue</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified MDF into two categories: flat-MDF and protruded-MDF (having the characteristics of both ACF and MDF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a total of 354, 41 and 19 colonic mucosal lesions with a mean multiplicity of 44, 38.9 and 66.9 crypts (ACF, flat-MDF and protruded-MDF, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The density of MDF was 0.0082 lesions/cm(2)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ACF identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients corresponded to hyperplastic or non-dysplasic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, MDF identified in these patients corresponded to low-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that Paneth cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> and inflammatory cell infiltration were specific histological features of MDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These histological characteristics are reported to be associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results indicate that MDF might represent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_481'>preneoplastic lesions</z:mpath> in human colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
