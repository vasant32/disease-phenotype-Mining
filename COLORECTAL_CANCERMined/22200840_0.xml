<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the characteristics and predictors of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> after negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Southern Germany in 2003-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics were compared among 78 patients with interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occurring 1-10 years after a negative colonoscopy and 433 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected at screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the indication for the preceding negative colonoscopy and its completeness were compared between patients with interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and 515 controls with a preceding negative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 56.4% of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> occurred among women compared with 33.7% of cases detected by screening (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for covariates, female sex (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.83) and location in the caecum or ascending colon (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.35) were independently associated with occurrence of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The preceding negative colonoscopy was more commonly conducted because of a positive faecal occult blood test (26.0% vs 12.9%, p=0.009) and was more often incomplete (caecum not reached: 18.1% vs 6.7%, p=0.001) among interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases than among controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the preceding negative colonoscopy strongly and independently associated with occurrence of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were follow-up of a positive faecal occult blood test among men (OR 5.49, 95% CI 2.10 to 14.35) and incompleteness among women (OR 4.38, 95% CI 1.69 to 11.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed patterns suggest that a substantial proportion of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> missed at colonoscopy and are potentially preventable by enhanced performance of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
