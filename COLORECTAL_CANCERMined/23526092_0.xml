<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is increasing rapidly in Asian countries during the past few decades, but no comprehensive analysis has been done to find out the exact cause of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the frequencies of mutations and expression pattern of K-ras, APC (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001436" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adenomatosis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis coli</z:e>) and p53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, adjoining and distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and to correlate these alterations with patients clinicopathological parameters as well as with the survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction digestion was used to detect mutations in K-ras and PCR-SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism) followed by DNA sequencing was used to detect mutations in APC and p53 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression pattern of K-ras, APC and p53 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of mutations of K-ras, APC and p53 in 30 tumor tissues samples were 26.7 %, 46.7 % and 20 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 3.3 % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> contained mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common combination of mutation was APC and p53 whereas mutation in both p53 and K-ras were extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the mutations and expression pattern of K-ras, APC and p53 (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Indians, the frequency of alterations of K-ras and APC is similar as in Westerns, whereas the frequency of p53 mutation is slightly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lack of multiple mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens suggests that these genetic alterations might have independent influences on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and there could be multiple alternative genetic pathways to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in our present study cohort </plain></SENT>
