<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focus groups were conducted with 23 African American patients between 50 and 70 years of age who were patients in a general internal medicine clinic in a large urban teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focus groups were delimited by gender and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focus group transcripts were analyzed using an iterative coding process with consensus and triangulation to develop thematic categories </plain></SENT>
