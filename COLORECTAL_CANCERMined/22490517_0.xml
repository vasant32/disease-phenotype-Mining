<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has a substantial heritable component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Common genetic variation has been shown to contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A study was conducted in a large multi-population study to assess the feasibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk prediction using common genetic variant data combined with other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A risk prediction model was built and applied to the Scottish population using available data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nine populations of European descent were studied to develop and validate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk prediction models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression was used to assess the combined effect of age, gender, family history (FH) and genotypes at 10 susceptibility loci that individually only modestly influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk models were generated from case-control data incorporating genotypes alone (n=39 266) and in combination with gender, age and FH (n=11 324) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Model discriminatory performance was assessed using 10-fold internal cross-validation and externally using 4187 independent samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 10-year absolute risk was estimated by modelling genotype and FH with age- and gender-specific population risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of risk alleles was greater in cases than controls (10 vs 9, p&lt;2.2×10(-16)), confirmed in external validation sets (Sweden p=1.2×10(-6), Finland p=2×10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean per-allele increase in risk was 9% (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Discriminative performance was poor across the risk spectrum (area under curve for genotypes alone 0.57; area under curve for genotype/age/gender/FH 0.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, modelling genotype data, FH, age and gender with Scottish population data shows the practicalities of identifying a subgroup with &gt;5% predicted 10-year absolute risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Genotype data provide additional information that complements age, gender and FH as risk factors, but individualised genetic risk prediction is not currently feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the modelling exercise suggests public health potential since it is possible to stratify the population into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk categories, thereby informing targeted prevention and surveillance </plain></SENT>
