<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Data came from personal interviews with a prospective cohort of patients with breast (n=141) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (n=224) with incident disease drawn from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (1998-2006) with linked Medicare claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: The 27-point modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status was used to assess cognitive functioning, focusing on memory and attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We defined the smallest clinically significant change as 0.4 points per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We used Bayesian hierarchical linear models to test the hypotheses, adjusting for multiple possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight patients were treated with chemotherapy; 277 were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 75.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for a median of 3.1 years after diagnosis, with a range of 0 to 8.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no differences in the rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> before and after diagnosis for patients who received chemotherapy in adjusted models (P=0.86, one-sided 95% posterior intervals lower bound: 0.09 worse after chemotherapy), where patients served as their own controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> after diagnosis did not differ between patients who had chemotherapy and those who did not (P=0.84, one-sided 95% posterior intervals lower bound: 0.11 worse for chemotherapy group in adjusted model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> associated with chemotherapy in this sample of older adults with breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
