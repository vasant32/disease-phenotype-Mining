<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> are mostly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mucinous and signet-ring cell subtypes occur with a very low incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these subtypes differ remarkably in terms of clinical, histological and molecular biological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this review is to present a detailed analysis of current knowledge regarding differences between classical <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous, and signet-ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> along with potential consequences for daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods: For this report <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> articles with relevant information on differences between classical <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous, and signet-ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> found via Pubmed searches were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, findings of our previous study were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results: Mucinous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occur with a reported incidence of 10 - 20 % in Western countries and are predominantly found in younger patients and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are more often diagnosed in the proximal colon and present with a higher stage at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a higher rate of lymph node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of molecular biological studies confirm that they may represent a different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The response to well established chemotherapy regimens is poorer which may be attributed to the higher rate of microsatellite-instable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> and an increased mucin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The poorer outcome is likely related to the higher stage at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Signet-ring cell type <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are rare with an incidence ranging between 0,9 % to 4 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>They are also more common in the right colon and are associated with a poorer outcome compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and mucinous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: However, it should be noted that most of the results come from studies with a very low number of patients which can be attributed to the low incidence of mucinous and signet-ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings of the present analysis, a more radical surgical approach should be considered providing that the exact preoperative histology is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the histological subtype should be taken into account in future chemotherapy trials to avoid unnecessary therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A closer follow-up, especially for patients with signet-ring cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> should be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the near future, a more tailored therapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> would be highly desirable </plain></SENT>
