<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several polymorphic variants within the ABCB1 gene have been reported as modulators of ABCB1-mediated transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the impact of ABCB1 genetic variants on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A hybrid tagging/functional approach was performed to select 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped in 1,321 Czech subjects, 699 CRC cases and 622 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, six potentially functional SNPs were genotyped in 3,662 German subjects, 1,809 cases and 1,853 controls from the DACHS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that three functional SNPs (rs1202168, rs1045642 and rs868755) were associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the German population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the rs1202168_T and rs868755_T alleles had an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P(trend) = 0.016 and 0.029, respectively), while individuals bearing the rs1045642_C allele showed a decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P(trend) = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We sought to replicate the most significant results in an independent case-control study of 3,803 subjects, 2,169 cases and 1,634 controls carried out in the North of Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the SNPs tested were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the replication study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this study of about 8,800 individuals we show that ABCB1 gene polymorphisms play at best a minor role in the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
