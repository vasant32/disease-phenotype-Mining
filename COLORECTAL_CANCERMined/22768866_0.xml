<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the differences of twenty lymphocyte subsets between colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients and healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets from 168 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients and 102 healthy individuals were examined by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The differences of these lymphocyte subsets between healthy individuals and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients at different clinical stages were analyzed statistically with SPSS 17.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with healthy people, the percentages of CD29(+), 45RA(+), CD4(+) CD45RO(+) and CD8(+) CD28(-) cells in peripheral blood of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients increased significantly (P&lt;0.05), while the percentages of NKT, 45RO(+), CD4(+) CD45RA(+), CD28(+) and CD8(+) CD28(+) cells decreased significantly (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD8(+) CD28(-) cells in IV stage patients was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals, I+II and III stage patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cellular immunity of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients is attenuated, while the humoral immunity is strengthened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The traditional lymphocyte analysis using CD3(+), CD4(+), NK or CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio can not precisely evaluate the immunological function of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of multi-lymphocyte subsets including CD8(+) CD28(+) and CD8(+) CD28(-) cells, is likely a better way to evaluate the immunological status of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
