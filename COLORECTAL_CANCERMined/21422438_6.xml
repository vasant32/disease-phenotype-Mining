<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively measured plasma 25(OH)D levels in 515 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> participating in a randomized trial of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>Vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> was defined as 25(OH)D lower than 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20 to 29 ng/mL, and sufficiency as â‰¥ 30 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between baseline 25(OH)D level and selected patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, disease progression, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response, adjusted for prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 515 eligible patients, 50% of the study population was <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> deficient, and 82% were <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma 25(OH)D levels were lower in black patients compared to white patients and patients of other race (median, 10.7 v 21.1 v 19.3 ng/mL, respectively; P &lt; .001), and females compared to males (median, 18.3 v 21.7 ng/mL, respectively; P = .0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline plasma 25(OH)D levels were not associated with patient outcome, although given the distribution of plasma levels in this cohort, statistical power for survival analyses were limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>Vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> is highly prevalent among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677950" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage IV colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving first-line chemotherapy, particularly in black and female patients </plain></SENT>
