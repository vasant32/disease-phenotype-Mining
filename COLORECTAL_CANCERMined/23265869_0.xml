<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed 76,208 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 45,592 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study for up to 24 years and examined garlic intake and garlic supplement use in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on garlic intake and supplement use was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and a Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the multivariable hazard ratio (MV-HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 2368 (1339 women and 1029 men) incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and fo und no association between garlic intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk; the MV-HRs (95% CIs) associated with garlic (1 clove or 4 shakes per serving) intake â‰¥ 1/day compared with &lt; 1/month were 1.21 (0.94-1.57; p-trend = 0.14) for women and 1.00 (0.71-1.42; p-trend = 0.89) for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MV-HRs (95% CIs) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for garlic supplement use, which was used in 6% of the participants in each study, were 0.72 (0.48-1.07) for women and 1.22 (0.83-1.78) for men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our prospective data do not support an important role of garlic intake or garlic supplement use in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
