<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants (30 female, 20 male; 50-71 years) recruited through urban (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch) GP surgeries for in-depth, face-to-face interviews (digitally recorded and professionally transcribed verbatim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A pragmatic approach focused on aggregating transcript content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Participants believed early <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lacked distinguishing signs and symptoms, but was treatable and suitable for screening, although slow development may undermine any sense of urgency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FOBT inaccuracies caused concern, particularly false negatives, but ongoing testing could reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimen collection was awkward, challenged social norms and individual squeamishness, but provided peace of mind, was painless, simple and private without high cost technological or professional involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lacking preventive attitudes and experience of health responsibilities and screening, men were less likely to participate than women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lacked public profile, highlighting government responsibility, before programme implementation, to resource high-profile education, largely through TV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General practitioner support and promotion was seen as critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inadequate health system capacity and resourcing was problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenging barriers, participants identified opportunities to increase FOBT screening participation, especially promotion to raise <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> profile, overcome perceived normative barriers and build self-efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adequate resourcing is essential to support appropriate promotion and timely programme delivery </plain></SENT>
