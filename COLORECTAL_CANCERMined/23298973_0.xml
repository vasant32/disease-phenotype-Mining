<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and different nutritional assessment methods was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective, and descriptive study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nutritional status was defined by the SGA and the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was defined by the Glasgow Prognostic Score (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complications were classified using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements such as body mass index, triceps skinfold, midarm circumference, midarm muscle area, and adductor pollicis muscle thickness were also performed, as were handgrip strength and phase angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The chi-square test, Fisher exact test, Spearman correlation coefficient, independent t test, analysis of variance, Gabriel test, and κ index were used for the statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (60.4 ± 14.3 y old) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nutritional status according to the SGA was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), but the SGA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> were not related to the presence of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When comparing the different nutritional assessment methods with the SGA, there were statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>Malnutrition</z:hpo> is highly prevalent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The nutritional status was associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GPS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
