<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To estimate the summary association between red meat intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and to examine sources of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, a meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four prospective studies of red meat and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified, of which 25 represented independent nonoverlapping study populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) for high versus low intake and dose-response relationships were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the high versus low intake meta-analysis, the SRRE was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.04-1.21) with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary associations were modified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SRREs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> were 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03-1.19) and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.97-1.46), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SRREs among men and women were 1.21 (95% CI: 1.04-1.42) and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.87-1.17), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The available epidemiologic data are not sufficient to support an independent and unequivocal positive association between red meat intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is based on summary associations that are weak in magnitude, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> across studies, inconsistent patterns of associations across the subgroup analyses, and the likely influence of confounding by other dietary and lifestyle factors </plain></SENT>
