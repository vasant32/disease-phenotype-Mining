<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, it was aimed to search for a reliable approach in the quantification of angio- and lymphangiovascular density and area as a prognostic factor and to compare such vessel counts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was performed on 60 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 30 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and 10 colorectal non-neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Archival tissues were submitted to immunohistochemical evaluation using antibodies to CD31, CD34, CD105, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and D2-40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microvessel density and total vascular area were determined by computer image analysis and values were compared in the three groups of lesions; the prognostic value of these parameters was evaluated in the group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most markers showed progressive vessel counts from non-neoplastic tissue to <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, both for microvessel density and total vascular area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only microvessel density determined by CD34 in the central areas of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> correlated with recurrence/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.04) and survival (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different methods of quantification (microvessel counting versus estimation of total vascular area), immunohistochemical markers (pan-endothelial marker versus neovessels and lymphatic markers), and areas of analysis (periphery versus inner portions of the lesion) were assessed using image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results corroborate the increase in vascularization of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and suggest that microvessel density determined by immunostaining for CD34 in the inner portion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> might represent a prognostically relevant parameter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
