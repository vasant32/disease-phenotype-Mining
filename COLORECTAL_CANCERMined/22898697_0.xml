<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DWI (high b-value of 1000 s/mm(2)) was prospectively performed in 26 symptomatic patients who were scheduled to undergo colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DWI and colonoscopic findings were interpreted in a blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of DWI for the detection of clinically relevant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (≥6 mm) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were calculated on a per-lesion basis, using colonoscopy results as the standard of reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and negative predictive value (NPV) on a per-patient basis were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> on a per-lesion basis were 80.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 49.0%-94.3%] and 72.7% (95% CI: 43.4%-90.3%) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥6 mm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and NPV on a per-patient basis were 85.7% (95% CI: 48.7%-97.4%), 84.2% (95% CI: 62.4%-94.5%), 66.7% (95% CI: 35.4%-87.9%) and 94.1% (95% CI: 73.0%-99.0%) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> ≥6mm and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DWI cannot yet be recommended in a clinical setting in which DWI is performed first and subsequent colonoscopy is only performed in patients with positive findings at DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further (technical) developments are required to increase its diagnostic yield </plain></SENT>
