<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reduced representation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing (RRBS) was developed to measure DNA methylation of high-CG regions at single base-pair resolution, and has been widely used because of its minimal DNA requirements and cost efficacy; however, the CpG coverage of genomic regions is restricted and important regions with low-CG will be ignored in DNA methylation profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method could be improved to generate a more comprehensive representation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on in silico simulation of enzyme digestion of human and mouse genomes, we have optimized the current single-enzyme RRBS by applying double enzyme digestion in the library construction to interrogate more representative regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CpG coverage of genomic regions was considerably increased in both high-CG and low-CG regions using the double-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels and identification of differential methylation regions between samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also applied this double-enzyme RRBS method to comprehensively analyze the CpG methylation profiles of two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The double-enzyme RRBS increases the CpG coverage of genomic regions considerably over the previous single-enzyme RRBS method, leading to more accurate detection of their average methylation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It will facilitate genome-wide DNA methylation studies in multiple and complex clinical samples </plain></SENT>
