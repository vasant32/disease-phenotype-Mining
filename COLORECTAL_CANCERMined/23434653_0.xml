<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms are not completely understood, especially in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> model was used first to examine the anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> effect of CK in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, multiple in vitro assays were applied to investigate the anticancer effects of CK including antiproliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell cycle distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a qPCR array and western blot analysis were executed to screen and validate the molecules and pathways involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that CK significantly inhibited the growth of HCT-116 tumors in an athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CK significantly inhibited the proliferation of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines HCT-116, SW-480, and HT-29 in a dose- and time-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also observed that CK induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase in HCT-116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The processes were related to the upregulation of p53/p21, FoxO3a-p27/p15 and Smad3, and downregulation of cdc25A, CDK4/6 and cyclin D1/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major regulated targets of CK were cyclin dependent inhibitors, including p21, p27, and p15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CK inhibits transcriptional activation of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-promoting pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, suggesting that CK could be an active compound in the prevention or treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
