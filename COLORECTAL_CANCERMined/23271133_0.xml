<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence differs widely among different geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to mutational changes, epigenetic mechanisms also play important roles in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (O (6) -MGMT) is a DNA repair protein and in the absence of MGMT activity, G-to-A transition may accumulate in the specific genes such as K-ras and p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify which CpG sites are critical for its downregulation, we analyzed the methylation status of the MGMT gene promoter in two sites in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Then we compared the frequency of their methylation changes with the results of our previously reported K-ras gene mutation, APC2 and p16 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MGMT methylation was examined in 92 tumor samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A methylation specific PCR (MSP) method was performed for two loci of MGMT gene which described as MGMT-A and MGMT-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MGMT-A, and MGMT-B methylation was 49/91 (53.8 %), and 83/92 (90.2 %), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We detected high frequency of MGMT-B but not MGMT-A methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues with APC2 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that MGMT-B methylation is significantly associated with K-ras gene mutation rather than MGMT-A (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, an inverse correlation was found between p16 and MGMT-B methylation simultaneously (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that hypermethylation of the specific locus near the MGMT start codon is critical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MGMT-B assessment that is associated with K-ras mutation can have a prognostic value in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
