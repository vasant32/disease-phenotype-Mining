<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the performance of a TaqMelt polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay-the cobas® KRAS Mutation Test-designed to detect 19 mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The limit of detection was determined using DNA blends from cell lines, plasmids, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assay performance was compared to Sanger sequencing using a panel of 188 specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discordant specimens were subjected to next generation pyrosequencing (454) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assay repeatability was assessed using a panel of six specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A &gt;95% correct mutation call rate was obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimen types with ~5% mutant alleles at DNA inputs of 0.8-6.3 ng per PCR reaction; 100% detection rate was observed at the recommended DNA input of 50 ng </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive percent agreement with Sanger was 97.5% (79/81) for codons 12/13 and 85.7% (6/7) for codon 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Negative percent agreement was 94.4% (101/107) for codon 12/13 and 99.4% (180/181) for codon 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 discordant specimens yielded 454 results consistent with the cobas® results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With repeated testing, the assay showed a correct call rate of 100% (192/192) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operators, instruments, reagent lots, and days tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cobas® test detects KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 at a limit of detection of &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PCR assay was more sensitive and specific than Sanger sequencing, and performance was highly reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Test performance was not influenced by various endogenous interfering substances or common gut microbes </plain></SENT>
