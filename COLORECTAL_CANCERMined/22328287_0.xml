<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We randomly assigned 287 Stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients after curative resection between 2002 and 2008 to receive 2 cycles of HAIC plus 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy (combined therapy) or 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy alone (monotherapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the HAIC and systemic chemotherapy regimen consisted of a 2-hour infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">Oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (85mg/m2) on day 1 followed by folinic acid 200mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on days 2 and 3 and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> 2400mg/m2 as a 48-hour infusion on days 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment repeated every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival, overall survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>-free survival were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in adverse effects between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were found in 3-year disease-free survival (Combined therapy, 75.00%; Monotherapy, 63.27%; p=0.0035), overall survival (Combined therapy, 84.29%; Monotherapy, 65.31%; p=0.0006) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>-free survival (Combined therapy, 80.00%; Monotherapy, 69.39%; p=0.0451) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HAIC effectively and safely prevents metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and improves the prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Stage III colorectal cancer</z:e> after curative resection </plain></SENT>
