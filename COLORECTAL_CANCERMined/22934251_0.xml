<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the immune system in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has been elucidated in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While quantification of immune cell infiltrates within the resected specimen at diagnosis has a clear power to estimate the prognosis of the patient, the role of infiltrating immune cells within the metastatic situation and especially within the metastatic lesion itself requires further detailed analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent analyses of infiltrates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> revealed a role for the infiltrate density not only for prognosis but also in the prediction of treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This not only broadens the view on these infiltrates and indicates a systematic role of the local immunological microenvironment, but also raises the question how these infiltrates change during repeated courses of treatment (i.e., resection, chemotherapy, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this question, sequential lung or sequential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients were analyzed using whole slide image quantification after immunohistochemical staining against CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD68 and Granzyme B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical data and interventions were associated with each individual patient and the metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting cell densities reveal a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> profile: after successful treatment of a metastatic lesion, the recurrent lesion can still have the same immunophenotype with similar cell distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a situation of a favorable immune cell profile, this profile can return and apparently convey a similar favorable course throughout the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But also the opposite was found: the recurrent metastatic lesion could have a different profile with alterations in specific immune cell subsets over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analyses are required to elucidate the different patterns and their associations to the treatment, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> and other dynamic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it is clear from this data however, that there is an immune cell plasticity that needs to be analyzed for individual patients </plain></SENT>
