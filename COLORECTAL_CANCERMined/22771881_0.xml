<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic yields of a radiologist and trained technologists in the detection of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> within a population-based computed tomographic (CT) colonography screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical approval was obtained from the Dutch Health Council, and written informed consent was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine hundred eighty-two participants (507 men, 475 women) underwent low-dose CT colonography after noncathartic bowel preparation (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> tagging) between July 13, 2009, and January 21, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each scan was evaluated by one of three experienced radiologists (≥800 examinations) by using primary two-dimensional (2D) reading followed by secondary computer-aided detection (CAD) and by two of four trained technologists (≥200 examinations, with colonoscopic verification) by using primary 2D reading followed by three-dimensional analysis and CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate colonoscopy was recommended for participants with lesions measuring at least 10 mm, and surveillance was recommended for participants with lesions measuring 6-9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consensus between technologists was achieved in case of discordant recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (classified by a pathologist) was defined as a true-positive (TP) finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative TP and false-positive (FP) fractions were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 96 of the 982 participants were referred for colonoscopy and 104 were scheduled for surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty of 84 participants (71%) referred for colonoscopy by the radiologist had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, compared with 55 of 64 participants (86%) referred by two technologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both the radiologist and technologists detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relative TP fraction (for technologists vs radiologist) for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.07), and the relative FP fraction was 0.38 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Two technologists serving as a primary reader of CT colonographic images can achieve a comparable sensitivity to that of a radiologist for the detection of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, with far fewer FP referrals for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
