<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and five patients with postoperation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly divided into an acupuncture and moxibustion group, a Chinese medicine group and a routine treatment group, 35 cases in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated with gastrointestinal decompression and fluid replacement after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The acupuncture and moxibustion group was also treated with warming needle moxibustion on the 1st day after operation, and Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37) and Xiajuxu (ST 39) etc. were selected, once a day for 10 days, and the Chinese medicine group with Simo Decoction oral solution, three times daily for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal function, peripheral blood components and changes of T lymphocyte and NK cells in postoperative patients were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time of the first bowel sound, exhaust and defecation in the acupuncture and moxibustion group were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> shorter than those in the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day after operation, the percentages distribution of lymphocyte and neutrophil in the acupuncture and moxibustion group were better than those in the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The acupuncture and moxibustion group was also superior to the Chinese medicine group and the routine treatment group in improving the subgroup of T lymphocyte, NK cells and the digestive system symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Warming needle moxibustion has a good therapeutic effect on gastrointestinal function and can regulate bidirectionally peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophile granulocyte and improve the T lymphocyte subgroup and NK cells so as to promote the recovery of immune function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after operation </plain></SENT>
