<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We follow up our earlier experience with the use of InLine Multichannel Radiofrequency Device (ILMRD, Resect Medical Inc., Fremont, CA) a device that produces coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> along the transection plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 68 consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for primary and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumors</z:e> from August 2000 to December 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data analyzed include demographic data as well as complexity of liver resection, intra-operative blood loss, use of portal triad clamping and transfusion of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative outcomes measured were morbidity, hospital and ICU length of stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median estimated blood loss was 150 mL in the ILMRD group compared to 400 mL in the non-ILMRD group (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median length of stay was decreased in the ILMRD group by a day (7 vs. 8 p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in frequency of parenchymal clamp time (57% vs 84%, p &lt; 0.001) and median total portal triad clamp time (2.5 vs 30 min p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also noted a significant decrease in the median portal triad clamp time (0 vs 25 min, p &lt; 0.001) used during the parenchymal transection phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, use of the ILMRD device allowed us to perform more complex hepatic resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of ILMRD to perform radiofrequency-assisted hepatic resection was associated with a significant decrease in intra-operative blood loss and earlier discharge from the hospital despite increasing complexity of resections and decreased use of portal triad clamping </plain></SENT>
