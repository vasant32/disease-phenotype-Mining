<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main objective was to examine gender-specific associations of T2DM with CN in a population-based cohort study of adults in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis is based on participants of the ESTHER-study, a population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Participants were 50-74 years old at baseline and underwent colonoscopy during 5 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CN detected at colonoscopy were validated by medical records review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total and gender-specific associations of T2DM at baseline and CN were estimated using log-binomial regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 55 cases of CN were detected in 166 participants with T2DM and 328 cases in 1,360 participants without T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In women, CN was found in 32 % of participants with T2DM and in 18 % without T2DM (adjusted prevalence ratio (PR): 1.66 95 % CI 1.04-2.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men, prevalence for CN was 35 % for those with T2DM and 33 % for those without T2DM (adjusted PR = 1.01; 95 % CI 0.71-1.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T2DM might have a stronger impact on CN among women than among men </plain></SENT>
