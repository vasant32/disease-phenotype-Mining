<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a new post-translational modification at position -1 of the PDZ-binding motif in the mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (MCC) protein and its role in lamellipodia formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serine 828 at position -1 of this motif is phosphorylated, which is predicted to increase MCC binding affinity with the polarity protein Scrib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show that endogenous MCC localizes at the active migratory edge of cells, where it interacts with Scrib and the non-muscle motor protein Myosin-IIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of MCC harboring a phosphomimetic mutation MCC-S828D strongly impaired lamellipodia formation and resulted in accumulation of Myosin-IIB in the membrane cortex fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that MCC regulates lamellipodia formation by binding to Scrib and its downstream partner Myosin-IIB in a multiprotein complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we propose that the function of this complex is under the regulation of a newly described phosphorylation of the PDZ-binding motif at position -1 </plain></SENT>
