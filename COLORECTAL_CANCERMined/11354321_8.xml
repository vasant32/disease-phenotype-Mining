<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital, Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: 614 patients operated on for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between preoperative blood transfusion and preoperative concentration of sVEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association between perioperative blood transfusion and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood transfused up to one month before preoperative serum samples were obtained was significantly (p = 0.02) associated with high preoperative concentrations of sVEGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of perioperative blood transfusion was significantly (p = 0.0007) higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative or postoperative blood transfusion or both, were significantly (p = 0.03) associated with poor survival in patients with Dukes stage A, B and C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>, while this association was not found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative blood transfusion may be associated with high preoperative concentrations of sVEGF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transfusion during or after the operation is associated with poor survival in patients with Dukes stage A, B, and C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
