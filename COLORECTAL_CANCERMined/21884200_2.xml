<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">Oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta, ER-β, putatively plays a pathobiological role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> as colorectal epithelial cells frequently express ER-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to elucidate the association of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> (CA) repeat polymorphism of the ER-β gene (ESR2) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS:  <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">Deoxyribonucleic acids</z:chebi> extracted from the renal cortex of 1488 Japanese autopsies with complete clinical/pathological data were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CA repeat polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-labelled primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three genotype groups according to the number of CA repeats of each allele (S &lt; 22, L ≥ 22); SS (with two S alleles), SL (with one each S and L allele) and LL (with two L alleles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence/absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> was determined by examining the clinical records and autopsy material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was significantly different according to the ESR2 CA repeat genotype only among females (SS, 37/202 = 18.3%; SL, 19/332 = 5.7%; LL, 5/155 = 3.2%, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in females with the SS genotype, but not the SL genotype, frequently expressed the C-terminus portion of ER-β1 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ER-β) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A role for ESR2 CA repeat polymorphism in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among females is suggested </plain></SENT>
