<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is considered an independent risk factor for advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expected outcome for screening colonoscopy in patients with a family history is not well established in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a large, prospective study of an unselected population in San Diego, California to assess the impact of a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on the prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> on screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We evaluated 6,905 consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between January 2005 and December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 4,967 who met the inclusion criteria, the mean age was 58.8 and consisted of 58.6% women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 930 (18.7%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and 249 (5%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, eight (0.16%) of which were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 4,967 patients were divided into 643 with and 4,324 without a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 643 patients with a family history, 38 (5.9%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, one of which was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 4,324 patients without a family history, 211 (4.9%) had advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> including seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for finding advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with a single affected first degree relative was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.87-1.69; P = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A family history of one first-degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> did not predict a significantly higher prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at screening colonoscopy in this Southwestern cohort </plain></SENT>
