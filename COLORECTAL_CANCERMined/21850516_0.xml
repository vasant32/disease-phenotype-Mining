<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether affective context moderates the degree to which message frame is associated with behavioral intentions to engage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, we buttressed a framing manipulation with an "affective booster" to increase anticipated and anticipatory emotions associated with the framed messages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous research, we found that loss-framed messages are more effective in increasing intentions to screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, we found that among individuals who received gain-framed messages (but not loss-framed messages), the affective booster increased message persuasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect on intentions was partially mediated by self-efficacy for engaging in screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that in the presence of emotional boosters, loss-framed messages may lose their advantage over gain-framed messages in motivating detection behaviors, and that self-efficacy may partially explain these effects </plain></SENT>
