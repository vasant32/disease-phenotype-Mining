<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To quantify the myofibroblasts in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stroma of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> using immunostaining with anti smooth muscle actin (SMA) as a marker for myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out on 46 surgically resected primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> from the archive of the Centre for Pathology and Forensic Medicine of the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade, from 2008-2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were analysed by the scientific software "Image J" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myofibroblasts were visualized using anti-SMA antibody and quantified in order to predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> capacity for invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out, and a score of 5.72 was suggested as the score of SMA that is significant for the clinical outcome with lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, the average SMA was 7.29 (range 0.39-16.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed correlation of SMA with clinical and pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, i.e. SMA was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with more advanced stage, higher histological grade, greater amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_581'>desmoplasia</z:mpath>, smaller amount of inflammatory infiltrate, lymph node involvement, vascular and perineural invasion and infiltrative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that it is possible to define the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> capacity for invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> by quantifying the myofibroblasts in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stroma of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further investigations are needed to determine targeted therapies to signaling pathways in myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
