<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In total, 146 (of 185) patients were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients presented with KRAS/BRAF <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt), 41 patients with a KRAS codon 12 and nine patients with a KRAS codon 13 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients presented a BRAF-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients of our study were treated with CAPIRI/CAPOX plus cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major differences regarding PFS and OS were observed depending on the mutation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PFS was 8 months in patients with wt-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 5.8 months with codon 12-mutated, 9.9 months with codon 13-mutated and 4.2 months with BRAF-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OS was 23.5 months in patients with wt-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 18.9 months with codon 12-mutated, 26.2 months with codon 13-mutated and 13.0 months with BRAF-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the conventional separation of patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> versus KRAS mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> did not have a significant impact on outcome parameters in the AIO KRK 0104-trial, this analysis demonstrates that markedly differing results are obtained when subtypes of KRAS and BRAF mutation are taken into account </plain></SENT>
