<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment modality for such lesions still needs to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this original report was to evaluate the effectiveness of high-level laser therapy in reducing the severity of facial acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> induced by cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> and two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> showing cetuximab-induced facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> were treated by high-level laser therapy in two 8-min-long consecutive sessions/day over a 4-day treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients wore protective glasses to prevent eye damage related to laser light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, patients were seen once a week for up to 21 days and after 180 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During each day of treatment and each follow-up recall, patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of their acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> (for a total of eight sessions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab-related toxicity and general discomfort visual analogue scales were also recorded in each of these eight sessions in the treated and control areas in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the fourth session of high-level laser therapy, the patients showed a noteworthy decrease in both cetuximab-related toxicity and visual analogue scales, up to a complete regression of the lesions at the end of the follow-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high-level laser therapy was effective in the healing of acneiform <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors with no side effects </plain></SENT>
