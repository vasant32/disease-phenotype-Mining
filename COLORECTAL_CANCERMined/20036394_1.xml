<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of a minimum of 12 nodes is recommended for accurate staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting the number of lymph nodes harvested in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing colectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at our VA hospital from 2002 to 2007 was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was done using univariate as well as multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-three patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average number of nodes retrieved was 14.9 with 92 (51%) containing fewer than 12 lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median number of nodes was 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The only two factors found to have an effect on nodes harvested were pathologist P&lt;0.05 and surgeon experience P=0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors not found to have an impact on number of nodes harvested were age of patient, previous operation, T stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, type of colectomy, bowel prep, laparoscopic versus open technique, or BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis confirmed pathologist and surgeon experience as independent factors associated with number of nodes retrieved P&lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Operating surgeon and examining pathologist were the only factors found to have a significant impact on number of nodes harvested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Meticulous dissection both in and outside of the operating room are indicated </plain></SENT>
