<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 1999, a multidisciplinary panel of experts in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> reviewed the relevant medical literature and issued a consensus recommendation for a 12-lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) minimum examination after resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some authors have shown racial/ethnic differences in receipt of this evidence-based care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, however, none has investigated the correlation between disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> examination and disparities in outcomes after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective analysis used California <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry linked to California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development discharge data (1996-2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analysis, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard models predicted disparities in receipt of an adequate examination and the effect of an inadequate exam on mortality and disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage I and II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> undergoing surgery in California were included; patients with stage III and IV disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37,911 records were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adequate staging occurred in fewer than half of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inadequate examination (&lt;12 LNs) was associated with higher mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hispanics had the lowest odds of receiving an adequate exam; however, blacks, not Hispanics, had the highest risk of mortality compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This disparity was not completely explained by inadequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> exam occurs often and is associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There are disparities in receipt of the minimum exam, but this only explains a small part of the observed disparity in mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Improving the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> examination alone is unlikely to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> disparities </plain></SENT>
