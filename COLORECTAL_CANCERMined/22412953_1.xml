<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end, we have (1) developed a robust and scalable procedure for generation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> hybridization probes, providing &gt;95% first-pass success rate in probe generation to any human target gene and (2) adopted an automated staining procedure for analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and tissue microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The in situ <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression patterns for genes with known as well as unknown tissue expression patterns were analyzed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and malignant tissues to assess procedure specificity and whether in situ hybridization can be used for validating novel antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate concordance between in situ transcript and protein expression patterns of the well-known pathology biomarkers KRT17, CHGA, MKI67, PECAM1 and VIL1, and provide independent validation for novel antibodies to the biomarkers BRD1, EZH2, JUP and SATB2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study provides a foundation for comprehensive in situ gene set or transcriptome analyses of human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
