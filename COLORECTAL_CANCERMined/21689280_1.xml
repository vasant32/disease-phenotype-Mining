<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first 35 months' experience is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Individuals with a positive faecal occult blood test (FOBT) were offered colonoscopy or alternatives if they had significant comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> screening data were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 98 815 FOBT kits issued, 42 523 were returned (43% uptake; 20.79% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 1339/1488 (90%) FOBT-positive participants attended the nurse clinic (57% men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 1057 had an index colonoscopy, 115 had a computed tomography colonoscopy (CTC) and eight had a flexible sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five hundred and seventeen (44%) procedures were '<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>' (no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate in index procedures, including colonoscopy, CTC and flexible sigmoidoscopy, was 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colonoscopies was 62.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size was 5 (1-80) mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In total, 1200 colonoscopies were performed by five accredited colonoscopists (96% completion rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 13 (1%) adverse events with &lt; 1 in 500 patients undergoing polypectomy requiring a transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was one 30-day postsurgical mortality, one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and no colonoscopy-related mortality </plain></SENT>
