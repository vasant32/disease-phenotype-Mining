<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that downregulation of PTCH1 is distinctive for this type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In several other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types, somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been shown to lead to aberrant Hedgehog signaling, but in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> the role of PTCH1 mutations has not been thoroughly studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have analyzed the mutation status of PTCH1 in a series of 33 colorectal serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> by sequencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 23 coding exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected 11 previously known SNPs and eight new alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter included five synonymous changes and two previously unknown missense variations, somatic M319V, and germline V1231A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>V1231A was also present in population controls and likely represents polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The somatic M319V variant does not appear to be an attractive candidate for a disease-associated mutation because in silico analyses did not support the pathogenic nature of the change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A somatic, intronic 1-bp deletion was detected in a short poly(T) stretch in two microsatellite unstable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the three changes had predicted effect on splicing when analyzed in silico </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results did not reveal any clearly deleterious inactivating PTCH1 mutations in our collection of colorectal serrated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the observed downregulation of the PTCH1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These might include, e.g., constantly active MAPK signaling by KRAS or BRAF mutations or silencing of PTCH1 by hypermethylation, and further studies are needed to reveal these mechanisms </plain></SENT>
