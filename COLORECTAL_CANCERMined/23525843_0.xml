<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells and orthotopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> transplant model were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to test the inhibitory role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> in the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation of these four cell lines when the time and concentration increased, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> enhanced the apoptotic rate of these four cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dosage was positively correlated to the apoptotic rate, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells by influencing cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-vivo study suggested that on the seventh day, the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> reduced after administrating with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the twenty-eighth day, the volume of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was significantly different in three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> treatment groups as compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05), and TUNEL assay indicated that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> treated groups was markedly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these cell lines, the expressions of HES1 and Notch2 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> treated groups were remarkably lower than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of JAG1 decreased in SW480 cells (P =0.019), HT-29 cells and HCT-8 cells, but increased in LoVo cells at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of Notch1 was upregulated in these four cell lines, but its expression was significantly upregulated only in LoVo and SW480 cells (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> inhibited the proliferation, induced the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and affected the cell cycle of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After treating with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi>, the expressions of HES1 and Notch2 was obviously inhibited, this indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4806">EGCG</z:chebi> inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by inhibiting HES1 and Notch2 </plain></SENT>
