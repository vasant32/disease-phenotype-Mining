<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The OPTIMOX (stop and go) approach offers a reasonable strategy, but the preventive agent is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is reported that the Kampo medicine, Goshajinkigan (GJG), has recently been considered an effective agent for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxanes</z:chebi> and for vibration sensation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of GJG for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: From 2007, 45 patients treated with modified FOLFOX6 for non-resectable or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (GJG group) received oral administration of 7.5 g/day of GJG every day during mFOLFOX6 therapy and 23 patients (control group) did not receive GJG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> was evaluated during every course according to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC (Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median number of cycles per patient in the GJG group was 13 (range 4-32), and in the control group was 12 (range 4-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> was 1105 mg/m(2) (GJG group) and 1120 mg/m(2) (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in the GJG group was significantly lower than in the control group (p &lt; 0.01, log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> after 10 courses was 0% in the GJG group and 12% in the control group, and after 20 courses was 33% in the GJG group and 75% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The percentage of grade 2 and 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in the GJG group was lower than that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in adverse effects between the two groups except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and influence on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Kampo medicine, Goshajinkigan, is useful in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in non-resectable or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with a FOLFOX regimen </plain></SENT>
