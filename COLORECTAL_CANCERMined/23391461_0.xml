<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve the currently limited success of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell-based immunotherapy, we examined the in vivo dynamics of these adoptively-transferred cells and hypothesized that interleukin (IL)-15 is the potential factor for Vγ9δ2 T cell in vivo survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial of adoptive Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell transfer therapy in six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who received pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with zoledronate (5 μmol/L) and IL-2 (1000 IU/mL) for 14 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Harvested cells, mostly Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, were given intravenously weekly without additional IL-2 eight times in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency, phenotype and common γ-chain cytokine receptor expression of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in peripheral blood was monitored by flow cytometry at each time point during treatment and 4 and 12 weeks after the last administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adoptively transferred Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded well without exogenous IL-2 administration or lymphodepleting preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They maintained effector functions in terms of interferon-γ secretion and prompt release of cytotoxic granules in response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>/ionomycin or isopentenyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi>-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because they are IL-2RαIL-7RαIL-15RαIL-2Rβγ, it is likely that IL-2 or IL-15 is required for their maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of large numbers of functionally active adoptively transferred Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in the absence of exogenous IL-2 implies that an endogenous factor, such as IL-15 transpresentation, is adequate to support these cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
