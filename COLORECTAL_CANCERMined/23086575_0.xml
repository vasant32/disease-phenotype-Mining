<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, using chromatin immunopecipitation (ChIP)-related quantitative PCR, we described reduced plasma levels of the two pericentric heterochromatin-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, by utilizing ChIP-related high-throughput sequencing, we further characterized these modifications in circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma DNA from nucleosomes immunoprecipitated by H3K9me3- and H4K20me3-specific antibodies from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (N = 15) and healthy subjects (N = 15) was subjected to the Roche 454 FLX sequencing, and the generated array of ChIP-enriched sequences were compared to the human reference genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of nucleosomes, of sequence reads and of diverse DNA repetitive elements were statistically compared between the study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total nucleosome amount was not different in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications, lower numbers of sequence reads were detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients as compared with healthy controls (medians in H3K9me3: 32 vs. 61; p &lt; 0.01; in H4K20me3: 54 vs. 88; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Size of fragments was not different in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most abundant sequences were repetitive LINE and SINE elements while simple repeats, LTR, DNA, SAT, and low complexity elements were less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Best discrimination between both groups was achieved by total number of H3K9me3 reads (AUC 0.90) and H3K9me3 LINE elements L1 (AUC 0.93) und L2 (AUC 0.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results confirm earlier findings of lower H3K9me3 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and show LINE elements to be the most frequent and best discriminative markers on modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
