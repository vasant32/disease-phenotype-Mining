<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a novel technique for specific amplification of rare methylated DNA fragments in a high background of unmethylated sequences that avoids the need of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methylation-dependent restriction enzyme GlaI is used to selectively cut methylated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then targeted fragments are tagged using specially designed 'helper' oligonucleotides that are also used to maintain selection in subsequent amplification cycles in a process called 'helper-dependent chain reaction' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The process uses disabled primers called 'drivers' that can only prime on each cycle if the helpers recognize specific sequences within the target amplicon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this way, selection for the sequence of interest is maintained throughout the amplification, preventing amplification of unwanted sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we show how the method can be applied to methylated Septin 9, a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GlaI digestion and subsequent amplification can <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> be done in a single tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A detection sensitivity of 0.1% methylated DNA in a background of unmethylated DNA was achieved, which was similar to the well-established Heavy <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">Methyl</z:chebi> method that requires <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi>-treated DNA </plain></SENT>
