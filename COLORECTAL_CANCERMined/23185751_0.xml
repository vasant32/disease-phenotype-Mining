<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recruited were 366 inpatients and outpatients with stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (CC) from Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> Department of Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 2002 to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A non-randomized concurrent control method was adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to the combination group (treated by CMM + chemotherapy, 189 cases) and the chemotherapy group (177 cases) according to whether they were willing to receive the CMM treatment for more than 6 successive months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using follow-ups at clinics, by letter, and by telephone, the DFS, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year DFS ratios were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlations between DFS and the gender, age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, staging of clinical pathology, pathological type, chemotherapeutic cycle, radiotherapy, CMM treatment, end point event (recurrence and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recurrence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> occurred in 145 cases (39 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>61%) of the 366 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of them, local recurrence occurred in 17 cases (11.72%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> in 45 cases (31.03%), lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in 52 cases (35.86%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in other parts in 53 cases (36.55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of one-factor analysis showed six factors such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, pathological type, staging of clinical pathology, chemotherapeutic cycle, radiotherapy, and CMM treatment were correlated with the DFS, showing statistical difference (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of multifactor analysis showed staging of clinical pathology, chemotherapeutic cycle, and CMM treatment were correlated with the DFS, showing statistical difference (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results of stratified study on the staging of clinical pathology indicated that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> location (P=0.016) and the pathological type (P=0.047) were the independent predictors for DFS of stage II CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median DFS of the two groups could not be calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Results of stratified study on the stages of clinical pathology indicated that CMM treatment (P=0.000) and chemotherapeutic cycle (P=0.017) were independent predictors for DFS of stage III CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As for comparing the composition ratio of the two therapeutic cycles, results showed the baselines of the chemotherapeutic cycle of the two groups were balanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further comparison showed the median DFS for the chemotherapy group at stage III was 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>16 months, while it could not be calculated in the combination group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The DFS, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year DFS ratios were 92%, 72%, 61%, and 59%, respectively in the stage III CC combination group, while they were 74%, 50%, 36%, and 20%, respectively in the stage IlI CC chemotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CMM combined chemotherapy could prolong the DFS of stage III CC patients after radical cure </plain></SENT>
