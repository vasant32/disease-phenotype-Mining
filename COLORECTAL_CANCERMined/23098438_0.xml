<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The therapeutic ratio shifts with different 5FU/LV regimens and none yet serve as the internationally accepted Gold Standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bimonthly regimen of high dose leucovorin is reported to be less toxic and more effective than monthly low dose regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here compare therapeutic responses and survival benefit of the two regimens in poor prognosis patients with advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 35 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were subjected to de Gramont and Mayo Clinic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were treated with high dose folinic acid (200 mg/m2), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 5%, 5-FU (400 mg/m2) and 22 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CIV (600 mg/m2) for two consecutive days every two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients had failed responses to previous chemotherapy and were above sixty years of age with poor general status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (six below 60 years) with progressive disease were subjected to low dose folinic acid (20 mg/m2)for five days, 5FU(425 mg/m2) injection bolus for 5 days, every five weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An initial evaluation was made in sixty days and responders were reevaluated at sixty days interval or earlier in case of clinical impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on positive prognosis, the therapy was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of treatment response was made on the basis of WHO criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 44% in thirty four evaluable patients, with 4 complete responses (11.8%) and 11 (32.4%) partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The two schedules were well tolerated, whereas, mild toxicity without WHO Grade â‰¥ 2 events was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The response duration was extended (12 months) in a few patients with age above sixty years treated by high dose bimonthly regimen of 5FU/LV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The regimens are safe and effective in advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients with poor general status </plain></SENT>
