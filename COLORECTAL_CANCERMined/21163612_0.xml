<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Within the Netherlands Cohort Study (1986), we examined associations between alcohol consumption, the alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C) genotype, and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up period of 7.3 years, 594 CRC cases with information on genotype and baseline alcohol intake were available for analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjusted incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In subjects who reported to have consumed equal amounts of total alcohol both 5 years before baseline and at baseline, drinkers of ≥30g of alcohol per day with the ADH1C*2/*2 genotype were associated-although not statistically significant-with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> relative to abstainers with the ADH1C*1/*1 genotype (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 0.68, 5.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk estimate in this exposure group increased slightly when compared with light drinkers of ≥0.5-&lt;5g/day with the ADH1C*1/*1 genotype (RR: 2.32, 95% CI: 0.80, 6.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interaction term however, was not statistically significant (P&gt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In subjects who reported to have consumed equal amounts of total alcohol both 5 years before baseline and at baseline, drinkers of ≥30g of alcohol per day were associated-although not statistically significant-with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> relative to abstainers (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 0.80, 2.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This risk estimate for high-level drinkers became stronger when compared with light drinkers (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As main effect of genotype, we observed that the ADH1C*2/*2 genotype was associated with a 42% increase in risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when compared with the ADH1C*1/*1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, both genotype and alcohol consumption were associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Owing to limited statistical power, we found no apparent evidence for the ADH1C genotype as effect modifier of the relationship between alcohol intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the interaction deserves further investigation in larger genetic epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
