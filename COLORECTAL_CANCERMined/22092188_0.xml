<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate adherence in a cohort without these barriers to ascertain realistically optimal adherence rates and to examine remaining barriers among relatively advantaged individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it employed a sample of 6889 patients presenting for executive health care from 2005 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adherence varied across <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (79%), mammography (89%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> screening (91%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> immunization (82%), and pneumococcal vaccination (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regressions revealed that age, education, alcohol use concerns, and being married were positively associated with adherence to certain services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals without the usual barriers to care have variable, less-than-ideal rates of adherence to preventive services, which correlate with some health behaviors and demographics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Understanding the predictors of adherence may inform quality improvement processes aimed at optimizing disease prevention </plain></SENT>
