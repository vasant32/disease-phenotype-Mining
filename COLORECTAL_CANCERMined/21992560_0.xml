<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between previously demonstrated thermosensitising effects of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="53511">block copolymer</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi>, and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression in an experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells were treated with low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (43°C) alone or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronics</z:chebi> L10 (3 mg/mL), L61 (0.3 mg/mL), or L64 (0.5 mg/mL) for 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adinosine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) levels and cell viability were determined using standard assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hsp70 expression was quantified by western blot for cells treated with L10, L61, and L64 at doses specified above and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> P85 (10 mg/mL) alone and in combination with heat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BDIX rats with flank <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were used to study the effect of L61 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> on Hsp70 expression in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, treatment with L10, L61, and L64 plus low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> lead to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ATP levels to between 8 and 66% of untreated control after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum expression of Hsp70 was observed at 9 h following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> treatment reduced Hsp70 expression for up to 6 hours, and L10 appeared to completely inhibit the Hsp70 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo, Hsp70 expression was increased 5 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in BDIX rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> models and no Hsp70 expression was observed in L61 pre-treated and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Pluronic</z:chebi> effectively improves hyperthermic and low-grade hyperthermic treatment in part due to reduction of Hsp70 expression </plain></SENT>
