<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Thermal ablation is safe and effective for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains problematic with respect to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with 132 liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> measuring 0.8-5.0 cm were treated with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 38 cases and others in 51, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control, complications, and long-term survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete ablation was achieved in 117 of 132 (88.6%) nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 117 (14.5%) successfully treated nodules developed local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, a significant trend toward a lower local recurrence rate with MWA was observed (8.6% for MWA vs. 20.3% for RFA, P=0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that number of cycles of chemotherapy was the significant prognostic factor for overall recurrence (P=0.015), whereas disease-free interval was the significant prognostic factor for distant recurrence (P=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ablation modality showed potential prognostic significance for local recurrence (P=0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major complications occurred in 1.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No procedure-related mortalities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 1, 2, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates after the initial ablation were 84.9, 59.6, 48.8, and 36.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>MWA has the potential to result in less local recurrence than RFA </plain></SENT>
