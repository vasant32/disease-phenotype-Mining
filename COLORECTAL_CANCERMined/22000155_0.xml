<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 1999, 6220 CÃ´te d'Or inhabitants (France) were first-diagnosed with a colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and 2389 with an invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impact of the rural-urban place of residence and of a physician location in municipalities on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection rates was studied using Poisson regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: World-standardized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate was significantly higher in urban areas (102 [95% CI: 97-107]) than in rural areas (78 [95% CI: 72-84]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of the absence of physicians in municipalities was only found in rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The detection rate ratio associated with the absence of a primary care physician was 0.70 [95% CI: 0.61-0.81], and the detection rate ratio associated with the absence of a gastroenterologist was 0.75 [95% CI: 0.64-0.89] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence rates were similar in urban and rural areas with only marginal variations related to physician location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested a differential impact of geographical variables on the detection rates of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to examine socio-economic factors likely to be involved in these disparities </plain></SENT>
