<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) measurements performed preoperatively and during the early postoperative period were examined prospectively to assess their prognostic value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients receiving curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2000 and 2004, 1,361 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent curative surgery at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital were enrolled prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CEA was measured prior to surgery and during the third or fourth postoperative week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was length of postoperative disease-free survival, and prognostic importance was determined using the log-rank test and Cox regression hazard model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred (44.1%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients had high CEA concentrations preoperatively, and 188 (13.8%) patients retained high values postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the median follow-up period of 61 (6-108) months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurred in 313 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis TNM staging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, preoperative CEA concentration, and postoperative CEA concentration affected the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, the prognostic importance of postoperative CEA was retained (95% CI, 1.73-3.01; HR = 2.28) but that of preoperative CEA was lost (95% CI, 0.82-1.33; HR = 1.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> recurred earlier in patients with high postoperative CEA concentrations; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> to the liver was common (72.3%) among patients in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative CEA concentration is an independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with high postoperative CEA values should receive aggressive follow-up examinations for early relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with special attention paid to recurrence at the liver </plain></SENT>
