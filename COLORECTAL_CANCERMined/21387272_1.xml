<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are at increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current screening recommendations for these individuals are based on expert opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated optimal screening strategies for individuals with various degrees of family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> based on a cost-effectiveness analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model was used to estimate costs and effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening strategies, varying by the age at which screening was started and stopped and by screening interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors defined 4 risk groups, characterized by the number of affected first-degree relatives and their age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk groups, the optimal screening strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $50,000 per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The optimal screening strategy for individuals with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed after age 50 years was 6 colonoscopies every 5 years starting at age 50 years, compared with 4 colonoscopies every 7 years starting at age 50 years for average risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimal strategy had 10 colonoscopies every 4 years for individuals with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed before age 50 years, 13 colonoscopies every 3 years for individuals with 2 or more first-degree relatives diagnosed after age 50 years, and 15 colonoscopies every 3 years for individuals with 2 or more first-degree relatives of whom at least 1 was diagnosed before age 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The optimal screening strategy varies considerably with the number of affected first-degree relatives and their age of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shorter screening intervals than the currently recommended 5 years may be appropriate for the highest risk individuals </plain></SENT>
