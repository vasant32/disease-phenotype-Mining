<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study of 85 patients undergoing elective colon and rectal surgery during 2 years period was performed, divided in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A (N = 46) with patients who underwent mechanical bowel preparation, and group B (N = 39) patients without mechanical bowel preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed: gender, age, preoperative difficulties, diagnostic colonoscopy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization, operation performed, pathohystological findings, Dukes classification, number of lymphonodes inspected, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, other organ infiltrations, mean time of surgery, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics, pathohystological findings, the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and type of surgical procedure did not significantly differentiate the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significance revealed in mean time of surgery (138/178 minutes) in favor of patients with MBP (p = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) for elective colorectal surgery is not advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It does not influence radicalism of the procedure, does not decrease neither postoperative complications, nor hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
