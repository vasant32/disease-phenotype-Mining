<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: The prospective study was conducted with 432 cases treated with 5-FU and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were followed-up from May 2006 to May 2011 and 168 patients died during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>XRCC1 and XRCC3 genotype polymorphisms were based upon the PCR-CTPP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was shown that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln and XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphisms were associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying XRCC1 Gln/Gln, Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes positively associated with 2.78-, 2.86- and 3.0-fold <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination of XRCC1 399Gln allele and XRCC3 241Met allele showed a significantly strong association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR=3.46, 95%CI=1.65- 5.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is first to report that the XRCC1 and XRCC3 gene polymorphisms are useful as a surrogate marker of clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with 5-FU/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> combination chemotherapy in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
