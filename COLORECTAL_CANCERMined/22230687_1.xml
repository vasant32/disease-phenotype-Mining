<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patulin is a fungal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="25442">mycotoxin</z:chebi> of Aspergilus and Penicillium that is commonly found in rotting fruits and exerts its potential toxic effect mainly by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of patulin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells as well as its intracellular mechanism has been controversial and not clearly defined yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, patulin was found to induce G1/S accumulation and cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> accompanied by caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage and ATF3 expression in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line HCT116 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ser/Thr phosphorylation of a transcription factor, EGR-1, was increased while its expression did not change upon patulin treatment to the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of ATF3 and EGR-1 using their respective siRNAs showed EGR-1 dependent ATF3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment of the cells with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28939">N-acetylcysteine</z:chebi> (NAC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) revealed that patulin induced ATF3 expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were dependent on ROS generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATF3 expression was also increased by patulin in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell types, Caco2 and SW620 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data present a new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> molecular mechanism of patulin, suggesting EGR-1 and ATF3 as critical targets for the development of anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this regard, patulin could be a candidate for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
