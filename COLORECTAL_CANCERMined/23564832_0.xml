<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs from 14 consecutive patients with Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> oncogene homolog (KRAS) <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with synchronous or metachronous unresectable metastatic lesions were measured using the CellSearch system between January 2009 and December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTCs were measured before and after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regimen consisted of four courses (three months) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> with oral S-1 (SOX) + panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten (71%) out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had no detectable CTCs after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight out of these ten patients received further chemotherapy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were completely resected in the other two patients; none of these patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within a year after starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients with CTCs continued to have CTCs after chemotherapy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four of these patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within eight months after starting chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of the patients who had no detectable CTCs after the chemotherapy was significantly better than that of those who had CTCs even after the chemotherapy (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTCs after preliminary chemotherapy may be useful in predicting the response to further anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
