<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi>, 24,25(OH)2D3, 1,25(OH)2D3 and VDBP levels in 50 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients before and during 2,000 IU daily oral D3 supplementation for six months and in 263 archived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum PTH levels and PBMC 24-OHase activity were also measured during D3 supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TagSNPs in CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and GC genes were genotyped in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the association between these SNPs and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> metabolites levels before and after D3 supplementation was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean baseline serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> level was less than 32 ng/mL in 65 % of the 313 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 50 patients receiving D3 supplementation, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> increased (p = 0.008), PTH decreased (p = 0.036) and 24,25(OH)2D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, VDBP levels and PBMC 24-OHase activity were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GC SNP rs222016 was associated with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels at baseline while rs4588 and rs2282679 were associated with lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels both before and after D3 supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CYP2R1 rs12794714 and rs10500804 SNPs were significantly associated with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> levels after supplementation but not with baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results show that D3 supplementation increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GC rs4588 and rs2283679 SNPs were associated with increased risk of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> insufficiency and suboptimal increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> levels after D3 supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individuals with these genotypes may require higher D3 supplementation doses to achieve <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> sufficiency </plain></SENT>
