<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimens for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have been demonstrated in adults ≥ 75 years of age who are enrolled in clinical trials, safety and effectiveness outside the trial setting are less established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively collected cases of patients ≥ 75 years of age who were diagnosed with stage III and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and initiated treatment between January 2000 and January 2007 at 2 academic hospitals in Boston, MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were matched in a 1:2 ratio to controls who were &lt; 75 years of age by hospital site, stage of disease (stage III vs. metastatic) and line of therapy (first- or second-line or beyond) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary study endpoints were grade ≥ 3 treatment-associated toxicities and intolerance (number of dose delays/reductions and hospital/facility admissions during treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoint was overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 84 patients ≥ 75 years of age (25% ≥ 80 years) and 168 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cohort, 77% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 75% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, and 60% were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> as first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in grade ≥ 3 treatment-associated toxicities between the patients and the controls (71.4% vs. 68.5%, respectively; P = .63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further there was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls for combined endpoints of any grade ≥ 3 toxicity or hospital/facility admission (P = .92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 52 months, 2-year overall survival was similar between patients and controls (43% vs. 52%, respectively; P = .87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Older adults with stage III and metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated outside of a clinical trial experienced safety and effectiveness of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy regimens that was comparable to that of younger adults </plain></SENT>
