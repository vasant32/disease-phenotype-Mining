<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The nationwide Swedish Family-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Database was used to calculate standardized incidence ratios for common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> among immigrants compared to Swedes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immigrants were classified into "high-risk" countries when their risk was increased, into "low-risk" when their risk was decreased and into "other" when their risk was nonsignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those who immigrated at younger age (&lt;30 years), we found an increasing trend for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in low-risk men and high-risk women </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the unchanged trend of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> among those who immigrated at younger ages and an increasing trend for those who migrated at older ages may suggest a limited effect for environmental exposures, especially at younger age </plain></SENT>
