<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the methods currently used, a case is classified as KRAS-mutated when approximately 20% of the cells bear an activating KRAS mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These considerations raise the question of whether cells with a mutated KRAS can be found in mCRC cases classified as KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> when more sensitive methods are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the issue arises of whether these mCRC cases with low proportion of KRAS-mutated cells could account at least in part for the therapeutic failure of anti-EGFR therapies that occur in 40-60% of cases classified as KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the classical assays with a very sensitive test, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48010">locked nucleic acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi>) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), capable of detecting KRAS-mutated alleles at extremely low frequency (detection sensitivity limit 0.25% mutated DNA/<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By analyzing a cohort of 213 mCRC patients for KRAS mutations, we found a 20.6% discordance between the sequencing/TheraScreen methods and the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi>-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, 44 mCRC patients initially considered KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> were reclassified as KRAS mutated by using the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="48010">LNA</z:chebi>-PCR test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients were more numerous among individuals displaying a clinical failure to anti-EGFR therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Failure to respond to these biological treatments occurred even in the absence of mutations in other EGFR pathway components such as BRAF </plain></SENT>
