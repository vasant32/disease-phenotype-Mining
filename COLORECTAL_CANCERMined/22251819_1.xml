<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The newly discovered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>-associated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-1 (MACC1) gene is a key regulator of the HGF/MET pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of HGF/MET signaling is reported as a prognostic marker for <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, early stage invasion, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High expression levels of MACC1 have been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and reduced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potential links between the genetic diversity of the MACC1 locus and overall survival are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the association between MACC1 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and overall survival in a large cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 318 subjects with histopathologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at the Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Austria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival data were provided by the federal agency for statistics in Austria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens; six tagging SNPs (rs1990172, rs3114446, rs10275612, rs3095007, rs3095009, and rs7780032), capturing most of the common variants of the MACC1 locus, were genotyped by SNaPshot assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a mean follow up period of 5.3 (Â± 1.0) years, 94 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the G-allele of SNP rs1990172 showed a significantly decreased overall survival (additive HR = 1.38 [1.05-1.82]; p = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and UICC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage confirmed this result (HR = 1.49 [1.12-1.98]; p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other investigated genetic variants of the MACC1 gene were not significantly associated with overall survival (p-values &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study investigated the influence of MACC1 tagging polymorphisms on overall survival suggesting SNP rs1990172 as a predictor for reduced overall survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be required to validate our findings </plain></SENT>
