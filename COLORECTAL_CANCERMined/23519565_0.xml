<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive web-based tool called the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Interactive Navigator™ (OIN) appears promising in addressing these gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present qualitative inquiry explores the perceptions of individuals concerning the OIN™, as a complementary resource to support psychosocial adjustment to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and guide access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: As part of a pilot multi-method multi-site study, 151 individuals newly diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> were offered unrestricted access to the OIN™ for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative interviews were undertaken with a subset of participants (n = 20) to explore their experience with the tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interviews were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The OIN™ was reported to be instrumental in fulfilling participants' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> information and supportive care needs, particularly early in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More specifically, the tool was seen as a "go to" resource to obtain more detailed information, validate information provided elsewhere, and pace exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Content also was perceived to be of high quality, practical, and comprehensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants underscored how the tool improved their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> knowledge, facilitated communication, and prepared them for subsequent medical consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Given the rapid proliferation of web-based tools of varying scope, quality, and relevance, the exploration of users' perspectives is key to informing the development, refinement, implementation, and sustainability of promising web-based tools such as the OIN™ </plain></SENT>
