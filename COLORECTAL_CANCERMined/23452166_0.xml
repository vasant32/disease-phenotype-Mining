<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report our experience with ureteroscopic laser ablation of upper tract urothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (UTUC) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch Syndrome</z:e> (LS), as defined by a documented germline mutation in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi>-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To increase awareness among urologists about UTUC in this unique patient population and refer to genetic counselling when appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical and pathological data on 13 consecutive patients with UTUC and documented <z:chebi fb="6" ids="16768">MSH</z:chebi>-2 mutation comprising 15 involved renal units were retrospectively collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ureteroscopic evaluations involved biopsy and laser treatment with combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> garnet (YAG) lasers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumours</z:e> were graded from 1 to 3 according to the 1973 World Health Organisation classification by a single pathologist evaluating cell block preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean patient age at initial presentation was 56.5 years, with six of 13 patients having metachronous bilateral UT disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 59 months with a mean number of surveillances of 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 15 affected renal units, 10/15 (67%) of initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> involved the ureter with mean lesion size of 17.5 mm, while five of 15 (33%) involved the intrarenal collecting system with mean lesion size of 25 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ureteroscopy cleared 13/15 (87%) lesions and four of those 13 (31%) needed staged procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal preservation rate was 14/15 (93%) with one nephroureterectomy and one segmental ureterectomy performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient developed metastatic UTUC after 40 months surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005695" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder tumours</z:e> but seven of the 13 (54%) developed them within 10 months of the initial ureteroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LS who develop UTUC present at younger ages and appear to be more likely to have bilateral UT disease over their lifetimes vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> UTUC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ureteroscopic laser ablation offers a good renal preservation rate with reasonable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control in patients willing to undergo endoscopic surveillance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Development of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005695" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bladder tumours</z:e> is common </plain></SENT>
