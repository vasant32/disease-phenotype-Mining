<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice engrafted with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, SRC over-expression favors <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and is accompanied by a robust increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>How SRC contributes to this tumorigenic process is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed SRC oncogenic signaling in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by means of a novel quantitative proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method is based on stable isotope labeling with amino acids of xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> by the addition of [(13)C(6)]-lysine into mouse food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An incorporation level greater than 88% was obtained in xenograft <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> after 30 days of the heavy lysine diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> allowed the identification of 61 proteins that exhibited a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and/or association with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins upon SRC expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These mainly included molecules implicated in vesicular trafficking and signaling and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of these proteins were specific targets of SRC signaling in vivo, as they were not identified by analysis via stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that oncogenic signaling induced by SRC in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> significantly differs from that induced by SRC in cell culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We next confirmed this notion experimentally with the example of the vesicular trafficking protein and SRC substrate TOM1L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found that whereas TOM1L1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> only slightly affected SRC-induced proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in vitro, it drastically decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in xenografted <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We thus concluded that this vesicular trafficking protein plays an important role in SRC-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data show that SILAC analysis in mouse xenografts is a valuable approach for deciphering tyrosine kinase oncogenic signaling in vivo </plain></SENT>
