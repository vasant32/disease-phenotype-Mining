<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we elucidated the prognostic significance of lymphatic vessels, different types of macrophages and the balance between different macrophage types in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the impact of density, type and location of macrophages on the clinical behavior of 159 primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> using CD68 as a pan-macrophage marker and CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1 as a marker for regulatory/suppressive macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Podoplanin was used as a pan-lymphatic vessel marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high number of CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1(+) peritumoral macrophages positively correlated with survival (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in more advanced disease (Stage IV), the patients with a high number of peritumoral or intratumoral CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1(+) macrophages had a shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.05, and p = 0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a low number of suppressive intratumoral CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1(+) macrophages among high numbers of CD68(+) macrophages correlated with a low number of distant recurrences (p = 0.01) and to fewer disease relapses exclusively in the liver as well (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high number of intratumoral lymphatics correlated with poor survival (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this work suggest that the type of macrophages, number of lymphatic vessels and their location contribute to the clinical behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in a disease stage-specific manner </plain></SENT>
