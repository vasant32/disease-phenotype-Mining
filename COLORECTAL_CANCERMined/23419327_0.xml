<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual framework to guide research on shared decision-making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening among persons at average risk and their providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based upon a comprehensive review of empirical literature and relevant theories, a conceptual framework was developed that incorporated patient characteristics, cultural beliefs, provider/health care system variables, health belief/knowledge/stage of adoption variables, and shared decision-making between patients and providers that may predict behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relationships among concepts in the framework, shared decision-making process and outcomes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening behavior were proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Directions for future research were presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many of the concepts in the proposed framework have been examined in prior research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these elements have not been combined previously to explain shared decision-making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Research is needed to test the proposed relationships and hypotheses and to refine the framework </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Findings from future research guided by the proposed framework may inform clinical practice to facilitate shared decision-making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
