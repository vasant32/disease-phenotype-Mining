<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study assesses HRQoL in several health states of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and explores factors influencing HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 508 Finnish <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (aged 26-96; <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> 56%; female 47%) assessed their HRQoL using generic 15D and EQ-5D and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into five groups: primary treatment, rehabilitation, remission, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, and palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' HRQoL was compared with population reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate modelling was used to find factors associated with HRQoL scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HRQoL of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients is fairly good and comparable to that of the standardized general population except for those under palliative care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean 15D score of patients in the primary treatment group was 0.889 (95% CI: 0.869-0.914), in rehabilitation 0.877(0.855-0.907), in remission 0.886 (0.875-0.903), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> 0.860 (0.844-0.878), and in palliative care 0.758 (0.716-0.808) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The respective EQ-5D scores were 0.760 (0.699-0.823), 0.835 (0.777-0.881), 0.850 (0.828-0.882), 0.820 (0.783-0.858), and 0.643 (0.546-0.747) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, pain, age, and financial difficulties had a marked negative impact on HRQoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients' mean HRQoL scores varied considerably depending on the HRQoL instrument used, but remained surprisingly good Up to the palliative stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition to age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related symptoms, financial difficulties also had a clear negative impact on HRQoL,which needs to be taken into consideration when supporting patient HRQoL. © 2013 The Authors </plain></SENT>
