<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The field of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has rapidly expanded after the discovery of the MutHLS repair system in bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the mid 1990s yeast and human homologues to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> MutL and MutS had been identified and their contribution to hereditary non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>) was under intense investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human MutS homologue 6 protein (hMSH6), was first reported in 1995 as a G:T binding partner (GTBP) of hMSH2, forming the hMutSα mismatch-binding complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signal transduction from each DNA-bound hMutSα complex is accomplished by the hMutLα heterodimer (hMLH1 and hPMS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular mechanisms and cellular regulation of individual MMR proteins are now areas of intensive research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review will focus on molecular mechanisms associated with mismatch binding, as well as emerging evidence that MutSα, and in particular, MSH6, is a key protein in MMR-dependent DNA damage response and communication with other DNA repair pathways within the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSH6 is unstable in the absence of MSH2, however it is the DNA lesion-binding partner of this heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSH6, but not MSH2, has a conserved Phe-X-Glu motif that recognizes and binds several different DNA structural distortions, initiating different cellular responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hMSH6 also contains the nuclear localization sequences required to shuttle hMutSα into the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, upon binding to O(6)meG:T, MSH6 triggers a DNA damage response that involves altered phosphorylation within the N-terminal disordered domain of this unique protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While many investigations have focused on MMR as a post-replication DNA repair mechanism, MMR proteins are expressed and active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is much more to be discovered about regulatory cellular roles that require the presence of MutSα and, in particular, MSH6 </plain></SENT>
