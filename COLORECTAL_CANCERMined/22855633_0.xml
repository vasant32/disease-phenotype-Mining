<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study of preoperative FR-WBH in patients undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery to evaluate perioperative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>-induced immunomodulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial was conducted as a subject-blinded, controlled, randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the FR-WBH group (n=9) were treated with FR-WBH before operation under <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation; the target core temperature was 39 (0.5)°C with 1 h warming and 2 h plateau phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects in the control group (n=9) were treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were acquired before and after treatment, after operation, and 24, 48 h, and 5 days after the end of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were measured: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-6/10, heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) 60, 70, and 90, human leucocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and LPS-binding protein (LBP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> were increased in the FR-WBH group after treatment [HSP60, 48 h postop: 143 (41)% vs 89 (42)%, P=0.04; HSP90, postop: 111 (33)% vs 64 (31)%, P=0.04; HSP70: P=0.40; FR-WBH vs control, P-values for area under the level/time curve] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF-α levels were elevated after surgery in the control group and remained near baseline in the FR-WBH group [24 h postop: 73 (68)% vs 151 (72)%, P=0.04] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PCT increased in both groups 24 h after surgery; in the control group, this increase was significantly higher (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences for IL, HLA-DR, or LBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The immune system to react to surgical stress, as measured by a panel of laboratory indicators, might be improved by preoperative FR-WBH </plain></SENT>
