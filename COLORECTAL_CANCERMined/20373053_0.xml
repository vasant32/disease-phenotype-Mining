<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 levels were detected by C12 protein chip diagnostic system in 80 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and the association of their preoperative status with the patients' OS was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with positive preoperative serum CA19-9, CA125, and CEA had a worse survival comparing with those negative patients, the difference in CA19-9 and CA125 reached statistical significance (Log rank test, P&lt;0.05), but the difference of CEA did not achieve statistical significance (Log rank test, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The OS of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with three positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (TMs)&lt;1 or 2 positive TMs&lt;negative TM, simultaneously positive serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 was the most dismal predicting factor for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spearman correlations revealed that the preoperative serum status of CA19-9 (P=0.000), CEA (P=0.000), and CA125 (P=0.000) had correlations with stage; the preoperative serum CA125 status (r=-0.385, P=0.000) and stage (r=-0.457, P=0.000) and location (r=0.223, P=0.047) had correlations with OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis with Cox regression model showed that only stage (P=0.000) and the preoperative serum CA125 status (P=0.016) were independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The preoperative status of serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 had correlations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The simultaneously positive serum CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 was the most dismal predicting factor for OS of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative serum CA125 status and stage were independent prognostic factors for OS of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
