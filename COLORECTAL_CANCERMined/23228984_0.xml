<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, S-1, and irinotecan has been reported to be a promising regimen for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab (BV) to combine with irinotecan and S-1 has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of BV combined with irinotecan plus S-1, and to observe the safety and efficacy of this regimen as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study initially had been planned as a phase I/II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty mg/m(2) of irinotecan on days 1 and 8, 80 mg/m(2) of S-1 for 14 consecutive days, and two doses of BV (Level 1; 10 mg/kg, Level -1; 7.5 mg/kg) were administered on day 1 every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled in phase I of the study between January 2008 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose-limiting toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MTD and RD of BV were determined to be 10 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An independent review committee was scheduled to evaluate safety in phase I, but this trial closed early due to toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with the combination of irinotecan, S-1 and BV as second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
