<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous small scale sequencing studies have indicated that DNA polymerase β (pol β) variants are present on average in 30% of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of varying tissue origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these variants have been shown to have aberrant enzyme function in vitro and to induce cellular transformation and/or genomic instability in vivo, suggesting that their presence is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> or its progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the human POLB gene was sequenced in a collection of 134 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and was found to contain coding region mutations in 40% of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variants map to many different sites of the pol β protein and are not clustered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many variants are nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions predicted to affect enzyme function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subset of these variants was found to have reduced enzyme activity in vitro and failed to fully rescue pol β-deficient cells from methylmethane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33543">sulfonate</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> harboring variants with reduced enzyme activity may have compromised base excision repair function, as evidenced by our methylmethane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33543">sulfonate</z:chebi> sensitivity studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such compromised base excision repair may drive <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> by leading to an increase in mutagenesis or genomic instability </plain></SENT>
