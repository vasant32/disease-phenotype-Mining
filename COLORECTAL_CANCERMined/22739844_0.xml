<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine whether diaphragm resection during partial hepatectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> influences short-term perioperative outcomes and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographics, treatments, and outcomes of 442 patients who underwent hepatic resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> from 1996 to 2010 at a high-volume center were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence and survival were measured from the date of metastectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actuarial curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-ranks testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate predictors of worse survival were compared using a Cox-proportional hazards model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 442 patients underwent hepatectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 34 required simultaneous diaphragm resection (DR) and 408 did not (LR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences existed in patient demographics or comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DR group had longer median operative times (336 vs. 267 min, p = 0.0008) but had comparable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was shorter in the DR group compared to the LR group (18.8 vs. 36 months, p = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When controlling for potential cofounders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> size &gt; 5 cm (HR 1.45 95 % CI (1.08-1.99), p = 0.015) and diaphragm resection (HR = 1.72 95 % CI (1.03-2.86), p = 0.038) predicted worse survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous diaphragm resection during partial hepatectomy does not significantly influence perioperative morbidity or mortality despite longer operative times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, patients who require diaphragm resection have less favorable survival rates as compared to those who do not </plain></SENT>
