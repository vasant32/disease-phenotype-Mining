<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A community-based sample of 22 first-degree relatives of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> survivors were recruited via a media release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at baseline and at six weeks (post-intervention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included health behaviours (physical activity, television viewing, diet, alcohol, body mass index, waist circumference and smoking), health-related quality of life (Short Form-36) and perceived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intervention satisfaction levels were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intervention included six telephone health coaching sessions, a participant handbook and a pedometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It focused on behavioural risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> [physical activity, diet (red and processed meat consumption, fruit and vegetable intake), alcohol, weight management and smoking], and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From baseline to six weeks, improvements were observed for minutes moderate-vigorous physical activity (150.7 minutes), processed meat intake (-1.2 serves/week), vegetable intake (1 serve/day), alcohol intake (-0.4 standard drinks/day), body mass index (-1.4 kg/m2), and waist circumference (-5.1 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements were also observed for physical (3.3) and mental (4.4) health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, compared with baseline, participants were more likely to meet Australian recommendations post-intervention for: moderate-vigorous physical activity (27.3 vs 59.1%); fruit intake (68.2 vs 81.8%); vegetable intake (4.6 vs 18.2%); alcohol consumption (59.1 vs 72.7%); body mass index (31.8 vs 45.5%) and waist circumference (18.2 vs 27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At six weeks participants were more likely to believe a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was related to family history, and there was a decrease in their perceived risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in their lifetime following participation in CanPrevent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The intervention retention rate was 100%, participants reported that it was highly acceptable and they would recommend it to others at risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Positive behaviour change achieved through this intervention approach has the potential to impact on the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A large scale randomised controlled trial is required to confirm the positive results of this acceptability and short-term effectiveness study </plain></SENT>
