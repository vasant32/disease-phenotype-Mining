<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the analytical sensitivity of a DNA methylation assay on partial stool samples, and estimated the DNA degradation in stool over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we explored the detection of DNA methylation in fecal immunochemical test (FIT) fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Partial stool samples of colonoscopy-negative individuals were homogenized with stool homogenization buffer, spiked with different numbers of HCT116 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and kept at room temperature for 0, 24, 48, 72 and 144 h before DNA isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analytical sensitivity was determined by the lowest number of cells that yielded positive test results by DNA methylation or mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation in FIT fluid was measured in 11 CRC patients and 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analytical sensitivity for detecting DNA methylation was 3000 cells per gram stool, compared to 60000 cells per gram stool for detection of DNA mutations in the same stool samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No degradation up to 72 h was noted when a conservation buffer was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation was detected in 4/11 CRC FIT samples and in none of the 20 control FIT samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Methylation based stool DNA testing showed a high analytical sensitivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> DNA in partial stool samples, which was hardly influenced by DNA degradation over time, provided an adequate buffer was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of detecting DNA methylation in FIT fluid demonstrates the opportunity to combine testing for occult blood with DNA methylation in the same collection device </plain></SENT>
