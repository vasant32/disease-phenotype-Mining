<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The use of CD133 as a marker for identifying and isolating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> stem cells (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi>) is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is not clear whether the pattern of expression is influenced by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed the expression of CD133 in the SW620 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line, which produces subpopulations with different levels of CD133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD133(neg) and CD133(hi) SW620 cells were isolated and compared in hanging drop spheroid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 was examined under different culture conditions and following nutrient withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SW620 cells express the CD133 antigen at variable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD133(neg) and CD133(hi) SW620 cells can be separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and, when grown as adherent cells in liquid culture, are serially passaged without changes to the CD133 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the CD133 antigen is re-expressed when the CD133(neg) cells are deprived of nutrients or grown as non-adherent cells in spheroid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that the presence of the CD133 antigen does not identify a stem cell population of SW620 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD133 is dynamic and is modulated during certain cell culture conditions, suggesting that changes in expression may be mediated by the energy supply available to the cells </plain></SENT>
