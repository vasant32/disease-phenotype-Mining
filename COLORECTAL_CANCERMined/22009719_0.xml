<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Understanding racial/ethnic disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening by family history risk could identify critical opportunities for patient and provider interventions tailored to specific racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (BC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) disparities varied by family history risk using a large, multiethnic population-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, BC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were evaluated separately with weighted multivariate regression analyses, and stratified by family history risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Screening was defined for BC as mammogram within the past 2 years for women aged 40 to 64 years; for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, screening was defined as annual fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years, or colonoscopy within the past 10 years for adults aged 50 to 64 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found no significant BC screening disparities by race/ethnicity or income in the family history risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Racial/ethnic disparities were more evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, and the Latino-white gap widened among individuals with family history risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among adults with a family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the magnitude of the Latino-white difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.60) was more substantial than that for individuals with no family history (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of their family history widened the Latino-white gap in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More aggressive interventions that enhance the communication between Latinos and their physicians about family history and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk could reduce the substantial Latino-white screening disparity in Latinos most susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
