<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) alternating with systemic therapy after surgical resection may improve survival after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with liver-only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> amenable to resection/cryoablation were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous adjuvant chemotherapy for a completely resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternating courses of HAI and systemic therapy included floxuridine (FUDR) by HAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic chemotherapy consisted of bolus leucovorin (LV) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine patients had complete resection of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, with 44% having more than 4 hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and 78% having bilobar disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients had HAI FUDR alternating with systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients received a median of 3.5 cycles (range, 1-4) and 3 cycles (range, 0-6) of therapy with HAI FUDR and systemic therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time of final analysis the estimated median disease-free survival and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e>-free survival was 1.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.1) and 1.8 years (95% CI, 1.8-not available), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (31%) were alive at this writing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients had a minimum of 5.5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who underwent complete resection with unfavorable characteristics demonstrates apparent improvement in outcome compared with historical series treated with surgery alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However the results of this trial and other randomized trials of HAI do not appear to support its use at this time because of the development of more effective systemic options </plain></SENT>
