<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: There is little information on longitudinal patterns of participation in faecal occult blood test (FOBT) based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening or on demographic or behavioural factors associated with participation in re-screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of an agreed system for describing participatory behaviour over multiple rounds also hampers our ability to report, understand and make use of observed associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to develop a system for describing patterns of participatory behaviour in FOBT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs and to identify factors associated with particular behavioural patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Method: A descriptive framework was developed and applied to a data extract of screening invitation outcomes over two rounds of the NBCSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of invitees in each behaviour category was determined and associations between behaviour patterns and demographic and program factors were identified using multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: We considered Re- Participants, Dropouts, Late Entrants and Never Participants to be the most appropriate labels for the four possible observed participatory categories after two invitation rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The screening participation rate of the South Australian cohort of the NBCSP remained stable over two rounds at 51%, with second round Dropouts (10.3%) being balanced by Late Entrants (10.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-Participants comprised 38.7% of invitees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relative to Re-Participants, Dropouts were older, more likely to be female, of lower SES, had changed their place of residence between offers had a positive test result in the first round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late Entrants tended to be in the youngest age band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Specific demographic characteristics are associated with behavioural sub-groups defined by responses to 2 offers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Targeted group-specific strategies could reduce dropout behaviour or encourage those who declined the first invitation to participate in the second round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It will be important to keep first round participants engaged in order to maximise the benefit of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening program </plain></SENT>
