<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among patients undergoing liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> following preoperative chemotherapy treatment, 17 patients who had received preoperative PVE (group A) were compared with 17 matched controls who had no PVE (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perioperative course and long-term mortality were compared between groups A and B and between group A and the entire group of 75 cases with preoperative chemotherapy (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline characteristics for the matched groups A and B were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group C included less major resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was 1600 ml in group A, 1200 ml in group B, and 1000 ml in group C (p &lt; 0.05 vs. group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median postoperative stay was comparable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups (8-9 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Operation time was 542 min in group A and 464 min in group B (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality after 30 days and 1, 2, and 5 years was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Perioperative outcome and long-term survival did not differ when comparing liver resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> preceded by PVE and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone, except for the operation time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study supports the safety of this "aggressive" combination approach in patients in need of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> "downstaging" by chemotherapy and PVE to increase the remnant liver volume </plain></SENT>
