<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong during the period 2 to 28 May 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The survey covered demographics, perceived health status and susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, utilisation of complementary medicine, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The survey was completed by 2004 Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 50 or older (response rate = 66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The uptake rate of a fecal occult blood test and a colonoscopy was 12% and 19% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening behaviour included: male participants, ex-smokers, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or other serious disease, a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, perceived health status fair or poor, regular visits to a doctor to look after health, and utilisation of complementary medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The uptake rate of this study population was low though an increasing trend did appear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heath education and promotion programmes may focus on these identified factors to facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
