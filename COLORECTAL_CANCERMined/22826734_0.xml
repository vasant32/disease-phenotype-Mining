<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is generally a disease of persons older than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Concerning younger patients, controversies still exist regarding features and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed this study to characterise <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young patients (â‰¤ 40 years) as well as to evaluate short-term outcome in comparison with older patients (&gt;40 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and histopathological parameters of 40 patients aged 40 years or less were compared with 240 patients aged more than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In young patients, the minority suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027672" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer syndromes</z:e> (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, up to 87% of young patients denied any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with older patients, young patients had more mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (32.5% vs. 11.5%; p=0.02), more venous invasion (p=0.021), more perineural invasion (p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For grading (p=0.42), lymphatic invasion (p=0.17) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sites (p=0.46), no significant differences between young and older patients were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young patients had less post operative morbidity (p=0.039), less post operative mortality (0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Young and older patients had the same overall 1-year survival rates (p=0.24), and the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related 1-year survival rates (p=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tunisian patients present with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at a more advanced stage of the disease at younger ages compared to developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> followed by a sufficient oncologic treatment is crucial regardless of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is mandatory for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with suspicious symptoms to undergo early adequate diagnoses </plain></SENT>
