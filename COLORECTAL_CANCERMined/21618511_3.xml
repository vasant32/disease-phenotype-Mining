<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to explore the utility for staging and prognostic impact of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), guanylyl cyclase C (GCC), CUB (complement protein subcomponents C1r/C1s, urchin embryonic growth factor, and bone morphogenic protein 1) containing domain protein 1 (CDCP1) and mucin 2 (MUC2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in mesenteric lymph nodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes were collected at surgery and bisected; one half was subjected to biomarker <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> analysis using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and the other half to routine histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes from 174 CRC patients and 24 controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 59 (range 17-131) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cut-off levels were defined by analyzing quintiles by Cox regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed the best discriminating power between patients with recurrence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> after surgery and patients who were apparently disease-free (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrence for the CEA(+) patients was 4.6 times greater than for the CEA(-) patients (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other biomarkers gave lower hazard ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative survival analysis demonstrated that the average survival time was 99 months for CEA(-) patients compared to 39 months for CEA(+) patients, a difference of 60 months (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six to nine percent of the Stage I and Stage II patients [H&amp;E(-)] had CEA(+), CK20(+), GCC(+) and/or MUC2(+) lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients died from recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low lymph node MUC2/CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> ratio identified patients with high risk for recurrence (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of CEA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is a sensitive method to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in lymph nodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and, in combination with MUC2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, allows improved prediction of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
