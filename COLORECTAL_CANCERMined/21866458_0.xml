<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Bmi1 protein level in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimen and associated clinicopathological parameters, and to determine the influence of Bmi1 on the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bmi1 protein level was assessed in 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SW480 cells were transfected with Bmi siRNA plasmid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and flow cytometry were used to measure the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bmi1 and Bcl-2 were measured by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The positive rate of Bmi1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues was 56.5%(48/85), significantly higher than that in the adjacent noncancerous tissues[17.6%(15/85), P&lt;0.05)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that the overexpression of Bmi1 was associated with degree of differentiation, status of lymph nodes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and TNM staging in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>(P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After transfection of SW480 with Bmi1 siRNA, the cell proliferation was inhibited and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cell proliferation inhibitory rates were 13.1%, 16.5%, and 18.3% at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after transfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic rates were 15.7%, 45.6%, 40.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression of Bmi1 was downregulated after 48 h, as was that of Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bmi1 expression is associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Blockade of Bmi1 can inhibit the proliferation and accelerate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
