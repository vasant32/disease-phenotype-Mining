<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the use of bevacizumab in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected stage III or high-risk stage II colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients from 330 centres in 34 countries were enrolled into this phase 3, open-label randomised trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with curatively resected stage III or high-risk stage II colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive FOLFOX4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2), leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus plus 600 mg/m(2) 22-h continuous infusion on day 1; leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) plus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus plus 600 mg/m(2) 22-h continuous infusion on day 2) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles; bevacizumab 5 mg/kg plus FOLFOX4 (every 2 weeks for 12 cycles) followed by bevacizumab monotherapy 7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (eight cycles over 24 weeks); or bevacizumab 7·5 mg/kg plus XELOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 2 weeks plus oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-15) every 3 weeks for eight cycles followed by bevacizumab monotherapy 7·5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (eight cycles over 24 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Block randomisation was done with a central interactive computerised system, stratified by geographic region and disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery with curative intent occurred 4-8 weeks before randomisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> randomised patients with stage III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00112918 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Of the total intention-to-treat population (n=3451), 2867 patients had stage III disease, of whom 955 were randomly assigned to receive FOLFOX4, 960 to receive bevacizumab-FOLFOX4, and 952 to receive bevacizumab-XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 48 months (range 0-66 months), 237 patients (25%) in the FOLFOX4 group, 280 (29%) in the bevacizumab-FOLFOX4 group, and 253 (27%) in the bevacizumab-XELOX group had relapsed, developed a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival hazard ratio for bevacizumab-FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 was 1·17 (95% CI 0·98-1·39; p=0·07), and for bevacizumab-XELOX versus FOLFOX4 was 1·07 (0·90-1·28; p=0·44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After a minimum follow-up of 60 months, the overall survival hazard ratio for bevacizumab-FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 was 1·27 (1·03-1·57; p=0·02), and for bevacizumab-XELOX versus FOLFOX4 was 1·15 (0·93-1·42; p=0·21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 573 patients with high-risk stage II <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> were included in the safety analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 3-5 adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (FOLFOX4: 477 [42%] of 1126 patients, bevacizumab-FOLFOX4: 416 [36%] of 1145 patients, and bevacizumab-XELOX: 74 [7%] of 1135 patients), diarrhoea (110 [10%], 135 [12%], and 181 [16%], respectively), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (12 [1%], 122 [11%], and 116 [10%], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events were more common in the bevacizumab groups (bevacizumab-FOLFOX4: 297 [26%]; bevacizumab-XELOX: 284 [25%]) than in the FOLFOX4 group (226 [20%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were reported in one patient receiving FOLFOX4, two receiving bevacizumab-FOLFOX4, and five receiving bevacizumab-XELOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Bevacizumab does not prolong disease-free survival when added to adjuvant chemotherapy in resected stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall survival data suggest a potential detrimental effect with bevacizumab plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based adjuvant therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these and other data, we do not recommend the use of bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of patients with curatively resected stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
