<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to determine the optimal cotargeting strategy of the commonly mutated PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras pathways by a selective <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference approach in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines possessing coexistent PIK3CA and KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines HCT116 and DLD-1 were treated with a panel of small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> directed against the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras pathways; proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and protein expression were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> was then evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PIK3CA and KRAS small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were most effective as single treatments; combined treatments with PIK3CA and KRAS small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Either KRAS small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> alone or combined PIK3CA and KRAS small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> treatments <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in HCT116 cells but not in the DLD-1 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> treatment combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> further inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined PIK3CA and KRAS small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> treatments offer an effective therapy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with coexisting mutations in both pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation correlates with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and may provide a biomarker indicative of treatment success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> directed to PIK3CA and KRAS may be used to enhance the effects of current chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
