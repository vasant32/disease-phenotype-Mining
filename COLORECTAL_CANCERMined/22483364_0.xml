<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the chemopreventive effects of different oils on rats were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty Wistar rats received 1,2-dimetilhidrazine (DMH) and were divided into 4 groups fed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> diets to which 4% olive, fish, flaxseed, or soybean oils (control) were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group fed with fish oil presented higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (<z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36005">docosahexaenoic acid</z:chebi> in hepatic tissue and greater levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25048,27432">linolenic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> in adipose tissue compared to the other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the proximal portion of the colon, lower levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> were found in the fish and flaxseed oil groups; however, this behavior was not observed in the middle and distal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Via a benchmarking method, the fish oil group showed a greater transforming growth factor Î² expression and lower interleukin-8 expression in relation to the other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fish oil in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> diet demonstrated a limited protective effect on the colonic precancerous mucosa in carcinogen-treated rodents, whereas it had a beneficial effect on inflammatory modulation </plain></SENT>
