<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Organ transplant recipients have an increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Race differences in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> are observed among the general population, but de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> after adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) have not been compared with those from a Japanese population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were 360 adult LDLT recipients who survived more than 1 year after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An annual medical checkup and screening examinations were performed as follows: abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and total colonoscopy and immunochemical fecal occult blood test every 1 to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete blood count, liver function tests, and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers were checked every 1 to 3 months after LDLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow-up period was 7.5Â±3.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 27 de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were diagnosed in 26 recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> was the most commonly detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality of the recipients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was similar to the findings of the Japanese general population-based study (standardized mortality ratio=0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was significantly higher in transplant recipients than in the Japanese general population (standardized incidence ratio=1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated survival rate of recipients with de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 81% and those of recipients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> was 93% (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> predominated in Japanese liver transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> correlated with a poor prognosis, the standardized mortality ratio was 0.9 compared with that of subjects of a Japanese population-based study </plain></SENT>
