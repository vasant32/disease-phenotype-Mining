<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Meta-analysis of survival data from population based, randomized controlled trials comparing populations screened and not screened for breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trials were identified as high quality by reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration and United States Preventive Services Task Force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Trials undertaken in the United States, Denmark, United Kingdom, and Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>POPULATION: Screened patients older than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in screened and control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Fecal occult blood testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, mammography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our study included five and four eligible trials of breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening, 3.0 years (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 6.3) passed before one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was prevented for every 5000 women screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On average across included studies, it took 10.7 years (4.4 to 21.6) before one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was prevented for 1000 women screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, 4.8 years (2.0 to 9.7) passed before one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was prevented for 5000 patients screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On average across included studies, it took 10.3 years (6.0 to 16.4) before one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was prevented for 1000 patients screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that screening for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is most appropriate for patients with a life expectancy greater than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Incorporating time lag estimates into screening guidelines would encourage a more explicit consideration of the risks and benefits of screening for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
