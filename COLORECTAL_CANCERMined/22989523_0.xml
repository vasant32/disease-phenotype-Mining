<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of this deregulation are not totally clarified, even if genetics and epigenetics are frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variation in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A SNP into miRNA gene might affect the transcription of primary miRNA, its processing and miRNA-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distribution of sequence variants of miR-146a, miR-196a2, miR-499 and miR-149 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and their effect on miRNA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each variant was identified with HRM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For miR-499 we demonstrated a significant reduction of its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> connected to a specific genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the epigenetic effects on miRNA genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we investigated the influence of DNA methylation on miR-34b, miR-34c and miR-9-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We aimed to verify the relationship between the methylation status of these miRNA genes and their relative expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For the quantification of DNA methylation we adopted a method based on Differential High Resolution Melting (D-HRM) </plain></SENT>
