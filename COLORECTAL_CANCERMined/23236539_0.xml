<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tried to increase detection sensitivity, and compared the high-sensitivity EGFR immunostaining with a worldwide standard, EGFR PharmDx™ (Dako) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to pursue high-sensitivity EGFR detection, deparaffinized sections were pressure-cooked in 1 mM EDTA solution, pH 8.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two mouse monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, clone EGFR2.5 and DAK-H1-WT, and six kinds of secondary detection reagents, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-free catalyzed signal amplification (CSA II), Simple Stain MAX-PO, PolyVue, Novolink, EnVision™ FLEX+, and MACH3, were evaluated to compare the results with those with EGFR PharmDx™, employing a combination of 2-18-C9 as the primary monoclonal antibody and EnVision™ as the secondary reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we replaced EnVision™ in the EGFR PharmDx™ kit with CSAII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGFR detection sensitivity was higher with DAK-H1-WT than with EGFR2.5, and among the secondary reagents, the strongest signals were observed with Novolink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> showed distinct expression of EGFR with our high-sensitivity EGFR immunostaining, while only 16 (53%) gave focal positivity with EGFR PharmDx™ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When EnVision™ in EGFR PharmDx™ was replaced by CSA II, strong signals were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and the expression pattern was comparable with our sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-neoplastic crypt epithelial cells often showed weakly signal with the standard EGFR PharmDx™, but consistently revealed strong membrane staining in the two high-sensitivity sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>EGFR PharmDx™ frequently gave false negativity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Importantly, EGFR was consistently and sensitively detected when the secondary polymer in the EGFR PharmDx™ kit was simply replaced by CSA II </plain></SENT>
