<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAMs were prepared using Assam Bora rice <z:chebi fb="99" ids="28017">starch</z:chebi>, a natural mucoadhesive polymer, by a double emulsion solvent evaporation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microspheres were characterized for their shape, size, surface <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, size distribution, incorporation efficiency, and in vitro and in vivo drug release studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The release study confirmed the insignificant release of 5-FU in physiological condition of stomach and small intestine and major drug release in the cecal content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo release study of the optimized MAMs was compared with immediate release (IR) 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-FU was distributed predominantly in the upper GI tract from the IR, whereas 5-FU was distributed primarily to the lower part of the GI tract from the MAM formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enhanced levels of liver enzymes were found in animals given IR 5-FU as well as augmented levels of serum albumin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, leucocytopenia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus to sum up, it can be appropriately established that the 5-FU release pattern from MAMs exhibits slow and extended release over longer periods of time with reduced systemic side effects </plain></SENT>
