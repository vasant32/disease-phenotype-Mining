<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The frequency of referral to colonoscopy based on a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> size threshold of 6 mm was 14.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was found in 9.3% of patients, with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Potentially important extracolonic findings were observed in 2.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low rates of referral to colonoscopy, prevalence of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, and prevalence of extracolonic findings make CTC a viable option for Medicare-aged patients </plain></SENT>
