<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Determination of the profile of genes that are commonly methylated aberrantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) will have substantial value for diagnostic and therapeutic applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is limited knowledge of the DNA methylation pattern in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the methylation profile of 27,578 CpG sites spanning more than 14,000 genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in the adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa with bead-chip array-based technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 621 CpG sites located in promoter regions and CpG islands that were greatly hypermethylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genes on chromosome 18 showed promoter hypermethylation most frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to gene ontology analysis, the most common biologically relevant class of genes affected by methylation was the class associated with the cadherin signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to the genome-wide expression array, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was more likely to be downregulated in the genes demonstrating promoter hypermethylation, even though this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We validated ten CpG sites that were hypermethylated (ADHFE1, BOLL, SLC6A15, ADAMTS5, TFPI2, EYA4, NPY, TWIST1, LAMA1, GAS7) and 2 CpG sites showing hypomethylation (MAEL, SFT2D3) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa in the array studies using pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The methylation status measured by pyrosequencing was consistent with the methylation array data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Methylation profiling based on bead-chip arrays is an effective method for screening aberrantly methylated genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified novel methylated genes that are candidate diagnostic or prognostic markers for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
