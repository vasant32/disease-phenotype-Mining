<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Underutilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening has been found especially to affect socially marginalized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated sexual orientation group patterns in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, sexual orientation, and sociodemographics were gathered prospectively from 1989 through 2005 from 85,759 U.S. women in the Nurses' Health Study II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Publicly available data on state-level healthcare quality and sexual-orientation-related legal protections were also gathered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable models were used to estimate sexual orientation group differences in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, controlling for sociodemographics and state-level healthcare quality and legal protections for sexual minorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Receipt of a mammogram in the past 2 years was common though not universal and differed only slightly by sexual orientation: heterosexual 84 %, bisexual 79 %, and lesbian 82 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fewer than half of eligible women had ever received a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and rates did not differ by sexual orientation: heterosexual 39 %, bisexual 39 %, and lesbian 42 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted models, state-level healthcare quality score, though not state-level legal protections for sexual minorities, was positively associated with likelihood of being screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women regardless of sexual orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Concerns have been raised that unequal healthcare access for sexual orientation minorities may adversely affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found small disparities in mammography and none in colorectal screening, though adherence to colorectal screening recommendations was uniformly very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interventions are needed to increase screening in women of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sexual orientation groups, particularly in areas with poor healthcare policies </plain></SENT>
