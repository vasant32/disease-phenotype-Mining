<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case records of 201 patients with ICRC between January 2000 and December 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) score, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, histology, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, treatment options and median survival were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into four groups according to the treatment modalities: resection alone, resection with post-operative chemotherapy, non-resection treatment by chemotherapy alone, and stent or bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median survival times were compared according to each treatment option, and the survival rates were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 105 patients underwent palliative resection whereas 96 were treated with non-resection modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A palliative resection was performed in 44 cases for resection alone and in 61 cases for resection with post-operative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients treated with non-resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e>, chemotherapy alone was done in 65 cases and stent or bypass in 31 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed a median survival of 14 months in patients with palliative resections with post-operative chemotherapy, which was significantly higher than those for chemotherapy alone (8 months), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection alone (5 months), and stent or bypass (5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gender, age, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> score, CEA level, the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, histology and the presence of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were not independent factors in association with the median survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the treatment of ICRC, palliative resection followed by post-operative chemotherapy shows the most favorable median survival compared to other treatment options </plain></SENT>
