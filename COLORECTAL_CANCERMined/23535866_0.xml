<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: There is evidence indicating that the trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence rates in the United States differ according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subsites, including for ascending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> which has shown a different pattern from the overall trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the time trends for ascending and descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in the United States by race and gender to identify the specific components that may account for the incidence trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for 1973-2008, we conducted age-period-cohort modeling to evaluate birth cohort patterns and evaluate age-period-cohort effects on incidence trends of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A clear birth cohort pattern was observed for both ascending and descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and the incidence rates of ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in the more recent birth cohorts were higher compared to earlier cohorts particularly for black males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This increase was most obvious in the younger age groups and appeared to accelerate, especially for black females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, the study suggested an increase in the birth cohort slope in the later birth cohorts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gender and race groups, after a period of decline in earlier birth cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increase in incidence rates of both ascending and descending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in more recent birth cohorts for blacks suggests the need for targeted public health strategies to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, additional etiological studies are warranted to evaluate factors responsible for the observed trends in more recent birth cohorts, including differences by subsites, race, and/or gender </plain></SENT>
