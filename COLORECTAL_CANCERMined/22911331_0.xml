<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean sojourn time (MST) is an important factor in determining appropriate screening intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Available estimates of MST for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are imprecise and are associated with the older Hemoccult II test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This article presents MST estimates associated with the newer Hemoccult SENSA test and describes differences in MST by the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the colorectum and age at the time of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MST was estimated from a cohort of 42,079 patients who underwent Hemoccult SENSA between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The precision of MST estimates was improved by incorporating information from a meta-analysis of the sensitivity of Hemoccult SENSA into the analytic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Estimated MST for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the proximal and distal colorectum, with 95% credible intervals (CrI) in years, were: 3.86 (1.55-6.91) and 3.35 (2.11-4.93) among 45- to 54-year olds; 3.78 (2.18-5.77) and 2.24 (1.48-3.17) among 55- to 64-year olds; and 2.70 (1.41-4.31) and 2.10 (1.34-3.04) among 65- to 74-year olds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MST associated with Hemoccult SENSA was longer for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the proximal versus distal colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found no evidence that MST increases with age and some evidence that it may decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: These results add new information about the natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and information about the performance of Hemoccult SENSA </plain></SENT>
