<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to carry out a meta-analysis to investigate this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed this association with categorical and dose-response meta-analysis of data from prospective cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relevant studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and OVID for studies published before 9 June 2012, with no restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the highest versus lowest and dose-response association were estimated using random-effects models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> and publication bias was investigated, and subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 333 510 participants with 7435 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> from seven prospective cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The summary RR for the highest versus the lowest intake of dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70-0.92) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.58-1.06) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For men and women, the pooled RR was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.51-1.01) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68-0.94), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant inverse associations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> emerged in nonlinear models (p nonlinearity=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The greatest risk reduction was observed when dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake increased from very low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dietary <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake has a statistically significant nonlinear inverse association with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The greatest reduction for <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> intake is 200-270 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Whether the association is causal or because of confounding warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
