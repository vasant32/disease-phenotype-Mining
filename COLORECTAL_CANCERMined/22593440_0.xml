<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: While efficient surgical treatment is the key to prolonged survival of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, post-surgical follow-up is important for the early detection of relapsing disease or of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current dispensarization, typically based on imaging CT, PET, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, is frequently supported by the observation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers (CEA, CA19-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to their limited sensitivity and selectivity, better tools for monitoring of the disease are desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been recently demonstrated as a new promising molecular marker for observation and early detection of disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present results of post-surgical monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cfDNA in the cases of seven patients suffering from advanced forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied a mutation-based approach in which the total cfDNA was screened for a specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We screened a panel of the most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> covering the genes APC, KRAS, TP53, PIK3CA and BRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were tested positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cfDNA prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>cfDNA was then evaluated within a week after surgery and subsequently in monthly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We present typical cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who underwent surgical treatment at different levels of radicality with or without adjuvant chemo/biotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cfDNA status was found to be always closely correlated with the actual clinical status of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cfDNA appears to be a viable tool for the monitoring of the clinical progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in patients with cfDNA positivity prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
