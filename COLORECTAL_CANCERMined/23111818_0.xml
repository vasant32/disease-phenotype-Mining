<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90 radioembolisation (Y90-RE) is recommended for unresectable, chemorefractory liver-dominant disease; however, the incidence of extrahepatic disease (EHD) is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FDG-PET may have additional value to CT in demonstrating EHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the added diagnostic value of FDG-PET to abdominal CT and study the influence of FDG-PET findings on treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRCLM) referred for Y90-RE were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent both CT and FDG-PET in the diagnostic workup were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging reports were scrutinised for documented sites of EHD, and changes of management due to FDG-PET findings were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings on CT and FDG-PET matched in 20 patients (no EHD, n = 15; identical EHD, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, lesions detected on CT were not FDG-<z:chebi fb="156" ids="39214">avid</z:chebi>, and in 18 patients, FDG-PET showed more lesions than CT (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 7/42 patients (17 %) a change of management was made based on the additional FDG-PET findings, i.e. exclusion from Y90-RE treatment (n = 6) and change in treatment plan (whole liver rather than segmental treatment, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRCLM referred for Y90-RE, FDG-PET showed significantly more EHD and led to a considerable change of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KEY POINTS : • <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">Yttrium</z:chebi>-90 radioembolisation is a locoregional treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver tumours</z:e> • Detection of extrahepatic lesions, for which CT is widely used, is crucial • FDG-PET shows significantly more extrahepatic lesions compared to CT • FDG-PET findings led to a considerable change in treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
