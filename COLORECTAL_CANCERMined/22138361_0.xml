<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, a pilot study was performed to examine the effect of the oral administration of yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain on the cell numbers of fecal ETBF in a healthy population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 420 healthy adults, 38 subjects were found to be ETBF carriers, giving a prevalence of approximately 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 32 subjects were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel-group study to ingest yogurt supplemented with a probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium longum BB536 (BB536Y group), for 8 weeks, with milk provided to the control group (milk group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell numbers of ETBF and the dominant species of the B. fragilis group were measured by a quantitative PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the baseline values, there was a significant decrease in the cell number of ETBF at week 8 in the BB536Y group but not in the milk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear mixed models analysis for longitudinal data revealed a significant difference in the changes of ETBF cell number between the two groups during the intervention phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results imply the potential of probiotic yogurt for eliminating ETBF in the microbiota, but its clinical significance needs to be evaluated in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a possible effect of probiotic intake on ETBF in the microbiota </plain></SENT>
