<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2003 and 2009, 41 patients with 50 lesions confined to one organ from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and treated with high dose SBRT ≥45 Gy were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e>) (18 patients) were the most frequent sites followed in order by lung (12) and liver (11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBRT doses ranged from 45 to 60 Gy in three fractions (median 48 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative gross <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume (GTV) ranged from 2 to 123 ml (median 13 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period from the SBRT date was 28 months (range, 6-65 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 64 and 60%, and the respective 5-year rates were 57 and 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cumulative GTV and SBRT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for local control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grade 3 or 4 complications occurred in three patients (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High dose SBRT for colorectal oligometastases was found to produce results comparable with surgical series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To improve local control, dose higher than 48 Gy are recommend when possible, but further study will be required to define the optimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue constraints and acceptable toxicity </plain></SENT>
