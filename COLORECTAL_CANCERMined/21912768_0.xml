<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anastomotic dehiscence is one of the most severe complications of colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of anastomotic dehiscence following colorectal surgery is important for the reduction of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Based on the close relationship between surgical stress and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, the present study aimed to determine whether a correlation exists between increased levels of reactive oxygen species and colorectal anastomotic dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were divided into three groups: patients with anastomotic dehiscence (group 1); patients without dehiscence who underwent neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (group 2); and patients without anastomotic dehiscence who did not undergo neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to measure nuclear DNA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) content, and possible oxidative damage to nonmalignant colon and rectal tissues adjacent to the anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: mtDNA content was reduced in the colon tissue of patients in groups 1 and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rectal mtDNA was found to be more damaged than colonic mtDNAs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4977 bp common deletion was observed in the mtDNA of tissues from both the colon and rectum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Patients in groups 1 and 2 were more similar to one another than to group 3, probably due to higher levels of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria; the greater damage found in the rectum suggests that dehiscence originates primarily from the rectal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study of mtDNA analyses of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human colon and rectal tissues from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is among the first of its kind </plain></SENT>
