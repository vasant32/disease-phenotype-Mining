<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is the gold-standard test for investigation of symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is an alternative, less invasive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, additional investigation after CTC is needed to confirm suspected colonic lesions, and this is an important factor in establishing the feasibility of CTC as an alternative to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to compare rates of additional colonic investigation after CTC or colonoscopy for detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or large (â‰¥10 mm) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in symptomatic patients in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This pragmatic multicentre randomised trial recruited patients with symptoms suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from 21 UK hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were aged 55 years or older and regarded by their referring clinician as suitable for colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to colonoscopy or CTC by computer-generated random numbers, in blocks of six, stratified by trial centre and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analysed the primary outcome-the rate of additional colonic investigation-by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The trial is an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number 95152621 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 1610 patients were randomly assigned to receive either colonoscopy (n=1072) or CTC (n=538) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>30 patients withdrew consent, leaving for analysis 1047 assigned to colonoscopy and 533 assigned to CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>160 (30.0%) patients in the CTC group had additional colonic investigation compared with 86 (8.2%) in the colonoscopy group (relative risk 3.65, 95% CI 2.87-4.65; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Almost half the referrals after CTC were for small (&lt;10 mm) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or clinical uncertainty, with low predictive value for large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Detection rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> or large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the trial cohort were 11% for both procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CTC missed 1 of 29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and colonoscopy missed none (of 55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Guidelines are needed to reduce the referral rate after CTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For most patients, however, CTC provides a similarly sensitive, less invasive alternative to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>FUNDING: NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme, NIHR Biomedical Research Centres funding scheme, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research UK, EPSRC Multidisciplinary Assessment of Technology Centre for Healthcare, and NIHR Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care </plain></SENT>
