<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, a specific Lactobacillus, strain L. paracasei IMPC2.1, was demonstrated to colonize the human gut and positively affect fecal bacteria and biochemical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of L. paracasei IMPC2.1, comparing them with those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (L.GG), either as viable or heat-killed cells, on cell proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (HGC-27) and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line (DLD-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the gastric and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were sensitive to the growth inhibition and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction by both viable or heat-killed cells from L. paracasei IMPC2.1 and L.GG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the possibility for a food supplement, based on dead probiotics, including L. paracasei IMPC2.1 cells, which could represent an effective component of a functional food strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> growth inhibition, with potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
