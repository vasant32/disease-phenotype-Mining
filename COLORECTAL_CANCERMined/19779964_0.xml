<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is aim to investigate the expression and role of AKAP13 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated 94 pair-matched human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, as well as 36 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, of which <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of AKAP13 was detected by relative Quantitative-Real-Time RT-PCR and protein expression by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AKAP13 gene was upregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> group by 2.259 times compared to control group without significant difference (P = 0.081), and no expression was detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive expression rate of AKAP13 protein in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (52.3%) was significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (9.1%) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue (34.7%) (P = 0.006) by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Either the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein expressions of AKAP13 were correlated with histological types and differentiation grade (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest AKAP13 protein may be related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more deeply and larger scale research are required to prove the correlation </plain></SENT>
