<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the last decade, the number of new agents, including monoclonal antibodies, being developed to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) increased rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While improving outcomes, these new treatments also have distinct and known safety profiles with toxicities that may require hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, patterns and costs of hospitalizations of toxicities of these new 'targeted' drugs are often unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the costs of hospital events associated with adverse events specified in the 'Special Warnings and Precautions for Use' section of the European Medicinal Agency Summary of Product Characteristics for bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the PHARMO Record Linkage System (RLS), patients with a primary or secondary hospital discharge code for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> between 2000-2008 were selected and defined as patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first discharge diagnosis defining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> served as the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed from index date until end of data collection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or end of study period, whichever occurred first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospital events during follow-up were identified through primary hospital discharge codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main outcomes for each event were length of stay and costs per hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 2964 mCRC patients, 271 hospital events occurred in 210 patients (mean [SD] duration of follow-up: 34 [31] months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The longest mean (SD) length of stay per hospital admission were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (16 [33] days), arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (ATE) (14 [21] days), wound-healing complications (WHC), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 days; SD 5-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Highest mean (SD) costs per admission were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (€13,500 [€28,800]), ATE (€13,300 [€18,800]), WHC (€10,800 [€20,500]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Although no causal link could be identified between any specific event and any specific treatment, data from this study are valuable for pharmacoeconomic evaluations of newer treatments in mCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient costs for events in mCRC patients are considerable and vary greatly </plain></SENT>
