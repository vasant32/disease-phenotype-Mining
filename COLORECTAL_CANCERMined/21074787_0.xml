<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in young adults is rising, and young age is a predictor of poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine factors leading to increased mortality in patients ≤ 50 years of age, and to examine this population for characteristics that could lead to benefit from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of patients 50 years of age and under, diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from 1998 through 2007, at our community teaching hospital, were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, social and family history, staging, treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mann Whitney, Fisher Exact, and χ(2) tests were used with P &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were female and 20 male; the mean age was 43.6 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> had a higher presenting stage (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men had both a higher presenting stage (P = 0.35) and a higher incidence of smoking compared with women (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female patients were more likely to have left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (65%) compared with men (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six percent of patients underwent surgical resection; 14 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young adults is not common, but is often advanced when discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic efforts should be aggressive in young patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo>, especially young male smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sigmoidoscopy is not adequate for comprehensive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young patients, as the majority have right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo>, which often result in subsequent presentation of the disease at a higher stage, risk, and mortality rate </plain></SENT>
