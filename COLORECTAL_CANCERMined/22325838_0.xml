<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Bevacizumab, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi>-based therapy, has been shown to prolong survival among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC), at a relatively high cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of therapy for mCRC in the eras prior to, and following, the introduction of bevacizumab on a population basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with newly-diagnosed mCRC in 2003/2004 (the pre-bevacizumab era) and 2006 (the post-bevacizumab era) referred to the British Columbia <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Agency were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cost-utility/cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using 'real-world' data and a Markov approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Costs were estimated from provincial pharmacy and radiation databases, as well as national inpatient, day-surgery and ambulatory care data sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) and life year gained (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) ratios were calculated, and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median overall survival improved from 15.6 to 19.5 months (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients in the post-bevacizumab era there was a gain of an average of 0.06 QALYs or 0.325 LYG at a cost increase of $3791 per patient, resulting in a incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $62,469/QALY or $15,617/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improved to $43,058/QALY or $10,764/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> when the analysis was restricted to patients potentially eligible for bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were generally robust to changes in model parameters, but were sensitive to the costs of chemotherapy and to differential utilities used in the Markov model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of bevacizumab was associated with increased costs, but cost-effectiveness estimates were in-line with those reported for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies </plain></SENT>
