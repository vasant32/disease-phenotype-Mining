<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant retrospective study had institutional review board approval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The requirement for patient informed consent was waived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in 208 patients was measured on portal venous phase multidetector CT images by using a single ROI, the average measurement in three ROIs on a single section, and with semiautomated segmentation of the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume (volumetric attenuation) to evaluate intermethod agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility were evaluated in the first 70 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Measurements were repeated after 30 days to assess intraobserver reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences between methods were tested by using repeated-measures analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intermethod, intraobserver, and interobserver agreements were tested by using Bland-Altman analysis and the Lin concordance correlation coefficient (ρc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P &lt; .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 208 pathologically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> larger than 20 mm in diameter in 100 women and 108 men (mean age, 61.6 years ± 11.6 [standard deviation]; range, 28-87 years) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Attenuation was significantly different between the three methods of measurement (P &lt; .001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measurements had better intraobserver agreement (precision = 3.3%, ρc = 0.996, P &lt; .001) than single-ROI measurements (precision = 12.0%, ρc = 0.947, P &lt; .001) and measurements averaged over three ROIs (precision = 9.3%, ρc = 0.965, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measurements also had better interobserver agreement (precision = 3.6%, ρc = 0.993, P &lt; .001) than single-ROI measurements (precision = 11.3%, ρc = 0.957, P &lt; .001) and the average measurement in three ROIs (precision = 8.5%, ρc = 0.976, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurements of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumor</z:mpath> attenuation at multidetector CT are reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An approach based on the evaluation of whole-lesion attenuation demonstrated better reproducibility than ROI measurements </plain></SENT>
