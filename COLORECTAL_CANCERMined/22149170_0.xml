<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various mammalian cells including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells secrete extracellular vesicles (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e>), otherwise known as exosomes and microvesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e> are nanosized bilayered proteolipids and play multiple roles in intercellular communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although many vesicular proteins have been identified, their functional interrelationships and the mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> biogenesis remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By interrogating proteomic data using systems approaches, we have created a protein interaction network of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e> which comprises 1491 interactions between 957 vesicular proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discovered that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e> have well-connected clusters with several hub proteins similar to other subcellular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also experimentally validated that direct protein interactions between cellular proteins may be involved in protein sorting during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, physically and functionally interconnected protein complexes form functional modules involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> biogenesis and functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we discovered that SRC signaling plays a major role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> biogenesis, and confirmed that inhibition of SRC kinase decreased the intracellular biogenesis and cell surface release of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EVs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study provides global insights into the cargo-sorting, biogenesis, and pathophysiological roles of these complex extracellular organelles </plain></SENT>
