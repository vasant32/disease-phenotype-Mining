<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) are estimated to have potential usefulness as a biomarker for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), this remains uncertain because the natural history of ACF has not been well-clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the usefulness of ACF as a surrogate marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, it is necessary to understand the natural history of ACF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 82 subjects who underwent total colonoscopy and whose ACF number was examined at least 2 times at Yokohama City University Hospital were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the changes in the ACF number at four different surveillance periods (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years) and in groups with and without colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we classified the subjects into an increased ACF group and a no change/decreased ACF group, and investigated the relationship between the changes in the ACF number and known risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in the ACF number between the first and second observations in any surveillance period groups, and in the groups classified according to the presence or absence of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the increased and no change/decreased ACF group in terms of gender, smoking habit, current alcohol consumption, age, BMI, HbA1c or serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level (TG), whereas a significant difference between the groups was observed in the serum total cholesterol level (TC) (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACF are a reliable surrogate marker that are not affected by any risk factors for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, except TC, and may therefore be considered as a useful marker in chemopreventive trials </plain></SENT>
