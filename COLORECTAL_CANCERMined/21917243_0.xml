<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To illustrate the computed tomography (CT) appearances and natural history of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">omental infarction</z:e> following colonic resection and to highlight the important clinical implications of this radiological diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 3 year period, 15 patients with a history of colonic resection were identified as having a CT diagnosis of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">omental infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relevant clinical and pathological data were retrospectively collected from the institution's electronic patient records system and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant imaging was reviewed, including serial CT images in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diagnosis of postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">omental infarction</z:e> was made in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who had undergone open or laparoscopic colonic resection for benign or malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT appearances ranged from diffuse omental stranding to discrete masses, which typically appeared within weeks of surgery and could persist for years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four (36%) of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the CT appearances raised concern for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, but percutaneous biopsy and/or serial CT allowed a confident diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">omental infarction</z:e> to be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although most cases were self-limiting, three (20%) cases were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary infection</z:e> and required radiological or surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267783" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">omental infarction</z:e> is an under-recognized complication of colonic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has the potential to mimic recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and may require radiological or surgical intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
