<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Binding specificities of serum antibodies against sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were confirmed as being mono-specific by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> chip re-analysis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-affinity-purified antibody pools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that serum samples from colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients contain antibodies against sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> from the topoisomerase IIa antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interactions of patients' antibodies with sequential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> displayed by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> on glass surfaces may thus mirror disease-specific immune situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consequently, these data suggest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-antibody reactivities on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> chips as potential diagnostic readouts of individual immune response characteristics, especially because monospecific antibodies can be interrogated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the clonality of the antibodies present in the mono-specific antibody pools was characterized by 2D gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggested that the affinity-purified antibodies were oligoclonal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly to large-scale screening approaches for specific antigen-antibody interactions in order to improve disease diagnostic, we suggest that "protein-wide" screening for specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-paratope interactions may help to develop novel assays for monitoring of personalized therapies, since individual properties of antigen-antibody interactions remain distinguishable </plain></SENT>
