<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to evaluate the associations of this variant with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> phenotype and intratumoral molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 1509 CRC cases and 2307 age-matched controls nested within the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the TaqMan assay to genotype rs4939827 and logistic regression to assess the association of rs4939827 with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> according to different phenotypic and molecular characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the minor allele (G) in rs4939827 (SMAD7, 18q21) was associated with a lower risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage pT1 or pT2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> [multivariate odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.87] but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage pT3 or pT4 (multivariate OR, 1.07; 95% CI 0.93-1.23, P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 1.2 Ã— 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association between rs4939827 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> also significantly differed by methylation of RUNX3 (P for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the minor allele (G) in rs4939827 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (hazards ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that the minor allele (G) of the germline intronic SMAD7 variant rs4939827 is associated with a lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without methylation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor RUNX3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that individuals with this SMAD7 variant that develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are more probably to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with greater invasiveness and methylation of RUNX3, which potentially contributes to their poorer observed survival </plain></SENT>
