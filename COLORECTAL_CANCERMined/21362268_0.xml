<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Large prospective studies are required to establish their relevance to disease prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the relevance of 19 markers in 790 patients enrolled in a large randomised trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> using immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between overall 10-year survival and marker status was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2) and cyclin A were significantly associated with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated MCM2 expression was associated with a better prognosis (HR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.46 - 0.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A expression above the median predicted an improved patient prognosis (HR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53 - 0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For mismatch repair deficiency and transforming growth factor Î² receptor type II (TGFBRII) overexpression there was a borderline association with a poorer prognosis (HR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.46 - 1.04 and HR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.02 - 4.40, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No apparent associations were found for other markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study identified cell proliferation and cyclin A expression as prognostic indicators of patient outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
