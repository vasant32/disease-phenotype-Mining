<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in many of these trials, the reported reductions have been modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Part of the reason is the inappropriate way the reductions have been calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses have largely ignored the fact that there is a time window in the first several years after screening begins in which there cannot be a sizable mortality reduction, followed by one in which the reductions become evident, and-unless screening is continued-a third window in which mortality rates in the screened group revert to those in the unscreened group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review uses time-specific mortality ratios to address the timing and extent of the reductions achieved in trials of screening for prostate, breast, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The author finds that the mortality reductions reported in the literature have substantially underestimated what might be accomplished with continued screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The natural history of the disease, the frequency of screening, and the duration of follow-up determine the time patterns in the reductions observed in trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without appropriate analyses, results from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening trials will be distorted </plain></SENT>
