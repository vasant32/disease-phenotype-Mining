<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actual modeling and simulation of the key biological structures involved in this process is of interest to biologists and physicians and, at the same time, it poses significant challenges from the mathematics and computer science viewpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we give an overview of some mathematical models for cell sorting (a basic phenomenon that underlies several dynamical processes in an organism), intestinal crypt dynamics and related problems and open questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, major attention is devoted to the survey of so-called in-lattice (or grid) models and off-lattice (off-grid) models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current work is the groundwork for future research on semi-automated hypotheses formation and testing about the behavior of the various actors taking part in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> progression, from regulatory processes to cell-cell signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
