<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypothesizing that the medical philanthropy platform may be effective in improving access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS)-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening "health fair" for uninsured patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Uninsured patients older than 50 years who had not undergone <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in the preceding 10 years were recruited through local free clinics and health fairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standard medical clinic was transformed into a fully functional endoscopy unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medicolegal protection for volunteers was obtained through the Florida Department of Health's Volunteer Health Care Provider Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unsedated FS with polypectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Those with high-risk endoscopic features were given instructions on obtaining a full colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients without access to any form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening underwent FS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four percent had an adequate bowel preparation, although 40% required on-site enema </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had a total of 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 4 of which were adenomatous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total cost of the fair, excluding donated resources such as endoscopes and processors, was $6,531.47, amounting to $126 per patient screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Health fair-style <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for uninsured patients is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With improved efficiency, widespread application of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening using the medical philanthropy platform may represent a viable approach to reducing the underuse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening among the uninsured </plain></SENT>
