<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of extrahepatic disease has a significant effect on the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study is to assess the value of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography/computed tomography with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">18F-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT) in the decision making whether to perform RFA or surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients (23 men, 12 women; age range: 46-78 years) with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of them were considered candidates for surgical resection and 16 for RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT, helical computed tomography of the chest and abdomen and, some of them, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT studies were performed within 4 weeks from conventional imaging, and additional findings were later confirmed or not, either by histology or follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the surgical candidate group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT detected extrahepatic disease, missed by conventional imaging, in 9/19 patients (47.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings directly altered the management in 7 patients (36.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the group of RFA candidates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT detected additional extrahepatic disease in 4/16 patients (25%) and directly altered management in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, in 11/35 patients (31.4%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT detected extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-FDG PET/CT provides relevant additional information that has significant impact on management </plain></SENT>
