<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) after BC and the additional risk factor of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> exposure were investigated by several studies with conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-control study aimed at investigating if a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> is a risk factor of developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and establishing whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> exposure is an additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 175 asymptomatic women with a past history of BC and invited them to undergo a screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same period, we enrolled 201 healthy asymptomatic women (HG) with no family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> which were referred to our Unit for a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at colonoscopy was 56.9 years for BC patients vs. 56.3 years for HG (p=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 32/175 (18.3%) BC patients, 38 lesions and in 17/201 (8.4%) controls, 20 lesions (p=0.029) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BC patients had 5/32 CRC vs. no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the HG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of age, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, timing from BC diagnosis and first colonoscopy, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> treatment revealed that none of the variables were predictive of the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the BC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In the present study BC group had a significant higher prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">Tamoxifen</z:chebi> exposure did not increase the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support the hypothesis that BC is a risk condition for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk is small but present and a screening colonoscopy should be offered to these patients </plain></SENT>
