<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> predominantly occurs in the elderly, but approximately 5% of patients are 50 years old or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether young age is prognostic, or whether it influences efficacy/toxicity of chemotherapy, in patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed individual data on 6,284 patients from nine phase III trials of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (aCRC) that used fluorouracil-based single-agent and combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>End points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), and grade 3 or worse adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratified Cox and adjusted logistic-regression models were used to test for age effects and age-treatment interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 793 patients (13%) were younger than 50 years old; 188 of these patients (3% of total patients) were younger than 40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (10% v 7%; P = .01) was more common, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (11% v 14%; P = .001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (23% v 26%; P &lt; .001) were less common in young (younger than 50 years) than in older (older than 50 years) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age was prognostic for PFS, with poorer outcomes occurring in those younger than 50 years (median, 6.0 v 7.5 months; hazard ratio, 1.10; P = .02), but it did not affect RR or OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the subset of monotherapy versus combination chemotherapy trials, the relative benefits of multiagent chemotherapy were similar for young and older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were comparable when utilizing an age cut point of 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Young age is modestly associated with poorer PFS but not OS or RR in treated patients with aCRC, and young patients have more <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> but less <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with chemotherapy in general </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Young versus older patients derive the same benefits from combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Absent results of a clinical trial, standard combination chemotherapy approaches are appropriate for young patients with aCRC </plain></SENT>
