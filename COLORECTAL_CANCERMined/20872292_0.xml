<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The study was designed to investigate the clinicopathological correlations, relationship to apoptotic index, and prognostic significance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was carried out on 40 patients with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' data were collected prospectively and the 2 years overall survival was the endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic body index was calculated by counting apoptotic cells using the modified TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta positivity was detected in 65% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha positivity was found in only 7% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta immunoreactivity was significantly higher in low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median apoptotic index in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta positive cases was significantly higher than in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta negative cases (6% versus 3%; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median overall survival was higher in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta positive cases (22 versus 18 months); however, the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study results reinforce the importance of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta rather than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor alpha in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lack of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta expression is associated with loss of differentiation and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should include validation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta as a prognostic marker and exploration of its role as a target in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
