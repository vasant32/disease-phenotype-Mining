<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Experimental data suggest that mitochondria is involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the qualitative and quantitative changes of mtDNA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted possible correlations of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA (mtDNA) copy number in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) with clinical and pathological findings and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: mtDNA copy numbers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissue and adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses from 60 patients admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined the correlation of mtDNA copy numbers and clinicopathologic parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between mtDNA copy number and three-year survival was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mtDNA copy number was lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue compared with the corresponding non-cancerous colorectal tissue (mean: 108.60 ± 20.11 vs. 153.68 ± 25.72) and was significantly correlated with lymph-node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a lower mtDNA copy number tended to have lower 3-year survival than patients with a higher mtDNA copy number assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves, but the correlation was not significant (overall survival, 63.0 vs 83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a reduced copy number of mtDNA is correlated with malignant potential in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
