<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 patients with 96 hepatic colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> underwent baseline MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axial T(1), T(2) and multi-echo GRASE sequences were acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROIs were drawn on T(2) relaxation maps, obtained from GRASE images, encompassing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver to record T(2) relaxation time values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with 28 metastases, MRI was repeated using same protocol at 6 weeks following chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median pre-treatment T(2) values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver were compared using the Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pre- and post-treatment median T(2) values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were compared using the Wilcoxon-Rank test for responding (n=16) and non-responding (n=12) lesions defined by RECIST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in T(2) values (ΔT(2)) were compared and correlated with percentage change in lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in the pre-treatment median T(2) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> between responding (67.3±8.6) and non-responding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (71.4±16.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the end of chemotherapy, there was a decrease in the median T(2) of responding lesions (61.6±12.6) p=0.83, and increase in non-responding lesions (76.2±18.4) p=0.03, but these were not significantly different from the pre-treatment values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in ΔT(2) of responding and non-responding lesions (p=0.18) and no correlation was seen between size change and ΔT(2) (coefficient=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T(2) relaxation time does not appear to predict response of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
