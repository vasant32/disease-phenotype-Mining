<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequently, only a single model or genetic background is utilized using diets that are not relevant to that consumed by most <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, which may contribute to the lack of predictability of many preclinical therapeutic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was used to investigate potential causes for low predictive values of many preclinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the small molecule EGFR inhibitor AG1478 was evaluated using two mouse models, Apc(Min/+) and azoxymethane (AOM), both sexes on three genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J (A) inbred strains and AB6F1 hybrids, and two diets, standard chow (STD) or Western-style diet (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AG1478 has significant anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activity in the B6-Apc(Min/+) model with STD but only moderately on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> and in the AOM model on an A background with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e> but not STD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the F1 hybrid background AG1478 is effective in the Apc(Min/+) model with either STD or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WD</z:e>, but has only moderate efficacy in the AOM model with either diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sex differences were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the level of liver EGFR phosphorylation inhibition by AG1478 was not positively correlated with inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> in the AOM model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Model-dependent interactions between genetic background and diet can dramatically impact preclinical results, and indicate that low predictive values of preclinical studies can be attributed to study designs that do not account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> patient population or the diets they consume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Better-designed preclinical studies should lead to more accurate predictions of therapeutic response in the clinic </plain></SENT>
