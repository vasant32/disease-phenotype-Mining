<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: More than 1.2 million new cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are reported each year worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite actual screening programs, about 50% of the patients are diagnosed at advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stages presenting poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Innovative screening tools could aid the detection at early stages and allow curative treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nine target multiplex serum protein biochip was generated and evaluated using a training- and validation-set of 317 highly standardized, liquid nitrogen preserved serum samples comprising controls, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of CEA, IL-8, VEGF, S100A11, MCSF, C3adesArg, CD26, and CRP showed significant differences between cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The largest areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were observed for CEA, IL-8, and CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At threshold levels yielding 90% specificity, sensitivities for CEA, IL-8 and CRP were 26%, 22%, and 17%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most promising marker combinations were CEA + IL-8 reaching 37% sensitivity at 83% specificity and CEA + CRP with 35% sensitivity at 81% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an independent validation set CEA + IL-8 reached 47% sensitivity at 86% specificity while CEA + CRP obtained 39% sensitivity at 86% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were detected with 33% sensitivity for CEA + IL-8 and 28% for CEA + CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Apart from CEA, IL-8, and CRP, the screening value of additional blood markers and the potential advantage of combining serum biochip testing with fecal occult blood testing needs to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiplex biochip array technology utilizing serum samples offers an innovative approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
