<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Chemotherapy improves the survival rate of stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, and leucovorin (the FOLFOX4 regimen) has emerged as the standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prospective study evaluates potential alterations in cognitive function in FOLFOX4-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 57 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a complete battery of neuropsychological tests at three different times: before (T0), at the end (T1), and 6 months after treatment (T2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), visuo-spatial memory (Clock Drawing Test, CDT, Rey Complex Figure, copy and recall), information processing speed (Trial Making Test-A, TMT-A, and Trial Making Test-B, TMT-B), verbal memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, call and recall), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Psychological Distress</z:e> Inventory, PDI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> (State and Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory, STAI-Y1 and Y2), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory, BDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then we have calculated, for each test and for each interval of time, mean Â± standard deviation for the mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent phase, we tested the significance of different results through the ANOVA analysis for repeated measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this case, we could not find any statistically significant modification in cognitive function, but we could notice an improvement in emotional performance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> a short time after chemotherapy administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no effect on cognitive function related to chemotherapy, the only little modification is about some emotional performance during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may be explained by the central role of the psychological adaptation process, which occurs during the period from diagnosis to completion of treatment and is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and adjustment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results seem to rule out any significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> due to adjuvant FOLFOX4 chemotherapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
