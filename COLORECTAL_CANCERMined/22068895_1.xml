<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Humanized anti-A33 antibody (10 mg) labeled with the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emitting radionuclide (124)I ((124)I-huA33) was injected intravenously in 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical PET/CT was performed approximately 1 wk later, followed by a detailed assay of surgically removed tissue specimens including radioactivity counting, autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, and antigen density determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PET/CT showed high levels of antibody targeting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In tissue specimens, the spatial distribution of (124)I-huA33 conformed to that of A33 antigen, and there was a linear relationship between the amount of bound antibody and antigen concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibody uptake was high in 1- to 2-mm regions of antigen-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (mean, ~0.05 percentage injected dose per gram) and in antigen-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa (mean, ~0.03 percentage injected dose per gram) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The estimated binding site occupancy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon was 20%-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The in vivo biodistribution of (124)I-huA33 in human patients 1 wk after antibody administration was determined by A33 antigen expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data imply that the optimal strategy for A33-based radioimmunotherapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> will consist of a multistep treatment using a radionuclide with short-range (α- or β-particle) emissions </plain></SENT>
