<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Published data on the association between Cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A gene polymorphism and digestive tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi>) are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a meta-analysis of published case-control studies to derive a more precise estimation of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to February 1st, 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were available from a total of 33 case-control studies with 8534 cases and 11,737 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combined results based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies showed that there was a statistically significant link between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> risk (GG vs. AA: OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.71-0.96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of ethnic groups, we found the A allele carriers had a significantly increased <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> susceptibility among Caucasians, but not among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When stratified for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, the results based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies only showed the variant allele 870A might have a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), especially of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (GG vs. AA: OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.58-0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When stratifying by the stage and histological differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we only observed that patients had a significantly higher frequency of CCND1 870 AA than non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The A allele carriers (hetero- or homozygotes) were significantly more common in cases with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of publication bias for CCND1 G870A polymorphism with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrates that the CCND1 G870A polymorphism may be an ethnicity-dependent risk factor for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="53093">DTC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>And this genetic variant may increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
