<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-hundred and forty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, without other significant co-morbidities predisposing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo>, were divided according to their age into two groups: patients aged between 50 and 68 years (group I, n = 75); and patients aged ≥ 69 years (group II, n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were prospectively monitored at baseline and followed-up during chemotherapy using the motor and neurosensory National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Toxicity criteria, the clinical version of the Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> Score and neurophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and cumulative OXAIPN was thoroughly determined and then compared between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n = 64/75 vs. 56/70; P = 0.510) and cumulative OXAIPN (n = 51/75 vs. 49/70; P = 0.858) between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of OXAIPN was also similar between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In line with the clinical data, the neurophysiological results between age groups were also comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that advanced age does not seem to represent a significant risk factor of OXAIPN in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> without any other significant co-morbidities </plain></SENT>
