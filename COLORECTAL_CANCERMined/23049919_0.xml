<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> localization, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Plasma samples were collected for SEPT9 analysis from patients with no evidence of disease (NED) (n=92) before colonoscopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n=92) before surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-converted using Epi proColon kit 2.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Qualitative determination was performed using Epi proColon 2.0 RT-PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples for gFOBT and CEA analysis were collected from NED (n=17 and 27, respectively) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n=22 and 27, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SEPT9 test was positive in 15.2% (14/92) of NED and 95.6% (88/92) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including 100% (67/67) from stage II to stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 84% (21/25) of stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> when a sample was called positive if 1 out of 3 PCR replicates was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second analysis (2 out of 3 PCR replicates) specificity improved to 99% (91/92) of NEDs, at a sensitivity of 79.3% (73/92) of SEPT9 positives in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>gFOBT was positive in 29.4% (5/17) of NED and 68.2% (15/22) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and elevated CEA levels were detected in 14.8% (4/27) of NED and 51.8% (14/27) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both SEPT9 (84.8%) and CEA (85.2%) showed higher specificity than gFOBT (70.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SEPT9 was positive in 96.4% (54/56) of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (LSCC) cases and 94.4% (34/36) of right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (RSCC) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>gFOBT was positive in 83.3% (10/12) of cases with LSCC and 50% (5/10) of cases with RSCC, elevated CEA was detected 60% (9/15) of LSCC and 41.7% (5/12) of RSCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The high degree of sensitivity and specificity of SEPT9 in plasma makes it a better method to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> than gFOBT and CEA, even for the more difficult to detect RSCC </plain></SENT>
