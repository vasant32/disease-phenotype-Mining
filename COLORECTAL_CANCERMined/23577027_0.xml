<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A shift in the total incidence from left- to right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> has been reported and raises the question as to whether lifestyle risk factors are responsible for the changing subsite distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study provides a review of the subsite-specific risk estimates for the dietary components presently regarded as convincing or probable risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>: red meat, processed meat, fiber, garlic, milk, calcium, and alcohol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were identified by searching PubMed through October 8, 2012 and by reviewing reference lists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two prospective cohort studies are included, and the estimates are compared by sex for each risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For alcohol, there seems to be a stronger association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, and for meat a somewhat stronger association with distal colon and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, relative to proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For fiber, milk, and calcium, there were only minor differences in relative risk across subsites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statement could be given regarding garlic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, many of the subsite-specific risk estimates were nonsignificant, irrespective of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For some dietary components the associations with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the rectum</z:e> and distal colon appear stronger than for proximal colon, but not for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
