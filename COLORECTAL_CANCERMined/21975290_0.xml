<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High rates of extrapancreatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (EPM) have been observed in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (IPMN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IPMN in patients with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the association of IPMN with EPM, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> in family members, and germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data from 82 patients with IPMN and direct contact for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> history, data were compared with those of 150 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (<z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The common germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were evaluated on available IPMN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EPM rates were greater in IPMN than <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp> patients (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignancies</z:e> in first-degree relatives, specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, were more common among IPMN than <z:mp ids='MP_0009151'>PDAC</z:mp> patients (P = .028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IPMN patients with EPM had high rates of relatives with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the 51 genetically tested patients (4%) were BRCA2 mutation carriers, and both had first-degree relatives with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> was microsatellite stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated high rates of EPM among IPMN patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was an increased rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in families of IPMN patients, specifically <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in families of IPMN patients who have EPM was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a genetic component in the pathogenesis of IPMN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Possible genetic changes include BRCA2 mutations, which are found in 25% of IPMN patients with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
