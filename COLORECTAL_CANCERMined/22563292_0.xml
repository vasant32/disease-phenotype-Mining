<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and January 2011, fluoroscopic placement of a dual colorectal stent was attempted in a total of 97 patients with malignant colorectal obstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> guiding sheath was used in patients in whom a stent delivery system failed to reach the obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Usefulness of the sheath was evaluated depending on whether the sheath could successfully assist the stent delivery system reach its area of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The guiding sheath was needed in 22 patients (15 men, 7 women; age range, 33-77 years; mean age, 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall success rate for passing the sheath to the area of interest was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients reported mild discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 of 22 patients with successful passing of the sheath to the area of interest, stent placement failed because of failure in the negotiation of a guide wire through the obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a guiding sheath seems to be easy, safe and useful in fluoroscopic stent placement for patients with malignant colorectal obstructions </plain></SENT>
