<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of SBRT in a cohort of patients treated between 2003 and 2009 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 61 patients with oligometastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> (single pulmonary nodules in 73.7%) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SBRT was performed with a stereotactic body frame and a 3D-conformal technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients received 26 Gy in 1 fraction, 22 a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions and 3 a dose of 36 Gy in 4 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumor</z:e> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in 45.7% of patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 21.3% and a variety of other origins in 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was local control, secondary endpoints were survival and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up interval of 20.4 months, local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 89% and 83.5%, overall survival 66.5% and 52.5%, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival 75.4% and 67%, progression-free survival 32.4% and 22.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> volume was significantly associated to survival, with highest rates in patients with single small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival time was 42.8 months, while median progression-free survival time was 11.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity profiles were good, with just one case of grade III toxicity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that SBRT is an effective and safe local treatment option for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Definitive results are strictly correlated to clinical selection of patients </plain></SENT>
