<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the combination fails to improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the reason for the lack of activity is unknown, our study aims to determine the effect of bevacizumab on targeting of anti-EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibodies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice with subcutaneous EGFR and IGF-1R-expressing SUM149 xenografts received a single dose of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 days, mice were injected with radiolabeled cetuximab or R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group received a radiolabeled irrelevant IgG (hLL2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three days later, SPECT/CT images were acquired and mice were dissected to determine the concentration of antibodies in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine vascular density (CD34), VEGF, EGFR and IGF-1R expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SPECT/CT imaging revealed that bevacizumab treatment significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targeting of radiolabeled cetuximab by 40% from 33.1 ± 1.1 %ID/g to 19.8 ± 5.7 %ID/g (p = 0.009) for untreated and bevacizumab-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was found for (111) In-R1507: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targeting of R1507 decreased by 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake were observed in mice that received an irrelevant IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Uptake in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> organs was not altered by bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis showed that vascular density decreased with 43%, whereas EGFR and IGF-1R expression was unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, bevacizumab treatment significantly reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> targeting of anti-EGFR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the importance of timing and sequencing of bevacizumab in combination with other antibodies </plain></SENT>
