<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332128" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">peritoneal carcinomatosis</z:e> (PC) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients frequently results in a dilemma with regard to the optimal treatment strategy, especially when PC is encountered unexpectedly during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in the presence of synchronous PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous PC in three community hospitals were selected from the Eindhoven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes of postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality and overall survival were collected and analyzed according to the type of intervention performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2009, 169 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were diagnosed with synchronous PC, most of them unexpectedly during surgery (n = 130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>142 patients underwent surgery: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection (n = 91), palliative procedure (n = 46) or exploration only (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-hospital mortality was 41% after palliative surgery and 14% after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 12 weeks after palliative surgery or exploration as opposed to 55 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PC is most often encountered unexpectedly during surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of palliative procedures are very poor with a high in-hospital mortality rate and short survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> can be performed safely with relatively good outcomes but some patients could have benefited from an even more radical approach when the presence of PC would have been diagnosed at an earlier stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improvement of imaging techniques to detect PC prior to surgery is therefore urgently needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Until this is the case, a high index of suspicion is required when subtle signs of PC are encountered </plain></SENT>
