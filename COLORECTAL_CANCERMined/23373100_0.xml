<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity is low, only about 50% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunochemical tests for faecal occult blood are now also available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>Do they improve the performance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To answer this question, we reviewed the available literature using the standard Prescrire methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These immunochemical tests are specific for human <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, are read automatically, and provide quantitative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their sensitivity in detecting lesions, and the proportion of patients who subsequently require colonoscopy, depends on the chosen cutoff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 9 screening studies including a total of about 86 000 participants, immunochemical tests had a sensitivity of between 61% and 89% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, depending on the test modalities and positivity cutoffs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In France, immunochemical tests have been compared with Haemoccult for mass screening in a total of 85 149 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They detected nearly twice as many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> as Haemoccult, but led to twice as many colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both methods detected about 1 cancer per 14 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main risks of screening are those associated with colonoscopy, which results in about 3 serious complications (including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) per 1000 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no studies of screening-related complications in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In practice, immunoassay-based tests appear to increase the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> detected but are associated with a proportionate increase in the number of patients who undergo colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In France, better assessment and supervision of colonoscopies resulting from mass screening are needed </plain></SENT>
