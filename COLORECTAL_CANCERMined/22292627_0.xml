<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The case-control study included 220 recently diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and 220 age and gender matched healthy subjects as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The participating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases had lower dietary intake of fibre, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, Î²-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> as compared to controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables was also lower among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases, while the frequency of consumption of red meat and saturated fat was higher and positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, family history for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> played a positive role and the majority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases and controls had a low physical activity level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fruits and vegetables, and high in animal red meat and saturated fat, appeared associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> among the studied Jordanian subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> studies in developed nations indicating global causal effects for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
