<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, total pelvic exenteration (TPE) may be necessary for curative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite improvements in mortality rates since TPE was first described, morbidity rates remain high due to the extensive resection and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the outcomes of TPE surgery performed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients with various pelvic pathologies underwent TPE between 2004 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on pathology: colorectal (n = 36) versus non-colorectal (n = 17) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics, operative reports, pathology reports, periprocedural events, and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the two groups was performed using student's t-test and Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The colorectal and non-colorectal groups were similar in demographics, operative times, length of stay, estimated blood loss, and rates of preoperative and intraoperative radiation use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy use was increased in the colorectal group compared with the non-colorectal group (55.6% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complication rates were similar: 86% in the colorectal group and 76% in the non-colorectal group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the colorectal group, 27.8% of patients developed perineal abscesses, whereas no patients developed these complications in the non-colorectal group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No survival difference was seen in primary versus recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>; however, within the colorectal group there was a survival advantage when comparing R0 resection to R1 and R2 resection combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median survival rates were 27.3 months for R0 resection and 10.7 months for R1 and R2 resection combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 21.4 months for the colorectal group and 6.9 months for the non-colorectal group (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing TPE for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> have improved survival when compared with patients undergoing exenteration for pelvic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of other origins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Within the colorectal group, the extent of resection demonstrated a significant survival benefit of an R0 resection compared with R1 and R2 resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite TPE carrying a high morbidity rate, mortality rates have improved and careful patient selection can optimize outcomes </plain></SENT>
