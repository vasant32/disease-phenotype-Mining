<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately 40-50% of patients already have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at presentation when prognosis is poor with a 5-year survival of &lt;10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to play a crucial role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now show that higher levels of ROS accumulation are found in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-derived metastatic cell line (SW620) compared with a cell line (SW480) derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> from the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, ROS accumulation can affect both the migratory and invasive capacity of SW480 and SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore the molecular mechanism underlying ROS-induced migration and invasion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we have compared protein expression patterns between SW480 and SW620 cells using a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 63 altered proteins were identified from tandem MS analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis revealed dysregulated expression of multiple redox regulative or ROS responsive proteins, implicating their functional roles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular and pathological validation demonstrated that altered expression of PGAM1, GRB2, DJ-1, ITGB3, SOD-1, and STMN1 was closely correlated with the metastatic potential of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional studies showed that ROS markedly up-regulated expression of ITGB3, which in turn promoted an aggressive phenotype in SW480 cells, with concomitant up-regulated expression of STMN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, knockdown of ITGB3 expression could mitigate the migratory and invasive potential of SW620 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi>-treated SW480 cells, accompanied by down-regulated expression of STMN1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The function of ITGB3 was dependent on the surface expression of integrin αvβ3 heterodimer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, STMN1 expression and the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway were found to be involved in ROS-induced and ITGB3-mediated migration and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies suggest that ITGB3 plays an important role in ROS-induced migration and invasion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
