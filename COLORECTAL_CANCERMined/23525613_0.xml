<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 1,032 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and evaluated CLR by counting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> peritumoral lymphoid aggregates (LAs) and by measuring the maximum diameter of the largest LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The maximum diameter of the largest LA, rather than the number, had a significant impact on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active CLR determined by the 1-mm rule was significantly associated with MLH1/MSH2 immunohistochemical staining deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group with LAs 1 mm or larger had lower recurrence (P = .0008) and a higher survival rate (P &lt; .0001) than that without LAs 1 mm or larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were similarly observed in another cohort of 500 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The k values for CLR evaluation among 8 observers were 0.67 for the 1-mm rule and 0.50 for Graham's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of the largest LA best reflects the specific characteristics of CLR, and the 1-mm rule is expected to improve assessment reproducibility </plain></SENT>
