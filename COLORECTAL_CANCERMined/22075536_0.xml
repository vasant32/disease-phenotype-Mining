<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the effectiveness of the regular fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the long term has not been quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied the statistical method developed by Wu and Rosner using data from the Minnesota <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>Colon Cancer</z:hpo> Control Study (MCCCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> initially asymptomatic participants were classified into four mutually exclusive groups: true-early-detection, no-early-detection, over-diagnosis, and symptom-free life; human lifetime was treated as a random variable and is subject to competing risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants in the screening program will eventually fall into one of the four outcomes above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Predictive inferences on the percentages of the four outcomes for both genders were made using the Minnesota study data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Depending on gender, screening frequency and age at the initial screening, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants the probability of "symptom-free-life" varies between 95.3% and 96.6%; the probability of "true-early-detection" is 1.9-3.8%; the probability of no-early-detection is 0.3-2.0%; the probability of over-diagnosis is 0.16-0.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detected by regular FOBT, the probability of over-diagnosis is lower than expected and is between 6% and 9%, with 95% CI (2.5%, 21.3%) for females and (1.9%, 44.7%) for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probability of true-early-detection increases as screening interval decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of no-early-detection decreases as screening interval decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The probability of over-diagnosis among the screen-detected cases is not as high as previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hope this outcome can provide valuable information on the effectiveness of the FOBT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection in the long term </plain></SENT>
