<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) diagnosis reduces life expectancy and decreases patients' well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to assess the determinants of health and functional status and estimate the proportion of remaining life that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors would spend in good health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using Sullivan method, healthy life expectancy was calculated based on survival data of 14,849 CRC survivors within a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry in southern Netherlands and quality of life information among a random sample of these survivors (n = 1,291) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, albeit short life expectancy (LE at age 50 = 12 years for males and 13 years for females), most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors spent a large proportion of their remaining life in good health (74 and 77 %, for males and females, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term survivors may expect to live a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life span (LE at age 50 = 30 years) and spent a large proportion of the remaining life in good health (78 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In distinction, those with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had less than 2 years to live and spent more than half of their remaining life in poor health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients may expect no compromise on living a healthy life, underlining the importance of early detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the high proportion of non-healthy years among stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors confirms the importance of early detection and palliative care </plain></SENT>
