<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence has indicated a role of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) in the pathogenesis of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling of BMP family members is tightly regulated by their <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, including noggin and SOST, which are, in turn, positively regulated by BMP, thereby forming a negative feedback loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the expression of these <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> should be taken into account in studies on the prognostic significance of BMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we correlated protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of BMP6, noggin and SOST, alone or in combination, with patient survival in various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that BMP6 alone was not significantly correlated with esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, a high level of inhibitor of differentiation 1, a downstream factor of BMP6, was associated with shorter survival in patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> stained strongly for BMP6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of noggin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e> cell line EC109, which expresses BMP6 strongly and SOST weakly, enhanced the non-adherent growth of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Noggin and SOST expression levels, when analyzed alone, were not significantly correlated with patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, high BMP6 activity, defined by strong BMP6 expression coupled with weak noggin or SOST expression, was significantly associated with shorter survival in esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We further confirmed that BMP6 activity could be used as a prognostic indicator in prostate, bladder and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, using publicly available data on BMP6, noggin and SOST <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that BMP6, noggin and SOST could be used in combination as a prognostic indicator in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
