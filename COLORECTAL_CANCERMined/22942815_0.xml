<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate Canadian medical oncologists' perspectives on how barriers to accessing new expensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs have affected their practice and their opinions on the drug approval and funding processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Canadian medical oncologists treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were surveyed by means of a self-administered, cross-sectional survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 164 eligible oncologists, there were 68 respondents (41.4% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 29.4% of physicians felt they had been using the ideal first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> considered bevacizumab to be a component of the ideal first-line regimen, only 18% could use bevacizumab routinely, and less than half (44.8%) always discussed its role with their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of accessing unfunded drugs, most physicians agreed that private payment should be allowed for drugs to be delivered at their own centers (76.1%) or private infusion clinics (52.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent of physicians reported major concerns about the drug approval and funding processes, and 85% of physicians supported the establishment of a national drug formulary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Canadian medical oncologists are struggling to provide optimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care for their patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as a result of nonuniform access to preferred therapeutic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In face of these challenges, physicians have had to use clinical trials and private infusion clinics and, at times, may avoid discussing drugs with limited access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many oncologists are dissatisfied with the existing funding mechanism and approval processes and support private payment for unfunded drugs </plain></SENT>
