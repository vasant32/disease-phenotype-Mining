<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to identify and validate the diagnostic value of N-glycan markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and to uncover their underlying molecular mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 347 individuals, including patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, patients with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, and healthy controls, were divided randomly into a training group (n = 287) and retrospective validation groups (n = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum N-glycan profiling was analyzed by DNA sequencer-assisted/flurophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (DSA-FACE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two diagnostic models were constructed based on N-glycan profiling with logistic stepwise regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic performance of each model was assessed further in retrospective, prospective (n = 43), and follow-up (n = 46) cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lectin blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the total core-fucosylated residues and molecular expression involved in core-fucosylation modifications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two diagnostic models designated CRCglycoA and CRCglycoB were constructed to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of both CRCglycoA and CRCglycoB were higher than the AUC of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (CRCglycoA, 0.92 vs 0.81; CRCglycoB, 0.81 vs 0.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and accuracy of CRCglycoA improved from 21.7% to 25% and from 11.63% to 18% in the training cohort, the retrospective cohort, and the prospective cohorts compared with the sensitivity and accuracy of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of CRCglycoB improved from 20% to 28.23% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both altered N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18154">glycans</z:chebi>, and results from the diagnostic models were reversed after curative surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The level of total core <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33984">fucose</z:chebi> residues and fucosyltransferase were decreased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the N-glycan markers based diagnostic models are new, valuable, noninvasive alternatives for identifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that decreased fucosyltransferase may be responsible for decreased levels of total core-fucosylated modification in both tissues and serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
