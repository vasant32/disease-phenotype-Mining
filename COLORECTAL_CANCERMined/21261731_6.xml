<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The gene profiles of TIMP2 and MMP were assayed from 333 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TIMP2-418*G/*G, TIMP2 303*G/*G and MMP9-1562*C/*C were more frequent in patients than in controls (P = 0.020, P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.044, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frequency of TIMP2-418*G/*G was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> than in those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and that of TIMP2 303*G/*G was higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (P = 0.008 and P =0.022, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TIMP2-303*A/*A and MMP2-1575*G/*G were less frequent in patients than in controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TIMP2-418*G303*G haplotype was more frequent (P &lt; 0.0001) and MMP2-1575*G-735*C haplotype was less frequent in patients than in controls (P= 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Specific single-nucleotide polymorphism in TIMP2 and MMP appeared to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and biological behavior in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, which is expected be further verified in a larger cohort in the future </plain></SENT>
