<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, patients who were fit for but had not received previous chemotherapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (arm A), the same combination plus cetuximab (arm B), or intermittent chemotherapy (arm C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The choice of fluoropyrimidine therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> or infused fluouroracil plus leucovorin) was decided before randomisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done centrally (via telephone) by the MRC Clinical Trials Unit using minimisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment allocation was not masked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparison of arms A and C is described in a companion paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the comparison of arm A and B, for which the primary outcome was overall survival in patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analyses with respect to NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR status were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The trial is registered, ISRCTN27286448 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 1630 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups (815 to standard therapy and 815 to addition of cetuximab) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no effect on progression-free survival (8·6 months [IQR 5·0-12·5] in the control group vs 8·6 months [5·1-13·8] in the cetuximab group; HR 0·96, 0·82-1·12, p=0·60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate increased from 57% (n=209) with chemotherapy alone to 64% (n=232) with addition of cetuximab (p=0·049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 and higher skin and gastrointestinal toxic effects were increased with cetuximab (14 vs 114 and 67 vs 97 patients in the control group vs the cetuximab group with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
