<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PubMed and Embase were searched for studies on the accuracy of whole-body imaging for patients with suspected local and/or distant recurrence of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, studies had to have included at least 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 2 × 2 contingency tables had to be provided or derivable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Articles evaluating only local recurrence or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed from the data on sensitivity and specificity of individual studies and pooled estimates of diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) and areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> the Cochran Q test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen observational studies were included which evaluated PET, PET/CT, CT and/or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study results were available in 12 studies for PET, in 5 studies for CT, in 5 studies for PET/CT and in 1 study for MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AUCs for PET, PET/CT and CT were 0.94 (0.90-0.97), 0.94 (0.87-0.98) and 0.83 (0.72-0.90), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patient based analyses PET/CT had a higher diagnostic performance than PET with an AUC of 0.95 (0.89-0.97) for PET/CT vs 0.92 (0.86-0.96) for PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both whole-body PET and PET/CT are very accurate for the detection of local and/or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with a (high) suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CT has the lowest diagnostic performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This difference is probably mainly due to the lower accuracy of CT for detection of extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (including local recurrence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For clinical practice PET/CT might be the modality of choice when evaluating patients with a (high) suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, because of its best performance in patient based analyses and confident prediction of disease status </plain></SENT>
