<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthases (eNOS) have been shown to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the results of such studies are conflicting to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether polymorphisms of the eNOS gene correlated with patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), relative to healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed three polymorphisms of eNOS (-786T&gt;C, 4a4b, and 894G&gt;T) in 509 healthy controls and 528 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was performed using polymerase chain reaction or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the TC+CC genotype of the -786T&gt;C polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared with the TT genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the GT+TT genotype of the 894G&gt;T polymorphism was associated with an increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence was found for any association between the 4a4b polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the C/4b/G (-786T&gt;C/4a4b/894G&gt;T) haplotype was significantly associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and C/4b/T (-786T&gt;C/4a4b/894G&gt;T) haplotype was only detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the eNOS -786T&gt;C and 894G&gt;T polymorphisms may be associated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
