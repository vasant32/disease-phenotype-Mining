<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different approaches may be taken to detect KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There currently are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved assays for the detection of KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For assays that are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the performance characteristics of the assay must be determined and validated by the clinical laboratory before implementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide an example of how a KRAS mutation-analysis assay may be validated in a clinical laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Describing the approach used by an individual laboratory to compare different assays for validation of KRAS mutation analysis in metastatic colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specific validation data are provided, illustrating how a laboratory established assay performance characteristics for KRAS mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> clinical laboratories must establish several performance specifications mandated by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 before implementation of any laboratory-developed test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approaches to the validation of such assays may vary among laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We describe an approach used for validation of a KRAS mutation-analysis assay by one laboratory </plain></SENT>
