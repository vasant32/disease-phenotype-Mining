<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined in C57/BL6 mice the effects of repeated juvenile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6887">methylphenidate</z:chebi> (MPH) exposure on cocaine-reward sensitivity in adulthood and determined whether early MPH treatment alters adult expression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in mesocorticolimbic <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using place conditioning, we show that adult mice exposed to MPH during the juvenile period are less sensitive to cocaine-reward compared to saline-controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by means of immunoblotting, we demonstrate that early MPH treatment attenuates adult <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) selectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results support previous evidence that developmental MPH treatment diminishes cocaine-reward in adulthood and are the first to suggest that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in the VTA may participate in this enduring effect </plain></SENT>
