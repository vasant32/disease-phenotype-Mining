<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, chemotherapy is usually administered without pauses and until progression but patients can experience cumulative toxicity and cannot tolerate a heavy therapeutic charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aim: The aim of the present trial was to evaluate whether an intermittent chemotherapy with levo-leucovorin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) + irinotecan (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11) was at least as effective as the same regimen given continuously, both administered until progression, in patients affected with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and not previously exposed to chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients, materials and methods: A total of 337 patients from 27 institutions were randomised between levo-leucovorin, 100/mg/m(2) i.v. + 5-FU; 400 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus + 5-FU; 600 mg/m(2) 22-h continuous infusion, days 1 and 2 + <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11; 180 mg/m(2) day 1, administered every 2 weeks 2 months on and 2 months off (arm A) and the same regimen administered continuously (arm B), until progression in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main end point was overall survival (OS), the secondary progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 41 months, OS was 18 months in arm A and 17 months in arm B [hazard ratio (HR), 0.88] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also PFS was comparable in the two groups (6 months in both, with HR, 1.03), and even grades 3-4 toxicity (mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and diarrhoea) was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based treatment was administered in a similar percentage (66%) in the two arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median chemotherapy-free period (drug holiday) in arm A was 3.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Reducing the charge of therapy in this population did not diminish the efficacy of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies with this strategy, including biologicals, are warranted </plain></SENT>
