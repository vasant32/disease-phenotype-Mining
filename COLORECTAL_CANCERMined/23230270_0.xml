<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Rho <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio is essential for Rac1 activation downstream of netrin-1/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>, but the molecular mechanisms governing Trio activity remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that Trio is phosphorylated by Src family kinases in the embryonic rat cortex in response to netrin-1 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Though the phospho-null mutant Trio(Y2622F) retained GEF activity toward Rac1, its expression impaired netrin-1-induced Rac1 activation and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>-mediated neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of Trio in cortical neurons reduced the level of cell surface <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> in growth cones, which could be restored by expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Trio but not Trio(Y2622F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings demonstrate that Trio(Y2622) phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>/Trio signaling complex in cortical neurons during netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth </plain></SENT>
