<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a molecular marker that can provide valuable prognostic information for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the predictive role of the MSI status remains less clear than its role in prognostication due to mixed results from previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study investigated the usefulness of the MSI status as a predictive factor for stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who received adjuvant doxifluridine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 3030 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent surgical resection between 1997 and 2006, 564 patients were diagnosed with stage II or III, and adjuvant doxifluridine therapy was administered to 394 patients (70.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MSI status was assessed using the markers BAT25 and BAT26, and samples with instability at both markers were scored as exhibiting high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 564 patients, 290 patients (51.4%) had stage II, and MSI-H was found in 41 patients (7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 35.1 months (range, 0.5-135.2), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) rate were 87.5 and 76.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MSI-H showed a favorable survival trend for OS (P = 0.098) and significant survival benefit for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (P = 0.037) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, the doxifluridine-treated patients with MSI-H showed improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> compared to those with low or stable MSI (MSI-L/S) (P = 0.036), while the MSI status was not significantly associated with OS (P = 0.107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, MSI-H was not significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> (Hazard ratio = 2.467, P = 0.125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study confirmed the positive prognostic role of MSI-H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, MSI-H patients with stage II or III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> did not seem to benefit from doxifluridine adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
