<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> that arise proximal (right) or distal (left) to the splenic flexure exhibit different clinical and biological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although various hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences, their origin remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the clinicopathologic differences between left and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> and comment on the possible explanatory theories behind them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included a total of 388 retrospectively collected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, surgically treated from 1999 to 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences of patients' demographic data and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> micro- and macroscopic characteristics between left and right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were investigated and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were significantly older (mean age 70 vs. 68 years; p&lt;0.05) and had more lymph nodes examined than patients with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> (mean number of nodes 18.9 vs. 12.6; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a lower proportion of T1 stage right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (3.1 vs. 5%) and a higher proportion of stage T2-4 (96.9 vs. 95%) compared with left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p&lt;0.001 for x2 test of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T stages) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a higher mean width and depth (4.3 vs. 3.8 cm and 1.8 vs. 1.6 cm, respectively; p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was a higher percentage of poorly differentiated right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> (41.4 vs. 17.5%; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> affect older patients and are diagnosed at more advanced disease stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms that provoke these differences remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed in order to better understand the true nature of these differences and their possible clinical implications </plain></SENT>
