<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A blood test may be a more acceptable routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening test than faecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and could be safer and cheaper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the accuracy of a serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9) test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in a non-presenting symptomatic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort, aged 50-69 with lower gastrointestinal symptoms, was identified by community-based survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of serum MMP9 was assessed by comparison with colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression identified predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses determined the cutoff to maximise the sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were available for 748 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 46 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis demonstrated that demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, clinical symptoms and raised serum MMP9 concentration were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our final logistic regression model had a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significant association between serum MMP9 concentration and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum MMP9 levels are raised in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and high-risk <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, although MMP9 estimation is likely to have the greatest predictive utility when used as part of a panel of biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to identify biomarkers that are sufficiently accurate for implementing into routine practice </plain></SENT>
