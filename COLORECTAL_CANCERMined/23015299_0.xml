<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cohort study based on data from a prospective clinical database and electronically registered medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Six major colorectal centres in eastern Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 2766 patients (1441 (52%) men) undergoing elective operation for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with colonic or rectal resection and primary anastomosis between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 70 years (interquartile range 62-77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Postoperative use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> (defined as at least two days of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> treatment in the first seven days after surgery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of clinical anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation; mortality at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 2756 patients with available data and included in the final analysis, 1871 (68%) did not receive postoperative <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> treatment (controls) and 885 (32%) did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> group, 655 (74%) patients received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> and 226 (26%) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anastomotic leakage verified at reoperation was significantly increased among patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> treatment, compared with controls (12.8% and 8.2% v 5.1%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After unadjusted analyses and when compared with controls, more patients had anastomotic leakage after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> (7.8% (95% confidence interval 3.9% to 12.8%)) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> (3.2% (1.0% to 5.7%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But after multivariate logistic regression analysis, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> treatment was a risk factor for leakage (odds ratio 7.2 (95% confidence interval 3.8 to 13.4), P&lt;0.001; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> 1.5 (0.8 to 2.9), P=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors for anastomotic leakage were male sex, rectal (v colonic) anastomosis, and blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>30 day mortality was comparable in the three groups (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> 1.8% v <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> 4.1% v controls 3.2%; P=0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">Diclofenac</z:chebi> treatment could result in an increased proportion of patients with anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> should be used with caution after colorectal resections with primary anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Large scale, randomised controlled trials are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
