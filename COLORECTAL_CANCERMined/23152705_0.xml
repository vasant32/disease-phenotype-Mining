<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a review and meta-analysis to evaluate survival after resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLMs) and estimated the summary effect for seven prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Studies published between 1999 and 2010, indexed on Medline, that reported survival after resection of CLMs, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-relative risks for survival by prognostic factor were calculated, stratified by study size and annual clinic volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cumulative meta-analysis results by annual clinic volume were plotted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five- and 10-year survival ranged from 16% to 74% (median 38%) and 9% to 69% (median 26%), respectively, based on 60 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall summary median survival time was 3.6 (range: 1.7-7.3) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meta-relative risks (95% confidence intervals) by prognostic factor were: node positive primary, 1.6 (1.5-1.7); carcinoembryonic antigen level, 1.9 (1.1-3.2); extrahepatic disease, 1.9 (1.5-2.4); poor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> grade, 1.9 (1.3-2.7); positive margin, 2.0 (1.7-2.5); &gt;1 liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, 1.6 (1.4-1.8); and &gt;3 cm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diameter, 1.5 (1.3-1.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cumulative meta-analyses by annual clinic volume suggested improved survival with increasing volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall median survival following CLM liver resection was 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven investigated prognostic factors showed a modest but significant predictive relationship with survival, and certain prognostic factors may prove useful in determining optimal therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Due to the increasing complexity of surgical interventions for CLM and the inclusion of patients with higher disease burdens, future studies should consider the potential for selection and referral bias on survival </plain></SENT>
