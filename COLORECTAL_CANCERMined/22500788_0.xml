<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of SEMS to palliate colorectal malignant obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Malignant colorectal obstructive patients who underwent SEMS insertion at the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center, Korea from January 2004 to June 2008 were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' clinical characteristics, outcomes and complications for palliative SEMS insertion were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were enrolled in the palliative SEMS group and 48 patients with obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were included in the SEMS as the bridge to surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Obstruction of the left colon occurred in 52 patients of the palliative SEMS group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in SEMS as bridge to surgery group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For primary SEMS insertion, the technical success (TS) rate was 87.0% and the clinical success (CS) rate 89.4%, while the rates of early and late complications were 24.1% and 23.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no procedure-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stent migration rate was higher in the cases treated with small diameter and covered type of stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to reobstruction and migration were 85 and 101 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TS and CS rates for SEMS reinsertion were comparable to those for primary SEMS insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Palliative SEMS are effective and favorable procedures for malignant colorectal obstruction but with some complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stent migration is associated with covered type and small diameter stents while other factors including length of stent and chemotherapy do not affect stent complications in the present study </plain></SENT>
