<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MYOD-1 gene which is a muscle differentiation gene has been showed to be significantly methylated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> which, is an age related event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However the role of this gene in the colonic mucosa is not understood and whether methylation occurs in subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have determined the frequency of methylation of the MYOD-1 gene in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa and investigated to see if this is associated with established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors primarily ageing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analysed colonic mucosal biopsies in 218 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and demonstrated that in most individuals promoter hypermethylation was not quantified for MYOD-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, promoter hypermethylation increased significantly with age (p&lt;0.001 using regression analysis) and this was gender independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also showed that gene promoter methylation increased positively with an increase in waist to hip (WHR) ratio - the latter is also a known risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that promoter gene hypermethylation of the MYOD-1 gene increases significantly with age in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and thus may offer potential as a putative biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
