<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> or wogonin, several apoptotic events were observed, including DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and increased cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">Baicalein</z:chebi> and wogonin decreased Bcl-2 expression, whereas the expression of Bax was increased in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was accompanied by an inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> to mice resulted in the inhibition of the growth of HT-29 xenografts without any toxicity following 5 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2979">baicalein</z:chebi> induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via Akt activation in a p53-dependent manner in the HT-29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and that it may serve as a chemopreventive or therapeutic agent for HT-29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
