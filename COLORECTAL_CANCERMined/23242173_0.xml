<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several methods for mutation testing are in use and the need for external quality assurance has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An often little addressed but important issue in external quality assurance schemes is a low percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in the test samples, where the analytical sensitivity of most tests becomes critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using artificial samples based on a mixture of cell lines with known mutation status of the KRAS gene, we assessed the reliability of a series of commonly used methods (Sanger sequencing, high resolution melting, pyrosequencing, and amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction) on samples with 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 % mutated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine laboratories throughout Europe participated and submitted a total of ten data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The limit of detection of each method differed, ranging from &gt;15-5 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> methods showed a decreasing correct mutation call rate proportionally with decreasing percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that laboratories and clinicians need to be aware of the decrease in correct mutation call rate proportionally with decreasing percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and that external quality assurance schemes need to address the issue of low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell percentage in the test samples </plain></SENT>
