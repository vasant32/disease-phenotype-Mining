<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16664">Albendazole</z:chebi> (ABZ) is a microtubule depolymerizing agent with a remarkable activity against a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of water solubility limits its application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to formulate ABZ with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>/2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) with the view of improving its aqueous solubility and therefore, its antitumor efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: ABZ was dissolved in <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> and 25% HPβCD (w/v) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice received a single dose of ABZ/HPβCD or a conventional suspension in hydroxypropyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl cellulose</z:chebi> (HPMC) over 24 h and the concentration of ABZ and its metabolites in plasma were measured by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antitumor efficacy of the two formulations were then evaluated and compared in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice bearing HCT-116 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ionization with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> together with complexation with hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) dramatically improved the solubility of ABZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC) of ABZ and its active metabolite, ABZ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35813">sulfoxide</z:chebi> (ABZSO) were approximately 2.3- and 7.3-folds higher in mice that received ABZ/HPβCD in comparison with animals that were treated with ABZ/HPMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of ABZSO was nearly 18-times higher in mice that received ABZ/HPβCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a significant delay in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> that led to longer survival in mice was observed in the ABZ/HPβCD-treated group as compared to the ABZ/HPMC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the combination of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> and HPβCD significantly improves the solubility, pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor efficacy of ABZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This newly-developed formulation of ABZ may be suitable for parenteral administration </plain></SENT>
