<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Population-based study SETTING: French <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Digestive Cancer</z:e> Registry, Burgundy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand nine hundred twenty-one incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: The independent influence of comorbidities (recorded according to the Charlson index) on treatment was analyzed using multivariate logistic regressions controlling for age, sex, and their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The association between comorbidities and resection for cure was significant only in patients younger than 75 (P interaction=.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For Stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, 40.4% of the patients aged 75 and older had adjuvant chemotherapy, versus 90.5% of those younger than 75 (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between comorbidities and adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage III <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was significant only in patients younger than 75 (P interaction=.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients aged 75 and older were less likely to receive chemotherapy, even when they had few or no comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 29.3% of patients aged 75 and older with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> had palliative chemotherapy, versus 77.1% of those younger than 75 (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whatever the age, palliative chemotherapy was less frequent for a Charlson comorbidity index of 2 or greater (P interaction=.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was administered in 59.0% of patients aged 75 and older with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, versus 85.3% of those younger than 75 (P&lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whatever the age, patients with a Charlson score of 2 or greater were less likely to receive radiotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> than were patients without comorbidities (P interaction=.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further studies are warranted to identify more precisely the reasons for lower treatment rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the older population </plain></SENT>
