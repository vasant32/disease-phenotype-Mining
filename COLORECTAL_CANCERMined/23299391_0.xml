<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolism of irinotecan to SN38 is inefficient and subject to considerable patient-to-patient variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One approach to more controlled administration of the anticancer agent is direct administration of the active SN38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A nanoparticulate formulation of SN38 was prepared by a method of precipitation with compressed antisolvent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nanoparticulate SN38 efficiently inhibited the proliferation of colorectal, ovarian, and mesothelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations resulting in 50Â % inhibition of proliferation were approximately 1000 fold lower for nanoparticulate SN38 compared to irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo effects were examined using colorectal and ovarian mouse model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model of peritoneally disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> intraperitoneal administration of irinotecan was favorable to intravenous delivery however intraperitoneal delivery of nanoparticulate SN38 was significantly more effective than intraperitoneal irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, in a mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> model administration of nanoparticulate SN38 once weekly exhibited greater activity compared to daily or weekly administration of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional studies demonstrated nanoparticulate SN38 administered as a combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> was more effective than the combination of irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results from the present studies using preclinical colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> model systems demonstrate the efficacy of nanoparticulate SN38 and substantiate continued development </plain></SENT>
