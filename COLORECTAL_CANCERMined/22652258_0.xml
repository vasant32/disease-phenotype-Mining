<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that an average number of more than 0.8 detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> was a quality criteria of screening colonoscopies performed for positive Hemoccult(Â®) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The superiority of brush-sampling fecal immunological test compared to guaiac fecal occult blood test has been demonstrated in two studies, with doubled and tripled detection rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677898" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">invasive cancers</z:e> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility is a major quality factor of the histopathological analysis of malignant colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> treated by endoscopic polypectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inter-observer concordance was satisfying for the invasion depth and the resection margins, but inadequate for the degree of differentiation, the budding, the degree of submucosal infiltration and vascular embol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reliability was enhanced by the importance of the endoscopic activity in center and by the orientation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic evidence of downsizing after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> was predictive of better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a randomized trial, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy was more toxic in patients older than 70 years, inducing a decreased frequency of surgery and more frequent permanent colostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After retrospective analysis of individual data from patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> included in four clinical trials, the resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was an independent predictive factor of overall and progression free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A prospective randomized trial must confirm this result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A study confirmed the important contribution of diffusion-weighted MRI in the preoperative evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Promising data were presented concerning the intensification of chemotherapy, hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy and integration of targeted therapies to increase the resectability rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In palliative setting, the promising action of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50924">sorafenib</z:chebi> and nintedanib) in phase I-II studies will warrant further clinical development </plain></SENT>
