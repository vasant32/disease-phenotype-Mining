<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the significance and the impact of focal FDG uptake in the colon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> patients without known colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken on 2,220 (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies carried out consecutively in the Nuclear Medicine Department in our hospital from 2 December 2008 to 31 May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were patients with abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake in colorectal area that could not be explained (or not previously known) by their clinical histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients previously diagnosed with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 86 patients (57 male, average age 63.4, range 46-85) were finally included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy with biopsy was established as a reference test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of these findings on the diagnostic-therapeutic management in these patients was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A colonoscopy was performed in 54 of the 86 patients, this examination not having been done up-to-date in the remaining 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsy was obtained in 43 lesions of the 54 patient in whom a colonoscopy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Colon disease was detected in 49 of these 54 patients, obtaining 54 FDG incidental foci which corresponded to 10 previously unsuspected primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 3 metastases, 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> with different degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and 14 inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 patients, the colonoscopy was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PET/CT modified the diagnostic and treatment management in most of the patients (49/54, that is 91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the need to determine the cause of abnormal (18)F-FDG colorectal uptakes in the PET/CT studies by using colonoscopy and biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This approach allows for the detection and early treatment of malignant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850639" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">premalignant lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
