<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sequences of molecular events that initiate and advance the progression of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are becoming clearer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accepting that these events, once they are in place, accumulate over time, rapid disease progression might be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> usually develops slowly over decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Emerging insights suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell microenvironment encompassing fibroblasts and endothelial and immune cells dictate when, whether, and how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signaling pathways that affect the microenvironment and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> seem to play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, some of these pathways directly regulate the stem/progenitor cell niche at the base of the crypt; it now appears that the survival and growth of neoplastic cells often relies upon their subverted engagement of these pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spurned on by the use of gene manipulation technologies in the mouse, dissecting and recapitulating these complex molecular interactions between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and its microenvironment in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a reality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel, our ability to isolate and grow GI stem cells in vitro enables us, for the first time, to complement reductionist in vitro findings with complex in vivo observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, data suggest that the large number of signaling pathways underpinning the reciprocal interaction between the neoplastic epithelium and its microenvironment converge on a small number of common transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the separate and interactive roles of NFÎºB, Stat3, and Myb, transcription factors commonly overexpressed or excessively activated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They confer molecular links between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, stroma, the stem cell niche, and neoplastic cell growth </plain></SENT>
