<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The importance of 17β-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> (E2) in the prevention of large bowel <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> has been shown in many epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extragonadal E2 may form by the aromatase pathway from androstenedione or the sulfatase pathway from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi> (E1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> followed by E1 reduction to E2 by 17-β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35350">hydroxysteroid</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (HSD17B1), so HSD17B1 gene expression may play an important role in the production of E2 in peripheral tissue, including the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HSD17B1 expression was analyzed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines (HT29, SW707) and primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> tissues collected from fifty two patients who underwent radical colon surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically unchanged colonic mucosa located at least 10-20 cm away from the cancerous lesions was obtained from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression level of HSD17B1 using quantitative PCR and western blot were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation level in the 5' flanking region of HSD17B1 CpG rich region was assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> DNA sequencing and HRM analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of DNA methylation on HSD17B1 expression was further evaluated by ChIP analysis in HT29 and SW707 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">estrone</z:chebi> (E1) in to E2 was determined by electrochemiluminescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found a significant decrease in HSD17B1 transcript (p = 0.0016) and protein (p = 0.0028) levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) from the proximal but not distal colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This reduced HSD17B1 expression was associated with significantly increased DNA methylation (p = 0.003) in the CpG rich region located in the 5' flanking sequence of the HSD17B1 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the proximal but not distal colon and rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also showed that 5-dAzaC induced demethylation of the 5' flanking region of HSD17B1, leading to increased occupation of the promoter by Polymerase II, and increased transcript and protein levels in HT29 and SW707 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, which contributed to the increase in E2 formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that reduced HSD17B1 expression can be associated with DNA methylation in the 5' flanking region of HSD17B1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from the proximal colon </plain></SENT>
