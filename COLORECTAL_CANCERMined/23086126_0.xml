<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We evaluated the incidence and survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) among this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program were used to calculate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> age-adjusted and age-specific incidence rates in Hispanics during 1993-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporal trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence were examined using annual percent change (APC) and Poisson regression. The 1- and 5-year survival rates were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual age-adjusted incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Hispanics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages declined from 47.4 per 100,000 in 1993-1997 to 43.8 per 100,000 in 2003-2007, with an APC during 1993-2007 equal to -0.8/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a 45 % increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence among Hispanic men and women aged 20-49 years that affected both the right and left colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases with regional (+37 %) and distant (+18 %) spread increased, now constituting 72 % of cases diagnosed at that age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Poisson model confirmed the increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence in Hispanics aged 20-49 years during 1993-2007 while adjusting for sex and geographic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1-year survival improved in younger Hispanics from approximately 86 % in 1993-1997 to 91 % in 2003-2007 with no significant improvement in 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Hispanics aged &gt;50 years, no significant improvements in survival were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in young Hispanic men and women has increased in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most are diagnosed with regional or distant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No significant improvement in long-term survival was observed in young Hispanics with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
