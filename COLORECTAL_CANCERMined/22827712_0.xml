<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quality of care was measured with the Quality of Care from the Patient Perspective (QPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed; RESULTS: Patients receiving specialized care were significantly more likely to report the quality of care as better in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three QPP dimensions investigated than those receiving non-specialized care; CONCLUSIONS: In order to promote and maintain good quality of care for surgically treated patients with FAP, and to minimize the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, specialized care, including continuity and easy access of health care professionals, should be provided </plain></SENT>
