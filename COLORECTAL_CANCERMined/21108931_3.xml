<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that stability of Î²-catenin, which functions as an oncogene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF43, is highly expressed in human colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and that RNF43 promotes cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the involvement of RNF43 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> has not been fully elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found by using yeast two-hybrid screening that RNF43 binds to NEDD-4-like ubiquitin-protein ligase-1 (NEDL1), which enhances pro-apoptotic activity by p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that RNF43 also interacts with p53 and that RNF43 suppresses transcriptional activity of p53 in H1299 cells and attenuates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by ultraviolet irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that RNF43 is associated with p53-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in collaboration with NEDL1 in colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
