<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several proteins have been studied in relation to the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein p53 (p53) and antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki-67 (Ki-67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of p53 and Ki-67 in colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and correlate the observed levels with clinical and pathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The sample consisted of 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> from patients undergoing colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After performing polypectomy, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were preserved in a formalin solution with 10% (vol./vol.) phosphate buffer, submitted for routine preparation of sections and slides and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> we then performed immunohistochemistry to detect specific p53 and Ki-67 proteins using a streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-peroxidase enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: p53 was detected in 18% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average Ki-67 protein index (i.Ki-67) was 0.49 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was observed in p53 (P = 0.0003) and Ki-67 (P = 0.02) expression between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with low- and high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, particularly for p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of Ki-67 was greater in rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> than in colic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No relationship was found between the expression of the two proteins in the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The p53 protein is expressed in a proportion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, while the Ki-67 protein was expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expression of p53 was higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of Ki-67 was higher in rectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
