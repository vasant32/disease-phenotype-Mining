<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a target gene of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) can be quickly induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation but it then strongly inhibits IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation, functioning as a negative feedback regulator of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant activation of STAT3 and/or reduced expression of SOCS are strongly correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, which therefore becomes a promising target for the development of novel anticancer chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pien Tze Huang (PZH) is a well-known traditional Chinese formula that was first prescribed by a royal physician 450 years ago in the Ming Dynasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been used in China and Southeast Asia for centuries as a folk remedy for various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism of its antitumor activity remains largely unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that PZH could significantly and dose-dependently inhibit IL-6-mediated increase of STAT3 phosphorylation levels and transcriptional activity in the human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> HT-29 cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, PZH treatment profoundly inhibited IL-6-induced upregulation of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, two key target genes of the STAT3 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PZH treatment increased the expression of SOCS3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PZH could effectively inhibit proliferation and promote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells via modulation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway and its target genes </plain></SENT>
