<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 104 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients treated with standard chemotherapy with bevacizumab and examined the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> and its clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> in four patients (3.85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 64.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients had a history of smoking; median smoking index was 40 pack-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except one patient who had asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo>, chest computed tomography before chemotherapy showed no fibrotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function test before chemotherapy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had received median 10 cycles (range 10-15 cycles) of FOLFOX before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>Interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> developed during FOLFOX + bevacizumab in two patients and during FOLFIRI + bevacizumab in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median duration from the last chemotherapy to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> was 3.5 days (range 2-8 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients showed Grade 3 or more severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High-dose steroid therapy was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006530'>Interstitial lung disease</z:hpo> induced by standard chemotherapy with bevacizumab is rare, but rapidly progressed and were severe in our experience </plain></SENT>
