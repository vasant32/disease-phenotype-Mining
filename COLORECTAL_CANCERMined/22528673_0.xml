<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few data are available from the Western world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to report on the first experiences and the learning curve of colorectal ESD in a European center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 82 rectosigmoid lesions were referred for ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion characteristics, resection rates, procedure times, complications, and recurrences were recorded prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were compared between three consecutive study periods in order to determine the learning curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesions were located in the rectum (86.6 %) and the sigmoid colon (13.4 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median diameter was 45.5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesions were of Paris type 0-Is with pit pattern type V (n = 8), 0-IIa (n = 33), 0-IIa + Is (n = 36), and 0-IIa + IIc (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> rate in these groups was 100 %, 0 %, 14 %, and 20 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ESD was possible in 76 lesions (92.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>En bloc resection rate and R0 resection rate were 81.6 % and 69.7 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median procedure time was 176 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Between the three consecutive study periods, en bloc resection rate increased (60.0 %, 88.0 %, 96.2 %), R0 resection rate increased (48.0 %, 76.0 %, 84.5 %; P &lt; 0.001), and procedure time decreased (200, 193, 136 minutes; P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rates were 1.3 % and 7.9 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrence risk was 0 % after R0 en bloc resection and 41.7 % after piecemeal resection (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 23.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the European setting, ESD in the distal colon is feasible with acceptable complication risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Resection rates were not as high as those from Japanese studies; however, a clear learning curve could be shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Colorectal ESD needs to be further evaluated, particularly in Europe where ESD experience is low </plain></SENT>
