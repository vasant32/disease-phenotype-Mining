<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, very limited data addressing the best candidates for repeated pulmonary resection is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for retrospective studies evaluating lung metastasectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included studies with available data about repeated pulmonary metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential prognostic factors were analyzed for possible impact on survival following the second metastasectomy through univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2008, 944 lung metastasectomies were carried out on 759 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those, 148 patients had a second metastasectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 52 % for patients who had 1 metastasectomy and 57.9 % from the second metastasectomy for patients who had repeated resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 2 metastatic pulmonary nodules and maximum diameter of largest pulmonary nodule ≥3 cm were the only independent factors associated with inferior survival following repeated pulmonary resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, repeated pulmonary metastasectomy offers an excellent chance for long-term survival and is associated with a quite low operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 2 metastatic nodules and a maximum diameter of the largest metastatic lung nodule of ≥3 cm have a significantly inferior survival </plain></SENT>
