<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of chemotherapy is generally evaluated by computed tomography (CT) imaging using standardized criteria (RECIST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, RECIST is not always optimal, and other criteria have been shown to correlate with pathologic response and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of different CT measurement for response assessment after initiation of chemotherapy in patients with synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> were evaluated retrospectively at 2 academic centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different size, volume, ratio and attenuation parameters were determined at baseline and after 3 cycles of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of baseline measurements and of the change between baseline and second measurements was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time to progression was 279 days, median overall survival was 704 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this selective patient population, neither a significant prognostic value of initial baseline CT parameters nor a prognostic value of the change between the first and the second CT measurements was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial morphological response assessment using different CT measurements has no prognostic value concerning time to progression or overall survival in patients with synchronous colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
