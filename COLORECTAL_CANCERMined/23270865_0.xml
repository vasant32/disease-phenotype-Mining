<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether patients accurately recall results from their colonoscopy examinations or features of specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a 35-question survey was given to outpatients at the Digestive Disease Institute at the Cleveland Clinic who had previously undergone colonoscopy there </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected responses from 233 participants (mean age, 59 y; 49% male); they provided demographic information, along with responses to questions on past colonoscopies, personal and family history of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> by colonoscopy, and number and other key features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient responses were compared with medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the patients surveyed, 82% correctly recalled the presence or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 118 who correctly reported having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, 61% correctly recalled the number, 26% recalled the size, and 6%-33% recalled features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 8% of individuals correctly recalled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 key features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (size, number, and pathology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients' age when they underwent colonoscopy, current age, sex, education, or method by which they received their colonoscopy results did not significantly affect the accuracy with which they recalled the presence or key features of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-two percent of patients examined by colonoscopy correctly recalled whether or not they had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, most patients did not recall key details about their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (number, size, or pathology features) required to establish appropriate screening and surveillance intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New tools are needed to ensure that patients understand the importance of their colonoscopy findings and improve their recall accuracy </plain></SENT>
