<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of patients is largely determined by the clinical and pathological stage at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population screening has been shown to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-related mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most screening programs worldwide rely on fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of a FIT screening program is not only influenced by initial participation rate, but also by program adherence during consecutive screening rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We aim to evaluate the participation rate in and yield of a third <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening round using FIT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND DESIGN: Four years after the first screening round and two years after the second round, a total number of approximately 11,000 average risk individuals (50 to 75 years of age) will be invited to participate in a third round of FIT-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We will select individuals in the same target area as in the previous screening rounds, using the electronic database of the regional municipal administration registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will invite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FIT-negatives and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-participants in previous screening rounds, as well as eligible first time invitees who have moved into the area or have become 50 years of age.FITs will be analyzed in the special technique laboratory of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> FIT-positives will be invited for a consultation at the outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the absence of contra-indications, a colonoscopy will follow at the Academic Medical Center or at the Flevohospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measures are the participation rate, defined as the proportion of invitees that return a FIT in this third round of FIT-screening, and the diagnostic yield of the program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: This study will provide precise data on the participation in later FIT screening rounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This enables to estimate the effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs that rely on repeated FIT- screening, such as the one that will be implemented in the Netherlands in 2013 </plain></SENT>
