<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Approximately 7.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are considered to originate from the alternative, serrated route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the expression of the c-MYC oncogene and the SIRT1 protein deacetylase by immunohistochemical staining in subgroups of colorectal serrated lesions that were characterized by different molecular alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of c-MYC and SIRT1 correlated with the presence of KRAS and BRAF mutations and high expression of c-MYC and SIRT1 was strongly associated with higher grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the majority of serrated lesions without KRAS or BRAF mutations, c-MYC and SIRT1 expression was not found increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group only a subset of mostly high grade intraepithelial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was characterized by elevated c-MYC and SIRT1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with nuclear localization of beta-catenin, indicating that Wnt pathway activation may confer transcriptional induction of c-MYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, we established a link between oncogenic K-Ras and B-Raf, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of c-MYC through MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway activation, as well as for Wnt signalling to the activation of the c-MYC oncogene, and consequently of SIRT1 in the serrated route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increasing expressions with higher grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> suggest crucial functions for c-MYC and SIRT1 in the progression of serrated lesions to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These functions may include antagonizing of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and senescence, which are characteristic features of serrated lesions </plain></SENT>
