<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we have investigated the methylation status of four PTPRs: PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1, which were pre-selected using microarray techniques as being alternatively methylated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analyses were carried out on 131 surgical specimens obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The methylation status of the four genes was examined using <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> specific PCR (MSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of promoter methylation using an Illumina 27K microarray revealed four protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRR and PTPRZ1 as being hypermethylated with β-value ≥0.2 and P≤0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis using MSP confirmed these observations-the frequency of promoter methylation was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells compared with matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue for each of the analyzed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no association observed between the methylation status of PTPRs and either CIMP, K-ras (codon 12) and BRAF (exon 15, V600E) mutations or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization (proximal/distal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of our study show a statistically significant difference between promoter methylation in cancerous and healthy tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This result supports the hypothesis that the PTPR family has an important role in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
