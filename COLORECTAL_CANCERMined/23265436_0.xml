<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess the mechanism of obstruction in obstructing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five cases of obstructing colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 34 cases of non-obstructing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were immunohistochemically analyzed using antibodies for pan-cytokeratin, α-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinase-7, 47-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp47), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), myeloperoxidase, and CD68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-obstructing cases, obstructing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases included lesions of poorer differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A higher value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding was observed in obstructing than in non-obstructing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher number of α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, a higher expression of Hsp47 in stromal spindle cells, and a higher expression of bFGF in inflammatory cells were also significant in obstructing <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, obstructing colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> were characterized by poorer differentiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells, a high level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> budding, and stromal myofibroblast proliferation resulting in <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlative Hsp47 expression in fibroblasts with bFGF in inflammatory cells may contribute to stromal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
