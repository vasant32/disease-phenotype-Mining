<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few reports have shown the efficacy of bevacizumab as used in daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who began receiving bevacizumab in participating facilities from June 2007 to October 2008 were retrospectively analyzed for safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were assessed by the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response Evaluation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> criteria, version 1.0, was used for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 212 patients from 17 institutions were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to bevacizumab included gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in 3, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 7, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 30 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Response rates were 62.5, 30.1 and 11.8% overall among patients receiving bevacizumab as first-, second- and third-line or greater therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median progression-free survival was 14.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.8-18.1], 7.8 (95% CI: 6.5-9.1) and 6.0 (95% CI: 4.6-7.3) months, and median overall survival was 32.5 (95% CI: 24.6-40.3), 16.4 (95% CI: 14.4-18.5) and 11.8 (95% CI: 8.6-15.0) months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The general cohort of patients in HGCSG0801 showed a similar efficacy and safety profile of bevacizumab as seen in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size was small and there were several study limitations, these results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in Japan might safely receive and benefit from bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in daily practice, as is seen in patients in other countries </plain></SENT>
