<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We examined the methodological quality of guidelines on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> genetic susceptibility syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Google were searched up to July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adjourned guidelines in English were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was used to assess their quality, and the reported evidence base of the guidelines was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The search yielded 17 eligible guidelines: 11 were developed by independent associations, while 6 had national\state endorsement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three guidelines performed satisfactorily, achieving a score &gt;50% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 AGREE domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean standardized scores for the 6 AGREE domains were: 'scope and purpose', 83.9 ± 22.5%; 'stakeholder involvement', 35.6 ± 24.9%; 'rigour of development', 48.6 ± 25.3%; 'clarity and presentation', 71.6 ± 19.3%; 'applicability', 33.8 ± 30.1%; 'editorial independence', 42.2 ± 39.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Guidelines with national endorsement performed better in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the domains, with a statistically significant difference in three domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen guidelines out of 17 were found to be based on research evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is scope, in many areas, for improving the guidelines analysed, among which are the involvement of various professional figures and patients' representatives, and policies for their application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The AGREE instrument is a useful tool and could also be used profitably by guideline developers to improve the quality of recommendations </plain></SENT>
