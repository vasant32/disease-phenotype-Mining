<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evaluating and improving the quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care requires complete information on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital-based registries are a key tool in this effort, but reports in the 1990s showed that they fail to identify a major fraction of outpatient-administered treatment, including chemotherapy, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> therapy, and radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This can limit their value for evaluating patterns and quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the completeness of registry data in more recent years, we linked administrative claims from 2 private payers in Ohio to the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Base and Ohio <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Incidence and Surveillance System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Incident breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> among Ohio residents diagnosed in 2004-2006 were identified from linkage of the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Data Base, Ohio <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Incidence and Surveillance System, and payer insurance claims using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> procedure codes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 diagnosis codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage was accomplished using patient demographics, surgery dates, and hospital facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment found in claims and registry data were compared and assessed using the Îº statistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analytic cohort included 2,552 breast and 822 colorectal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results showed high agreement for breast surgery type, and moderately high agreement for colorectal surgery type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For breast cases, the registries captured 87% of chemotherapy, 86% of radiation, and 64% of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> treatment in claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For colorectal cases, the registry captured 83% of chemotherapy and 84% of radiation in claims </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-based registries for breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> diagnosed in 2004-2006 captured about 85% of radiation and chemotherapy data compared with claims data, a higher percentage than earlier reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings provide direction and a cautionary note to those using registry data for study of patterns and quality of systemic and radiation therapy care </plain></SENT>
