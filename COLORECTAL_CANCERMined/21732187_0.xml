<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsets of immune cells can both support and inhibit immunological interaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the clinical impact of T cells that are supposed to be responsible for the down regulation of a T cell response: regulatory T cells or Tregs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population (n = 76) consisted of a random population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who did not receive any (neo-) adjuvant therapy, with a median follow-up time of 7.3 years (range 0.1-23.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of FoxP3 was used as an immunohistochemical marker to identify Tregs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We considered FoxP3+ cells present in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stroma and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> epithelium separately, and related results to clinical outcome and to data on CD8+ immune cell infiltration that we previously obtained in the same patient cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples showed presence of Foxp3+ cells and in the majority of the patients (85.5%) these cells were also present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> epithelial compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relative high level of Foxp3+ cells in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> epithelium was significantly related to down regulation of HLA Class I expression (p-value 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend, but no significant relation, towards a longer overall survival (p-value; 0.084) and disease-free survival (p-value; 0.073) when high levels of Foxp3+ cells were present in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the ratio of CD8+/Foxp3+ cells did show a significant correlation with distant-recurrence-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was the case for both Foxp3+ cells specifically located in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> epithelium (p-value 0.024) as well as in the stroma compartment (p-value 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately due to the small sample size the ratios did not retain their statistical significance in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results provide further evidence that local interactions in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> microenvironment between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and immune cells are not only determined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell-related factors like HLA expression, but also by interactions among immune cells </plain></SENT>
