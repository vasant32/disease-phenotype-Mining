<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective observational multicentre study was carried out to estimate the direct costs of care over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case report forms, medical records, and claims data were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> applied to document medical and resource usage data in real-world settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>QoL was measured by using the Short Form-12 Health Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total 101 patients (mean age 67.09 ± 11.13 years, 68 % male) from 12 different settings were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean costs per patient during the 1st and 2nd years were calculated to be 42,361&lt;euro&gt; and 32,023&lt;euro&gt;, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highest mean costs were calculated for the second quarter, which reached an amount of 12,900&lt;euro&gt; (95 % CI: 11,127&lt;euro&gt;-14,673&lt;euro&gt;) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean physical summary scores and mean mental summary scores were 41.8 and 49.7, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the costs of palliative care and the quality of life of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in real-world health-care delivery in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It could be shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment represents an enormous economic burden to the German health-care system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased efforts in promoting effective and efficient treatment options, or performance-based medication reimbursement schemes, might be helpful in reducing the costs </plain></SENT>
