<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> is effectively attained and <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> consumption is reduced if <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> titration is coadjuvated by a continuous infusion protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, consenting patients were randomized to receive a minimal ("sub-<z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi>") dose of <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> 0.01 mg/kg/h background infusion plus a 0.01 mg/kg bolus (BI), or a 1.5mg bolus-only <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> (B0) (bolus ratio âˆ¼1:2) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients (51 males, age 26-95 years) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total mean <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> consumption during the 48 h was 25% lower in the BI than in the B0 group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
