<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, additional information could be useful, and there is a significant interest in identifying molecular markers that are related to genetic or epigenetic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed the expression of the high-mobility group A2 (previously high-mobility group 1-C [HMGI-C]) protein in 103 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases to determine its use as a biomarker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> to integrate morphological staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a progressive increase of the high-mobility group A2 protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples from cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells were negative up to cases in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells stained positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased high-mobility group A2 expression is strongly associated with an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasiveness, which was measured through both budding and vascular invasion (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a decrease in overall survival when vascular invasion is present (P = .023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a fraction of the analyzed samples showed high-mobility group A2-positive stromal fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although high-mobility group A2-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were associated with cell invasiveness, high-mobility group A2-positive stromal fibroblasts were correlated with less invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High-mobility group A2 protein expression could be used as a prognostic marker to provide prospective information on patient outcome, complementing the data obtained using conventional pathologic staging systems </plain></SENT>
