<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess possible risk factors for urinary leakage of a newly formed urinary conduit after a partial or total pelvic exenteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An analysis was conducted from prospectively collected data of patients who underwent a pelvic exenteration with conduit formation for advanced and recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751416" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pelvic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 232 patients undergoing a pelvic exenteration, 74 (32%) had a conduit formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 47 (64%) had an ileal conduit compared with 27 (36%) a colonic conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve (16%) patients developed a leak, of which nine occurred within the first month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with a conduit leak included involvement of R2 surgical margins (43%), the magnitude of the exenteration and a current cardiovascular medical history (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leaks were not found to be associated with either radiotherapy or chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day leak rate for ileal conduits was 17% (8/47) and 4% (1/27) for colonic conduits with enterocutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> only occurring in the ileal conduit group (2/47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>Fistula</z:mpath>, drained collections and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> occurred in 40% of ileal and 19% of colonic conduits (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a conduit leak had a longer length of stay (59 versus 23 days, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urine leaks after conduit formation in association with exenterations are relatively common with a prolonged length of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Positive surgical margins and exenterations involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four quadrants of the pelvis were associated with higher leak rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of a difference between ileal and colonic conduits and number of leaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However colonic conduits had less total complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, leak and pelvic collections with comparatively no complications of a small bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
