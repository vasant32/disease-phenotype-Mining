<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Wnt/Tcf, Lgr5, Ascl2 and/or Bmi1 signalling is believed to define the mouse intestinal stem cell niche(s) from which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> arise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the relevance of these putative intestinal stem cell markers to human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 19 putative intestinal stem cell markers, including Ascl2 and Lgr5, were identified from published data and an evaluation of a human colorectal gene expression database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Associations between these genes were assessed by isotopic in situ hybridisation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) in 57 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiplex fluorescent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> and chromogenic non-isotopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> were performed to confirm expression patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognostic significance of Lgr5 was assessed in 891 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ascl2 and Lgr5 were expressed in 85% and 74% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> respectively, and expression was positively correlated (p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression of Bmi1 was observed in 47% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> but was very weak in 98% of cases with expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both Ascl2 and/or Lgr5 were positively correlated with the majority of genes in the signature but neither was correlated with Cdk6, Gpx2, Olfm4 or Tnfrsf19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lgr5 did not have prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that 74-85% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> express a Lgr5/Ascl2 associated signature and support the hypothesis that they derive from Lgr5(+)/Ascl2(+) crypt stem cells, not Bmi1(+) stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, Olfm4 was not found to be a useful marker of Lgr5(+) cells in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this large series, Lgr5 expression is not associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo>, as might be expected from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell marker </plain></SENT>
