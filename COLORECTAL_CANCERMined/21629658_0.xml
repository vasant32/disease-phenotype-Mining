<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of the calcium binding protein, Calbindin 2 (CALB2), in regulating the response of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that CALB2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were down-regulated in p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and p53 null isogenic HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines following 48 h and 72 h 5-FU treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 5-FU-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was significantly reduced in HCT116 and LS174T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines in which CALB2 expression had been silenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further investigation revealed that CALB2 translocated to the mitochondria following 5-FU treatment and that 5-FU-induced loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (Δψ(m)) was abrogated in CALB2-silenced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CALB2 silencing decreased 5-FU-induced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> and smac release from the mitochondria and also decreased 5-FU-induced activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of note, co-silencing of XIAP overcame 5-FU resistance in CALB2-silenced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results suggest that following 5-FU treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, CALB2 is involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction through the intrinsic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that CALB2 may be an important mediator of 5-FU-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, down-regulation of CALB2 in response to 5-FU may represent an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to this anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drug </plain></SENT>
