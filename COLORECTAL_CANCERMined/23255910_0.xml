<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regulators of the cell cycle such as cyclin E play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and may be correlated with prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the expression of cyclin E in stage III colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of cyclin E was evaluated in 49 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a multivariate analysis, the expression of cyclin E in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> at diagnosis was compared with various clinicopathological variables, including age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> differentiation and lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more node-positive cases in the cyclin E-negative group than in the cyclin E-positive group (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no correlation between the degree of cyclin E expression and the clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that overexpression of cyclin E does not predict the clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677949" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer stage III</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Negative cyclin E staining may be associated with lymph node involvement </plain></SENT>
