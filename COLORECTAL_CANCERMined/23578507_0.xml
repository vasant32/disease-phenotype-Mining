<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 400 cases were randomly collected from 1798 CRC patients treated at our hospital from January 2000 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review was undertaken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identified cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> features, TNM stage was obtained from medical records and pathological forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other relevant data were as follows: (1) initial symptom complex, (2) presenting symptom or symptom complex, (3) patient duration: period from initial symptoms to consulting a doctor, (4) hospitalization duration: period from initial seeing a doctor to a confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> case, (5) diagnostic duration: patient duration plus hospitalization duration, (6) rate of misdiagnosis: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects being diagnosed and treated as other diseases for at least 30 days was identified as misdiagnosis. χ(2) tests were used to compare the differences of rates of kinds of symptoms and early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 400 study subjects, the frequencies of initial symptoms in a decreasing order were change in bowl habits (170, 42.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and/or discomfort (157, 39.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (147, 36.8%) and anorectal stimulating symptoms (69, 17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And 176 cases (44.0%) presented multiple symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term health care seeking (≤ 15 d) after initial symptoms was 40.7% (159/391) within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but only 25.3% (42/166) cases with symptoms of change in bowel habits saw a doctor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate was significantly lower than that of other cases (117/225, 52.0%, P = 0.000) without this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptom complex did not lead to short-term health seeking compare to individual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Above 50% cases were already in late stage (TNM stage later than IIb) as any of the above initial symptoms appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences of pathology and differentiate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were found among cases with different initial symptoms (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further analyzed the consulting symptoms: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> 179 frequency (44.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or discomfort 159 frequency (39.8%), change in bowl habits 155 frequency (38.8%), and Anal rectum stimulating symptoms 69 frequency (17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>50.8% (203 cases) consulted a doctor with multiple symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>59.9% (236/394) cases were of short term hospitalization duration (≤ 15 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, only 52.5% (83/158) in cases whose consulting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> or discomfort, lower than that in other cases without these symptoms (64.8%, 153/236) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>High rate of misdiagnosis (50.0%, 10/20) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002249'>Melena</z:hpo> consulter than others (26.8%, 101/377, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Change in bowel habits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> are the most common symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>And consulting and initial symptoms are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and hospitalization delays are seen in half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases </plain></SENT>
