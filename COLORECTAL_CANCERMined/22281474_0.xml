<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the most consistent pathological conditions in the gastrointestinal tract with advancing age is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0685938" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">gastrointestinal cancers</z:e>, the incidence of which increases sharply with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the reasons for the age-related rise in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are not fully understood, we hypothesize that aging increases susceptibility of the colon to carcinogen(s)/toxicant(s), leading to an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem-like cells (CSLCs) that express <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell markers, in the colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study demonstrates that aging is associated with increased expression of several colon CSLC markers [CD44, CD166, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH-1)] and a higher proportion of cells expressing these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aging is also accompanied by increased expression of miR-21 in colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These increases are further increased in response to the colonic carcinogen dimethylhydrazine (DMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aging is also associated with increased tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of EGFR using the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab abrogated the age-related increase in CD166 and ALDH-1 as well as miRNA (miR)-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide new evidence that aging and DMH are associated with increases in CSLC biomarkers and miR21, each of which have been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EGFR inhibition attenuates these changes, indicating a role for EGFR in age- and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi>-associated changes in CSLCs </plain></SENT>
