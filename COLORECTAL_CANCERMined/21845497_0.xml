<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify novel and reliable serum prognostic markers in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Based on cytokine array analysis, we identified soluble CXCL16 as a novel prognostic serum marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of CXCL16 were assessed in 314 CRC patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and their relationships with clinicopathologic findings, including survival, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proliferation, invasion, and wound healing assays were used to investigate the biological role of soluble CXCL16 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, by exposure of HT-29 cells to recombinant CXCL16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median serum CXCL16 concentration in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum CXCL16 levels increased significantly in accordance with the progression of UICC stage classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum CXCL16 level was significantly associated with poor survival and was an independent prognostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who underwent curative intent surgery, elevated serum CXCL16 levels were significantly associated with metachronous liver recurrence and poor survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recombinant soluble CXCL16 promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin production and induction of vimentin in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, recombinant soluble CXCL16 promoted cell growth, migration, and invasion in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified CXCL16 as a novel prognostic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative high serum levels of CXCL16 were associated with metachronous liver recurrence and poor prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Soluble CXCL16 may play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> through the induction of EMT </plain></SENT>
