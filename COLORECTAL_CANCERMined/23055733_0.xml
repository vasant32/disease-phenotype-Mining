<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nanosized maghemite particles were synthesized, precoated (with dimercaptosuccinic acid) and surface-functionalized with anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) and successfully used to target cell lines expressing the CEA, characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The as-developed nanosized material device, consisting of surface decorated maghemite nanoparticles suspended as a biocompatible magnetic fluid (MF) sample, labeled MF-anti-CEA, was characterized and tested against two cell lines: a high-CEA expressing cell line (LS174T) and a low-CEA expressing cell line (HCT116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas X-ray diffraction was used to assess the average core size of the as-synthesized maghemite particles (average 8.3 nm in diameter), dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic mobility measurements were used to obtain the average hydrodynamic diameter (550 nm) and the zeta-potential (-38 mV) of the as-prepared and maghemite-based nanosized device, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to track the surface decoration of the nanosized maghemite particles from the very first precoating up to the attachment of the anti-CEA moiety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Raman peak at 1655 cm(-1), absent in the free anti-CEA spectrum, is the signature of the anti-CEA binding onto the precoated magnetic nanoparticles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay was used to confirm the low cell toxicity of the MF-anti-CEA device, ELISA and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> iron staining tests performed with both cell lines (LS174T and HCT116) confirm that the as-prepared MF-anti- CEA is highly specific for CEA-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, transmission electron microscopy analyses show that the association with anti-CEA seems to increase the number of LS174T cells with internalized maghemite nanoparticles, whereas no such increase seems to occur in the HCT116 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the MF-anti-CEA sample is a biocompatible device that can specifically target CEA, suggesting its potential use as a theragnostic tool for CEA-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, micrometastasis, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-circulating cells </plain></SENT>
