<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Studies have indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is associated with a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine the effect of diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on the formation of azoxymethane (AOM)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32149">sodium sulfate</z:chebi> (DSS)-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e> and to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>-related mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male A/J mice were placed on either a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% of total calories from fat) or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (ND; 15% of calories from fat) for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumors</z:e>, AOM was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, followed by two cycles of DSS supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Study results indicated that the HFD group had twofold higher numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e>, as compared with the ND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HFD group also had significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004324'>increased body weight</z:hpo> and epididymal fat weight, which were associated with increases of serum insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, epididymal fat pad leptin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and colonic leptin receptor (Ob-R) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals on HFD showed higher expressions of Ob-R, insulin receptor, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases, Bcl-xL and Cyclin D1 proteins in the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HFD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> facilitates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> formation, possibly by regulating downstream targets of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e>-related factors via receptor-mediated signaling of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway </plain></SENT>
