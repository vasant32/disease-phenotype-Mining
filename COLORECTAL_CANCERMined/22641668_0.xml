<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amphiregulin is the most enhanced EGFR ligand in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the expression of Amphiregulin using immunohistochemical staining in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and the correlations between prognosis and various clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined 174 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, from January 2002 to December 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amphiregulin was positive in 156 (90%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amphiregulin was found to be an independent predictor of overall survival [hazard ratio=6.25 (95% confidence interval=1.3-111.5; p=0.0144)] and relapse-free survival [hazard ratio=6.94 (95% confidence interval=1.5-123.2; p=0.0075)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the expression of Amphiregulin in a primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> is useful as an indicator of prognosis and as a predictor of recurrence </plain></SENT>
