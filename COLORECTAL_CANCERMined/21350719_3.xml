<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and six consecutive patients who underwent fast-track rehabilitation program were encouraged to have early oral feeding and movement for early discharge, while 104 consecutive patients underwent conventional care after resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their gastrointestinal functions, postoperative complications and hospital stay time were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The restoration time of gastrointestinal functions in the patients was significantly faster after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (2.1 d vs 3.2 d, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients who developed complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (13.2% vs 26.9%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the percentage of patients who had general complications was significantly lower 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (6.6% vs 15.4%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The postoperative hospital stay time of the patients was shorter after fast-track rehabilitation program than after conventional care (5 d vs 7 d, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in the re-admission rate 30 d after fast-track rehabilitation program and conventional care (3.8% vs 8.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The fast-track rehabilitation program can significantly decrease the complications and shorten the time of postoperative hospital stay of patients after resection <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
