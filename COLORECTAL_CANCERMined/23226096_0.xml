<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab and panitumumab, two antibodies targeting the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are of major clinical importance particularly in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As patients may acquire resistance-mediating mutations within the extracellular EGFR domain, functional dissection of the exact binding sites of EGFR targeting antibodies may help predict treatment responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore assessed the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> recognition of panitumumab by screening phage-displayed random cyclic 7mer and linear 12mer <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> libraries on this antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phage screenings revealed two strong, potentially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-mimicking consensus motifs targeted by panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computational approach was used to map the sequences back to the potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> region on domain III of EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presumed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> regions (386)WPEXRT(391) and a biochemically similar though discontinuous region P349-F352-D355 on a neighboring loop of domain III could be confirmed as part of the functionally relevant binding site of panitumumab by site-directed mutational analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To more accurately differentiate the panitumumab <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> from the previously characterized cetuximab <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>, binding studies were performed on a broad range of additional mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this analysis revealed two large, partially overlapping functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> consisting of 17 critical amino acid positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four of these positions were selectively targeted by cetuximab (I467, S468, Q408, and H409), whereas another four were selectively recognized by panitumumab (W386, E388, R390, and T391) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In view of the clinical significance of extracellular domain mutations, our data may help guide treatment decisions in selected patients receiving EGFR-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
