<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed to apply them to the assessment of mass screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The now standard guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is already implemented in several countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We considered the innovative immunological FOBT and computed tomography colonography (CTC) as competing screening technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using biennial guaiac FOBT as the reference strategy, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of the following alternatives: biennial immunological FOBT, CTC every 5 years (strategy CTC5), and CTC every 10 years (strategy CTC10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over a 30-year horizon and from the perspective of a third-party payer, we developed a Markov model on a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 subjects at average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Close expected net benefits between immunological FOBT and CTC5 induced uncertainty in the choice of the optimal strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic sensibility analysis then suggested that below a willingness to pay (WTP) per life-years gained (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) of 8,587 €/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>, CTC10 was optimal, while CTC5 would be preferred beyond a WTP of 8,587 €/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> </plain></SENT>
