<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A phase I study was performed in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), establish a safety profile, and to evaluate pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients from two centers were treated with a three-hour ES-285 intravenous infusion for five consecutive days, every 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven dose levels were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred from 2 to 81 mg/m²/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had DLT, one each at dose levels 160, 120 and 100 mg/m²/day; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had grade 4 transaminase increases, one of whom (160 mg/m²/day) had concomitant grade 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and grade 3 bilirubin elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MTD of this regimen was not reached due to early termination of the ES-285 phase I program, but was considered to be 80 to 100 mg/m²/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other toxicities included mild to moderate asthenia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, and injection site reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses showed dose proportionality on Days 1 and 5, a wide distribution and a long half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (five with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) had stable disease (1.2-4.1 months), lasting for more than 3 months in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Liver enzyme elevations were dose limiting for ES-285 in this administration schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low antitumor activity was observed </plain></SENT>
