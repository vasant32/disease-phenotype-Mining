<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially the impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> vascularization remains largely unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The understanding of mechanisms such as early changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> metabolism is of clinical importance since there may be a substantial influence on choice and sequence of drug combinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early signals of response to cetuximab may prove useful to identify patients having a relevant clinical treatment benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of this trial is to evaluate the predictive relevance of the relative change in (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> uptake for early clinical response during short-term single agent treatment with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early clinical response will be routinely measured according to the response evaluation criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accompanying research includes cytokine immune monitoring and analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> proteins and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: The REMOTUX trial is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center early exploratory predictive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first (18)F-FDG PET-CT is conducted at baseline followed by the run-in phase with cetuximab at days 1 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At day 14, the second (18)F-FDG PET-CT is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, patients are treated according to the Folfiri-cetuximab regimen as an active and approved first-line regimen for metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At day 56, clinical response is evaluated with a CT-scan compared to the baseline analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tracer uptake is assessed using standardized uptake values (SUVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The main hypothesis to be tested in the primary analysis is whether or not the relative change in the SUV from baseline to day 14 has any predictive relevance for early clinical response determined at day 56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients are followed until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from any cause or until 24 months after the last patient has ended trial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to evaluate metabolic changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> during short-term single agent treatment with cetuximab and to analyse their potential of predicting early clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This could be helpful to answer the question if early identification of patients not responding to cetuximab is possible </plain></SENT>
