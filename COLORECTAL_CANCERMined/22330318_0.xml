<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A considerable number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients who progress on standard treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5FU), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, irinotecan and monoclonal antibodies, still have adequate performance status and desire further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">Mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) has been widely used in this context, and despite good tolerability, there are doubts regarding its true benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to assess the activity of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> in the refractory mCRC setting, we retrospectively evaluated 109 heavily pre-treated patients who received <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> as single agent or in combination for mCRC at three different institutions in two countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median patient's age was 54 years old, 57% were male and 94% had performance status ECOG 0 or 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> was used in second line in 11%, third line in 38% and fourth line or beyond in 51% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>58% received <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> combinations, mainly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed in 5% of patients and 6% required dose reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to treatment failure (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi>) was 1.7 months with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and 3.6 months on the regimen prior to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>, with a ratio between these <z:chebi fb="6" ids="52444">TTF</z:chebi> below 1 in 82% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was only 4.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) of 3.48-5.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective data represent the largest reported series of unselected refractory mCRC patients treated with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival of 4.5 months is similar to the survival expected for best supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This lack of activity strongly suggests that <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> should not be routinely used in refractory mCRC </plain></SENT>
