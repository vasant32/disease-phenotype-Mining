<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Contrary to what was thought before, a growing body of literature indicates that these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> can be precursors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these lesions, particularly those in the proximal colon, have so far been under-recognized and missed during colonoscopy, qualifying these lesions to be the main cause of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that 10%-20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> evolve through this alternative, serrated pathway, with a distinct genetic and epigenetic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aberrant DNA methylation plays a central role in the development of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This characteristic molecular background is reflected in a unique pathological and clinical manifestation different from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> arising via the traditional pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review we would like to highlight morphological, molecular and clinical features of this emerging pathway that are essential for gastroenterologists and may influence their everyday practice </plain></SENT>
