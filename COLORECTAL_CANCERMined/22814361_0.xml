<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A recent National Institutes of Health State of the Science Conference, "Enhancing Use and Quality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> Screening," cited a need for more population data sources for measurement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, particularly for the medically underserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical claims data (claims data) are created and maintained by many health systems to facilitate billing for services rendered and may be an efficient resource for identifying unscreened individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study, conducted at a safety-net health system, was to determine whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use measured by claims data matches medical chart documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors randomly selected 400 patients from a universe of 20,000 patients previously included in an analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use based on claims data 2002-2006 in Tarrant Co, TX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Claims data were compared with medical chart documentation by estimation of agreement and examination of test use over/underdocumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found that agreement on test use was very good for fecal occult blood testing (κ = 0.83, 95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.90) and colonoscopy (κ = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-0.96) and fair for sigmoidoscopy (κ = 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over- and underdocumentations of the 2 most commonly used <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests--colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing--were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of claims data by health systems to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use is a promising alternative to measuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test use with medical chart review and may be used to identify unscreened patients for screening interventions and track screening trends over time </plain></SENT>
