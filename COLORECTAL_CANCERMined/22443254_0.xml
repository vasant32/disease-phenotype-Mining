<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective audit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stent insertions in a single district general hospital between August 2003 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> caused by malignant colorectal disease and details were collected prospectively and contemporaneously onto a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stent insertion was a combined endoscopic and fluoroscopic procedure involving a colorectal surgeon and consultant radiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenting was attempted on 62 occasions in 54 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 86% and the clinical success rate 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The indications for stenting were for relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e>, palliation and as a bridge to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were complications in 14 cases (22.5%) including three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> and one perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were three cases of stent migration, six cases of re-stenosis and two stents became impacted with stool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no incidents of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or delayed haemorrhage in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience shows that stenting for obstructing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is a safe and effective method of alleviating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and impending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">bowel obstruction</z:e> and can be provided safely and effectively in a district general hospital </plain></SENT>
