<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the detailed molecular mechanisms in the process remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study further investigated whether some important molecules (caspase-3, MMP-9 and CD44) are involved in the events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PAR2-AP or FVIIa elicited time-dependent downregulation of caspase-3, and up-regulation of MMP-9 and CD44 in SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of FVIIa were TF-dependent and involving PAR2/MAPKs/NF-κB signal transduction pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the links among PAR2/MAPKs/NF-κB may be blocked for effective treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
