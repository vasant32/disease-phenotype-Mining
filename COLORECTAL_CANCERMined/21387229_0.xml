<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the older population is increasing, a better understanding of the characteristics of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> according to the age would be useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the differences of clinical characteristics of colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> between the elderly and young patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Colonoscopy database from 2004 to 2008 was retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 1510 eligible patients who underwent colonoscopy with a mean age of 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into two groups: the older age group (Group 1, aged Â³ 60 years, n = 626) and the younger age group (Group 2, aged &lt; 60 years, n = 884) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were recorded on age, gender, colonoscopic indications, colonoscopic findings, and their related histological findings and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of finding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at colonoscopy increases with age (29.4% in the older age group and 11% in the younger age group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left-sided lesions were noted to be more frequent in both age groups (66% and 67% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The chance of detecting colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> by colonoscopy was higher in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, both groups had the lesions predominately located in the left side </plain></SENT>
