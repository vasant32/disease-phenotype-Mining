<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the principal limitation is the large variability in response among different individuals due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared gene expression profiles between radiosensitive and radioresistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines to identify radiation-related molecules that can be used to evaluate the effects of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell line SW620 was irradiated with a high-energy photo beam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following radiation treatment, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was extracted from non-irradiated and irradiated cells, respectively, and gene expression analysis was performed by oligonucleotide microarray and the DAVID bioinformatics method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further confirm the results, an additional 4 CRC cell lines, COLO205, T84, HCT116, SW480 and SW403 were purchased from ATCC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The radiosensitivities of each were determined by the survival fraction at 2 Gray (SF2) of the surviving cells using the ATPLite assay, and the gene expression profiles after irradiation among the radiosensitive and radioresistant cell lines were analyzed by membrane arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationships between gene expression and patient clinicopathological features were also analyzed using membrane arrays and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from oligonucleotide microarray analysis show that 1601 genes were up-regulated (gene expression ratio of post- to pre-radiation treatment&gt;2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By bioinformatic database analysis, 30 up-regulated genes were identified as involved in DNA damage response pathways, immune response pathways and the complement and coagulation cascades pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifteen genes showed differential gene expression profiles between radiosensitive (HCT116 and SW620) and radioresistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines (SW403 and SW480) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 110 CRC tissues, we detected five genes CDC25A, VAV1, TP73, BRCA1 and ZAP70 from 15 overexpressed genes that significantly related to prognostic factors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, advanced stage, invasive depth, lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and differentiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CDC25A, VAV1, TP73, BRCA1 and ZAP70 may be novel markers for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
