<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-143 (miRNA-143) is frequently down-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and may influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoded by the KRAS oncogene has been identified as a target of miRNA-143 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the prognostic significance of miRNA-143 expression and the ability to predict patient response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents have not yet been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined 77 CRC patients who were identified by pyrosequencing to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS and were subsequently treated with EGFR-targeted therapy with the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-143 expression was measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue and corresponding non-neoplastic colon tissue by RT-PCR and its expression level was correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to calculate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates on EGFR-targeted therapy were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Down-regulation of miRNA-143 was observed in 47 out of 77 (61%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified low levels of miRNA-143 expression as an independent prognostic factor with respect to CSS (hazard ratio=1.92, confidence interval=1.1-3.4, P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was also observed with regard to PFS on EGFR-targeted therapy (P=0.031), but there were no significant differences with regard to the objective response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that miRNA-143 expression levels serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No role for miRNA-143 expression as a predictive biomarker for EGFR-targeted agents could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given its negative impact on CSS and PFS, miRNA-143 represents a novel prognosticator and a promising drug target for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
