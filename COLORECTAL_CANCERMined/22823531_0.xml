<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a population outreach program to promote screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) among average-risk insured men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In 2008, 58,440 Kaiser Permanente Colorado members unscreened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> received an interactive voice response (IVR) call followed by mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT), or colonoscopy if requested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a quasi-experimental design with staged implementation, in which a random subset of eligible members was selected each week to receive the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This design allowed the entire group to ultimately receive the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Survival models summarized time-specific comparisons of screening behaviors for members who received immediate outreach compared with those who had not yet received it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26,003 (45%) of the unscreened population completed screening, predominately due to the mailed kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the outreach effect on screening completion was 4.08 (95% confidence interval: 3.93-4.25) and adjusted HR was 3.75 (3.60-3.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of screening were seen in African Americans (HR 0.83; 0.77-0.90) and Hispanics (HR 0.84; 0.80-0.88) compared with whites, and in smokers (HR 0.77; 0.74-0.80) compared with nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outreach had greater impact among those without a primary care (HR 4.5 vs 3.0, P &lt;.0001) or specialty care (HR 5.2 vs 3.5, P &lt;.0001) visit compared with those with 1 or more visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in members after mailed FIT with IVR was almost 4 times higher than usual care, particularly in those without an office visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Targeted approaches are needed for groups at risk for not screening </plain></SENT>
