<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this research were to increase the sensitivity of anti-p53 antibody detection in the sera of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and to assist in their diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-seven non-selected Chinese with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-p53 antibodies in serum were detected by ELISA using recombinant human <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild- type</z:mp> p53 protein and hybrid phage as the coating antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations between the anti-p53 antibodies and clinicopathological parameters were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection efficiency of anti-p53 antibodies in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was increased (46.3%, 31/67) through the combination of the two ELISA methods compared with each method alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The titer of serum anti-p53 antibodies was not associated with clinicopathological parameters, but there was a significant correlation between their presence, the CEA level, and the stage of the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that combination of the two ELISA methods increased the detection rate of anti-p53 antibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This research may provide a useful method to complement conventional clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
