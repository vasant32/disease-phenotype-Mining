<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recruited individuals completed risk factors, medical, and family history questionnaires and underwent genetic testing for genotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Frequency analysis, Chi square, Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for statistical analysis methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 FAP (from 19 families) and 13 MAP (from 13 families) Hispanic patients recruited from the PURIFICAR were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the FAP cases, mean age at diagnosis was 27.6 (range 9-71 years); 67.7 % cases had more than 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and 41.9 % had upper gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Familial cancer</z:e> registries should be promoted as vehicles for detection, education and follow up of families at-risk of acquiring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PURIFICAR is the first and only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> registry in Puerto Rico providing these services to families affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333600" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial cancer</z:e> syndromes promoting education, testing and surveillance of at-risk family members, and focusing on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> prevention efforts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The fact that only 40 % of FAP patients had access to genetic testing stresses the need to promote the establishment of policies supporting genetic testing coverage by medical insurance companies in order to provide patients with the highest standard of care to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
