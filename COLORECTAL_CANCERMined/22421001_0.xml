<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study also was carried out in elderly patients to determine the efficacy and safety of the same 5-FU schedule plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (aged ≥72 years old) with mCRC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1513041" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measurable disease</z:e>, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group) ≤2, and no prior treatment were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2) plus 5-FU 3000 mg/m(2) as a 48-hour infusion every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 134 patients, of whom, 129 were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main comorbidities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (44%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (17%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ORR and disease control rate (ORR plus stable disease) were 52% and 80%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 14 months, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 9.1 and 16.3 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (16%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (11%), and grade 3 neurotoxicity (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between efficacy or safety and comorbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest phase II prospective study in elderly patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed efficacy and safety of this schedule compared favorably with those reported in this population, including regimens with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
