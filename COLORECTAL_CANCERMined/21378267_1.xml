<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no epidemiologic studies have yet directly investigated its role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> and Nutrition cohort was conducted with 1,214 incident, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases matched to 1,214 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating prediagnostic PTH and 25-hydroxy <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed dietary and lifestyle questionnaire data were collected at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between circulating PTH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate analyses [including adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration] with a priori defined cutoff points, high levels of serum PTH (â‰¥65 ng/L) compared with medium PTH levels of 30-65 ng/L were associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In analyses by sex, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk was 1.77 (95% CI: 1.14-2.75) and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.73-1.84) in men and women, respectively (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses by anatomical subsite, the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.03-2.34, and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> RR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.72-2.01 (P(<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effect modification by various risk factors was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that high serum PTH levels may be associated with incident, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Western European populations, and in particular among men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: To our knowledge, this is the first study on PTH and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The role of PTH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> needs to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
