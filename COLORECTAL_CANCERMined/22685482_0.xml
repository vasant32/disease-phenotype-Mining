<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAHs</z:chebi> were measured in personal and stationary sampling by 40 mm Millipore cassettes, for adsorption of both gaseous and particle-bound <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAHs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
