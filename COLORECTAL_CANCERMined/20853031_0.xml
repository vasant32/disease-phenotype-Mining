<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal nodal recurrence after curative resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is an uncommon and challenging problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evidence for salvage surgery is limited and remains controversial, particularly when major vascular structures are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some reports have demonstrated a survival benefit after metachronous resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346992" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">retroperitoneal metastasis</z:e> with and without concomitant aortic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic review of the literature to find evidence in favor of or against salvage surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Electronic searches of the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE database were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional papers were identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only peer-reviewed articles published in the English language were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of nine suitable studies were identified: three case reports and six larger series, of which one was a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Including our case reports, the total number of patients who underwent surgical resection that are available for review was 110 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was between 34 and 44 months and median disease-free survival between 17 and 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concomitant resection of major vessels with graft replacement was feasible with survival ranging from 19 months to 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no reported mortality associated with surgical salvage of retroperitoneal recurrence and the overall morbidity was 17-33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current literature suggests that more aggressive surgical treatment of retroperitoneal nodal recurrence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has acceptable morbidity and may be associated with an improved survival in well-selected patients </plain></SENT>
