<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening rates are low in many areas and cost-effective interventions to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently in a randomized controlled trial, a mailed educational reminder increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates by 16.2% among U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Veterans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of a mailed educational reminder on fecal occult blood test (FOBT) adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 769 patients were randomly assigned to the usual care group (FOBT alone, n = 382) or the intervention group (FOBT plus a mailed reminder, n = 387) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten days after picking up the FOBT cards, a 1-page reminder with information related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was mailed to the intervention group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was number of returned FOBT cards after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention were assessed and calculated respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses were based on varying costs of labor and supplies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 months after card distribution, 64.6% patients in the intervention group returned FOBT cards compared with 48.4% in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total cost of the intervention was $962 or $2.49 per patient, and the ICER was $15 per additional person screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analysis based on a 10% cost variation was $13.50 to $16.50 per additional patient screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A simple mailed educational reminder increases FOBT card return rate at a cost many health care systems can afford </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared to other patient-directed interventions (telephone, letters from physicians, mailed reminders) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, our intervention was more effective and cost-effective </plain></SENT>
