<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the present study, different variables focusing on quality of colorectal surgery were investigated with respect to hospital categories: university hospital - U; hospital with maximum care responsibility (with a full spectrum of medical disciplines) - M; secondary care hospital with central regional responsibility (6-9 departments) - S; primary care hospital with local responsibility (2-5 departments) - G; The primary goal of this study was to analyse the current standard of care in patients with colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000-2004, data of 47 435 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were evaluated, using data compiled in the German multi-centred observational study "Colon/Rectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinoma</z:mp>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables with respect to hospital categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the remarkable number of patients, differences between the groups were to be regarded as significant if p&lt;0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative colonoscopy (U: 70.1% M: 70.4% S: 67.9% G: 67.2) and preoperative determination of serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> markers (U: 83.8% M: 80.1% S: 81.9% G: 77.1) mainly indicate the quality of gastroenterological work-up before surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, standards established by the "German <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Association" were not met and showed significantly lower rates for primary and secondary care hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, variables indicating quality of perioperative course and outcome: rate of anastomotic leak (U: 2.1% M: 2.8% S: 2.1% G: 3.1%), rate of surgical intervention (U: 4.3% M: 3.1% S: 3.5% G: 3.1%) and mortality rate (U: 4.4% M: 2.2% S: 3.5% G: 4.1%) were in accordance with the requirements and did not differ significantly between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, an analysis of surgical and histopathological process quality (complete histology: U: 96.3% M: 93.6% S: 91.9% G: 90.9%) revealed significant differences with results being significantly lower for primary care hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is in principle no necessity to centre colorectal surgery in tertiary care hospitals as quality parameters focusing on results and outcome are comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in primary care hospitals, there are deficits with regards to process quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measures aiming to enhance in particular process quality, i. e., hospital certification or participation with quality assurance studies, are highly desirable to further improve patient care </plain></SENT>
