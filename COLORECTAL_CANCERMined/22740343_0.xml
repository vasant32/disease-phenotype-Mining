<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PREP was found to be widely distributed in human peripheral tissues and specifically in certain cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most intense PREP expression was seen in the testis, ovaries, liver, and some parts of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the cellular level, high PREP levels were seen as a rule in secreting epithelial cells and cells involved in reproduction </plain></SENT>
