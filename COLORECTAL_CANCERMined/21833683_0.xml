<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-specific scales have been proposed in clinical practice to evaluate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether there might be a discrepancy between the National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) and the Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC), the commonly used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-specific scales, in the evaluation of peripheral neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who received more than 6 cycles of first-line therapy with modified FOLFOX6 and more than 6 cycles of second-line therapy with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number and cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> administrations were 10.5 (range 6-22) and 889.4 mg/m(2) (range 484.5-1875.0 mg/m(2)), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral neurotoxicity was evaluated during mFOLFOX6 therapy and after its discontinuation using NCI-CTCAE ver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3.0 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The concordance rate of the peripheral neurotoxicity grade determined by these criteria was low: 48.8% during mFOLFOX6 and 47.3% after discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related peripheral neurotoxicity in 50% of the patients was lower when evaluated by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC for both grades 1 (P = 0.09) and 2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rate of improvement from grade 2 to 1 (P &lt; 0.001) and from grade 2 to 0 (P &lt; 0.05) after discontinuation of mFOLFOX6 therapy was higher when NCI-CTCAE was used for the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found a discrepancy between the NCI-CTCAE and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC scales in the evaluation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-related neurotoxicity and suggest that the concomitant use of NCI-CTCAE and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-NTC would be useful to maintain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy at higher quality </plain></SENT>
