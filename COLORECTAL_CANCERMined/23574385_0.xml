<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in chemotherapy, currently used anticancer molecules are unable to improve the prognosis of advanced or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854750" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent colorectal cancer</z:e>, which remains incurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transport of classical drugs by nanoparticles has shown great promise in terms of improving drug distribution and bioavailability, increasing tissue half-life and concentrating anticancer molecules in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> mass, providing optimal drug delivery to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, and minimizing drug toxicity, including those effects associated with pharmaceutical excipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> targeting may be improved by incorporating ligands for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific surface receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, nanoparticles may interact with key drug-resistance molecules to prevent a reduction in intracellular drug levels drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently published data have provided convincing pre-clinical evidence regarding the potential of active-targeted nanotherapeutics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> therapy, although, unfortunately, only a few of these therapies have translated into early-phase clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As nanotechnology promises to be a new strategy for improving the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients, it would be very useful to analyze recent progress in this field of research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This review discusses the current status of nanoparticle-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-drug delivery, the challenges restricting its application, and the potential implications of its use in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
