<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether dietary counseling, oral nutrition and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6723">megestrol acetate</z:chebi> during chemotherapy affected nutritional status and survival in patients with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methodology: Six hundred and twenty-eight patients with colorectal advanced disease were included in the study from January 2000 through December 2009 and divided into one of two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I consisted of 315 patients who were monitored prospectively and were given nutritional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group II included 313 patients without nutritional counseling and support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the completion of chemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were evaluated (BMI, NST, Appetite Loss Scale and ECOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: After the completion of chemotherapy, there were lower proportions of patients in Group I with a BMI&lt;20, NSTâ‰¥5, loss of appetite and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased weight</z:hpo> gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nutritional counseling and supplemental feeding temporarily halted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and improved appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improvement may have implications for patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with early nutritional support lived 19.1 months while patients in the control group had a survival of 12.4 months (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions:This study demonstrated that concurrent individualized dietary counseling and nutritional support are effective in improving nutritional status thereby lessening chemotherapy-induced morbidity </plain></SENT>
