<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess trends and recent developments in 5-year relative survival in European countries, with a special focus on age, stage at diagnosis and anatomical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subsite </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using period analysis, age-adjusted and age-specific 5-year relative survival was calculated by country, European region, stage and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> subsite for time periods from 1988-1990 to 2000-2002 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, increases were more pronounced in younger than in older patients, for earlier than for more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> stages and for rectum than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
