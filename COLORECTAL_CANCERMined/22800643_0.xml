<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify changes in the proteome of the intermediate-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell line Caco2, induced by ectopic expression of two distinct <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> proteins, KRAS(V12) and HRAS(V12), in their mutated, constitutively active form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 2D-gel electrophoresis, followed by LC-MS/MS we identified almost 200 differentially expressed proteins in pair-wise comparisons of Caco2 vs Caco2-KRAS(V12) and Caco2 vs Caco2-HRAS(V12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many of the affected proteins were unique for each pair, there were also substantial similarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transformation by the mutant KRAS(V12) gene resulted in elevated expression levels and activity of endogenous H-ras protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silencing the latter with a specific RNAi reversed several proteomic changes observed in KRAS(V12)-transformed cells, suggesting that oncogenic K-ras partly exerts its effects through endogenous H-ras activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the expression of cytoskeletal and cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> proteins, caused by HRAS siRNA treatment, correlated with a reduction in the invasive properties of Caco2-KRAS(V12) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest a novel interplay between K-ras and H-ras, with possible implications for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
