<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcome in disappearing CLMs, as few studies have focused on this topic, with conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 125 patients with CLMs treated with modified FOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab, those in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CLMs disappeared on computed tomography were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of such disappearing lesions in situ was examined on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-by-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five (4%) patients with a total of 44 CLMs met the evaluation criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median number of CLMs prior to chemotherapy was 8 (range, 2-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median maximal diameter of the CLMs was 1.8 cm (range, 1.0-2.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time-to-disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eligible lesions was 6.5 months (range, 4.5-7.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of scar lesions on the liver surface revealed no viable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two lesions were surgically resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During clinical follow-up of the remaining 42 lesions, in situ recurrence was observed in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative 1-, 2- and 3-year rates of relapse in situ were 9.1, 9.1 and 31.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given the low risk of recurrence in situ, the results suggest that the sites of disappearing CLMs may be left unresected but should be carefully monitored during follow-up, with resection an option if the lesion should recur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, to validate such a treatment strategy, further investigation with a larger series of patients is warranted </plain></SENT>
