<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that volume changes of ablation zones (AZs) on successive computed tomography (CT) scans could predict ablation site recurrences (ASRs) in patients with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> treated by radiofrequency (RF) ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: RF ablation was performed in 58 patients with 117 metastases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Metastasis</z:e> volumes and AZ volumes were measured before RF ablation, 1 week after RF ablation (t1), and every 3 months in the first year after RF ablation (t2-t5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volumetry was performed semiautomatically on CT scans by drawing freehand regions of interest in the portal venous phase on 2-mm-thickness slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ASR was defined as contrast enhancement on follow-up imaging or by a hot spot on fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proportional volume change of an AZ was defined as the difference in volume percentages between two successive time points of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative values represented a volume decrease, and positive values represented a volume increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver variability and interobserver variability were evaluated by using intraclass correlation coefficients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ASRs occurred in 15 patients with 27 AZs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An increase in volume occurred in 26 AZs (96%) with ASRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AZs without ASR showed no volume increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although proportional volume changes at t1-t2 were not predictive for ASR, subsequent volume changes were predictive for ASR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced CT-based evaluation detected ASRs in 17 (63%) of 27 AZs, 7 (26%) of 27 AZs were negative, and there was doubt in 3 (11%) of 27 AZs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intraobserver variability and interobserver variability were good (0.998 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.996-0.999; P &lt; .001] and 0.993 [95% CI 0.987-0.996; P &lt; .001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Volumetry of AZs is useful because a volume increase of an AZ during follow-up is highly suggestive of ASR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Negative volume changes of the AZ from t1-t2 were not correlated with the development of ASRs, but subsequent volume changes were predictive for ASRs </plain></SENT>
