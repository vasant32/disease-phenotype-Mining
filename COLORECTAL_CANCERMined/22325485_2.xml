<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Keap1-Nrf2 pathway has been reported to be impaired in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the status of Keap1-Nrf2 system in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines and surgical specimens to investigate the methylation status of the KEAP1 promoter region as well as expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidative stress genes, NQO-1 and AKR1C1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA sequencing analysis indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations detected were synonymous, with no amino acid substitutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We showed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> genomic sequencing and methylation-specific PCR that eight of 10 CRC cell lines had hypermethylated CpG islands in the KEAP1 promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HT29 cells with a hypermethylated KEAP1 promoter resulted in decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression but unmethylated Colo320DM cells showed higher expression levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-dC combined with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi> (TSA) increased KEAP1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These result suggested that methylation of the KEAP1 promoter regulates its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time course analysis with the Nrf2-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> response element (ARE) pathway activator t-BHQ treatment showed a rapid response within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HT29 cells had higher basal expression levels of NQO-1 and AKR1C1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than Colo320DM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aberrant promoter methylation of KEAP1 was detected in 53% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and 25% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae from 40 surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens, indicating that cancerous tissue showed increased methylation of the KEAP1 promoter region, conferring a protective effect against cytotoxic anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of the KEAP1 promoter region suppressed its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and increased nuclear Nrf2 and downstream ARE gene expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells and tissues </plain></SENT>
