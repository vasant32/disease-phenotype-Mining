<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated associations between CYP7A1 polymorphisms and fecal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi>, colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA), and UDCA efficacy for CRA prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven tagging, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in CYP7A1 were measured in 703 (355 UDCA, 348 placebo) participants of a phase III chemoprevention trial, of which 495 had known baseline fecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the placebo arm, participants with two minor G(rs8192871) alleles (tag for a low activity promoter polymorphism at -204) had lower odds of high secondary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.10-0.69), and CRA at 3 years' follow-up (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.19-0.89), than AA carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haplotype construction from the six polymorphic SNPs showed participants with the third most common haplotype (C(rs10957057)C(rs8192879)G(rs8192877)T(rs11786580)A(rs8192871)G(rs13251096)) had higher odds of high primary <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.12-4.89) and CRA (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.00-3.57) than those with the most common CTACAG haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three SNPs (rs8192877, rs8192871, and rs13251096) each modified UDCA efficacy for CRA prevention, and CCGTAG-haplotype carriers experienced 71% lower odds of CRA recurrence with UDCA treatment, an effect not present for other haplotypes (test for UDCA-haplotype interaction, P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings support CYP7A1 polymorphisms as determinants of fecal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3098">bile acids</z:chebi> and risk factors for CRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, UDCA efficacy for CRA prevention may be modified by genetic variation in CYP7A1, limiting treatment benefit to a subgroup of the population </plain></SENT>
