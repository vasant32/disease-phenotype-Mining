<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">Folate</z:chebi> intake has been inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk in several prospective epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no study fully assessed the influence of the high levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> that are frequently consumed in the United States as a result of mandatory <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> fortification, which was fully implemented in 1998, and the recent increase in use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-containing supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that consumption of high levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, the form of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> used for fortification and in supplements, has different effects on biochemical pathways than natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folates</z:chebi> and might promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the association between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> among 43,512 men and 56,011 women in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Prevention Study II (CPS-II) Nutrition Cohort; 1023 were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1999 and 2007, a period entirely after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> fortification began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate multivariate hazards ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intake of high levels of natural <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (RRQ5vsQ1=0.86; 95% CI: 0.70-1.06; P trend=.12) or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (RRQ5vsQ1=0.84; 95% CI: 0.68-1.03; P trend=.06) were not significantly associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> intake was significantly associated with lower risk (RRQ5vsQ1=0.81; 95% CI: 0.66-0.99; P trend=.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intake of high levels of total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> reduces risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; there is no evidence that dietary fortification or supplementation with this vitamin increases <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
