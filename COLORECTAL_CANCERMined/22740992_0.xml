<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule for UFT/LV has been proposed as the same schedule for UFT has been reported to be safe and have good compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have been performed with regards to the feasibility of the UFT/LV regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule were compared with those of the consecutive schedule in adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients were treated with the 5-days-on/ 2-days-off schedule of UFT (300 mg/m(2)/day)/LV (75 mg/body/day), and another 12 patients were treated with the consecutive schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule, 24 of 28 patients (86%) received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the scheduled doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the consecutive schedule, 10 of 12 patients (83%) received <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the scheduled doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean relative dose intensities for the 5-days-on/2-days-off and consecutive schedules were 0.92 and 0.87, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The toxicities were milder in the 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule compared with the consecutive schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival in patients with the 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule tended (P=0.13) to be longer compared with the consecutive schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study indicate that the 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule of UFT/LV may be feasible and cause no severe toxicities in long-term adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
