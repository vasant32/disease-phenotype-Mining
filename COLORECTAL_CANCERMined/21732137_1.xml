<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The CellSearch system (Veridex, LLC) is useful for detecting circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells (CTCs) in various <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>); however, there are some problems associated with its clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A transcription-reverse transcription concerted reaction (TRC) method, which is a PCR-based technique producing more stable and reliable results, because it is a more simplified process compared with the conventional techniques, has been introduced for detecting micrometastasis in some <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TRC method in the CTC detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the two methods for the sensitivity for CTC detection using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell line and 42 whole-blood samples from patients with advanced or metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 25 patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were enrolled to investigate the correlation between CTC detection and prognosis in both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity of the TRC method was similar to that of the CellSearch system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the patients diagnosed as CTC-positive by the TRC method than in those diagnosed as CTC-negative; this finding was similar to the prognosis indicated by the CellSearch system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, clinically, the TRC method could detect CTCs more rapidly and at a reduced cost compared with the CellSearch system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The TRC method seems to be a useful alternative to the CellSearch system for clinically detecting CTCs in patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
