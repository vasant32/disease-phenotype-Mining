<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for colorectal resection has been shown to improve short-term outcomes compared with open surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is a paucity of data demonstrating similar efficacy between MIS and open colorectal resection in the elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that minimally invasive surgery provides improved short-term outcomes in elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review of 242 consecutive elderly (≥ 65 y of age) patients who underwent either open or MIS colorectal resection for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> at one institution was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term and oncologic outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Continuous variables were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Categorical variables were compared by χ(2) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method using the log rank test for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 242 elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (median American Society of Anesthesiology score (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) scores of 3), 80% (n = 195) of patients underwent open and 20% (n = 47) had MIS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing MIS had a faster return of bowel function, decreased days to nasogastric tube removal, decreased days to flatus and bowel movement, and quicker advancement to clear liquid and regular diets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall length of hospital stay in the MIS group was decreased by 40% as well as a trend towards a 50% decrease in SICU stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was 66% decrease in cardiac complications in the MIS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When evaluating for oncologic adequacy as measured by number of lymph nodes and surgical resection margins, MIS surgery offered equivalent results as open resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no significant difference in overall survival for MIS versus open colorectal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection leads to improved short-term outcomes as demonstrated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001258'>decreased length</z:mp> of hospital stay and faster return of bowel function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there appears to be no difference in oncologic outcomes in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data, age alone should not be a contra-indication to laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
