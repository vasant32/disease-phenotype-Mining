<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This is a retrospective, longitudinal, retrospective analysis of different prognostic factors for survival in a consecutive series of liver resection for metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1998 and November 2007, we performed 89 liver resections for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis from the liver resection database was performed and the variables analyzed were related to demography, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed according to the Fong and Basingstoke scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 60.5 years and 67.4% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was localized in the colon in 73% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 68.5% the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were metachronous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The right hemiliver was involved in 46 patients (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Major hepatectomy was performed in 36 (40.2%), minor in 55 (59.8%) and combined procedures in 14 (15.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven (86.5%) R0 resections were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Morbidity was 32.6%, with no perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up was 32.5 months (range 1 to 158 months), with a median of 25.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 69.7 months and mean disease-free survival 58.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis found statistical significance for blood product requirement and margin of resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients are alive at the end of this study (45.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Basingstoke predictive index for postoperative variables showed significant differences that were not demonstrated by the Fong clinical score on prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The application of Basingstoke predictive index and Fong score with biomarkers may indicate the most appropriate therapeutic strategy in each patient with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
