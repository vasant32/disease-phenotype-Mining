<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Eighty-five patients operated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 178 healthy controls with similar age and sex were included to this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA from the patients and the healthy control cases was analyzed by a BioMark 96.96 dynamic array system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein expressions of ROCK1, ROCK2 and p53 were determined by immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: There were significant associations between ROCK1 (rs73963110 and rs35996865) and ROCK2 gene polymorphisms (rs2290156, rs10178332, rs35768389, rs10929732 and rs34945852) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no marked associations were found between ROCK2 gene rs965665, rs2230774, rs6755196 and rs1515219 polymorphisms and the risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rho-kinase and p53 immunohistochemical stainings were markedly elevated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between vascular and perineural invasions with ROCK2 or p53 protein expressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: These results are the first to demonstrate the contribution of Rho-kinase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the ROCK1 and ROCK2 genes might be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development and that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may modify individual susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
