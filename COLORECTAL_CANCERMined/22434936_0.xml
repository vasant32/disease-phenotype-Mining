<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stent is a polarized and braided network of metallic wires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathology associated with colorectal stents is yet to be described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed 7 cases involving stented colorectal segments from patients lacking clinical suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases, orientation of the specimens and stents matched the corresponding anatomic landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, the specimens lacked helpful anatomic landmarks, and orientation was possible only after correlating with the intrinsic polarity of the stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stented areas showed artifacts resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e>, including rounded cobblestones, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyps</z:e>, and simple fissures, as well as unique artifacts including rhomboid cobblestones, complex fissures, oblique fissures with remarkably straight edges, and conical fragments of tissue that appeared to float </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e> was misdiagnosed in 1 case in which the stent was removed intraoperatively and was never received </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Colorectal stents help orient ambiguous specimens and induce patterned injury that can be confused with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
