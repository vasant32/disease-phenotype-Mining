<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the CT colonography (CTC) and double-contrast <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema (DCBE) for colonic evaluation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sequential groups of consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> who had a similar risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, were examined by DCBE (n = 182; mean ± SD in age, 51 ± 6.4 years) and CTC (n = 176; 50 ± 6.7 years), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CTC was performed after colon cleansing with 250-mL <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> (n = 87) or 4-L <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (n = 89) and fecal tagging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DCBE was performed after preparation with 250-mL <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>/masses of ≥ 6 mm were subsequently recommended to undergo a colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic yield and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) for <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>/masses, examination quality, and examination-related serum electrolyte change were retrospectively compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the CTC and DCBE were positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp>/masses in 28 (16%) of 176 and 11 (6%) of 182 patients, respectively (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with positive findings, 17 CTC and six DCBE patients subsequently underwent a colonoscopy and yielded a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 88% (15 of 17 patients) and 50% (3 of 6 patients), respectively (p = 0.089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with adenomatous lesions were detected in the CTC group (<z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> [n = 1], advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> [n = 6], and non-advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> [n = 6]), as compared with two patients (each with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>) in the DCBE group (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six (3%) of 176 CTC and 16 (9%) of 182 DCBE examinations deemed to be inadequate (p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Electrolyte changes were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo>, CTC has a higher diagnostic yield and a marginally higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> for detecting colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, despite a similar diagnostic yield for <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, and a lower rate of inadequate examinations as compared with DCBE </plain></SENT>
