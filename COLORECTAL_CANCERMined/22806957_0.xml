<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, the mortality observed in a study cohort is corrected by the expected mortality hazard in the general population, which is given by life tables provided by national statistics institutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These life tables are stratified by age, sex, calendar year, and, sometimes, other demographic data (ethnicity, deprivation, and others) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in most cases, the same demographic data are not available for the study cohort and the general population; this leads to differences between the expected mortality of the general population and that of the study cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More generally, the absence of some demographic variables in life tables may introduce a measurement bias into the estimation of the excess mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present article, we used a simulation approach with different plausible scenarios to evaluate the impact of an additional life-table variable on excess mortality estimates and study the extent and the direction of the biases in estimating the effect of each covariate on the excess mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We showed that the use of life table that lacks stratification by a variable present in the excess hazard model results in a measurement bias not only in the estimate of the effect of this variable but also, to a lesser extent, in the estimates of the effects of the other covariates included in the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated this measurement bias by a population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> analysis </plain></SENT>
