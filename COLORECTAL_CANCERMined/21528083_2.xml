<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were followed up for more than 3 years after radical surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed to detect the expression of 14 pathway-related markers (p53, APC, p21ras, E-cadherin, endothelin-B receptor, Shp2, ADCY-2, SPARCL1, neuroligin1, hsp27, mmp-9, MAPK, MSH2 and rho) in specimens from these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis involving a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to determine the best prognostic model from combinations of these markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven markers (SPARCL1, Shp2, MSH2, E-cadherin, p53, ADCY-2 and MAPK) were significantly related to the prognosis and clinical pathological features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prognostic models were established through SVM from combinations of these 7 markers and proved able to differentiate patients with dissimilar survival, especially in stage II/III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the best prognostic model, the p53/SPARCL1 model, patients having high p53 and low SPARCL1 expression had about 50% lower 3-year survival than others (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SPARCL1, Shp2, MSH2, E-cadherin, p53, ADCY-2 and MAPK are potential prognostic markers in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A p53/SPARCL1 bioinformatics model may be used as a supplement to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-nodes-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> staging </plain></SENT>
