<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite the theoretical advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is still not considered the standard treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients because of criticism concerning oncologic stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at examining the short- and long-term follow-up results of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and at investigating clinical outcomes, oncologic safety, and any potential advantages of laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a database containing the information about patients who underwent surgery for stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from January 2004 to January 2012 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients who underwent the laparoscopic-assisted procedure showed a significantly faster recovery than those who underwent open surgery, namely, less time to first passing flatus (P=.041), time of first bowel motion (P=.04), time to resume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet (P=.043), and time to walk independently (P=.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery caused less pain for patients, leading to lower need of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> (P=.002) and less hospital recovery time (P=.034), compared with patients who underwent open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in 3- and 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the laparoscopic approach was as safe as the open alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic-assisted surgery has been shown to be a favorable surgical option with better short-term outcomes and similar long-term oncological control compared with open resection </plain></SENT>
