<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eligible patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) were enrolled nationwide in a prospective, population-based cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were obtained through medical record abstraction and patient surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate patient characteristics associated with visiting medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> and receiving chemotherapy and patient characteristics, beliefs, and preferences associated with receiving &gt;1 line of chemotherapy and receiving combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 702 patients with mCRC, 91% consulted a medical oncologist; and among those, 82% received chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients ages 65 to 75 years and aged ≥75 years were less likely to visit an oncologist, as were patients who were too sick to complete their own survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analyses, patients aged ≥75 years who had moderate or severe comorbidity were less likely to receive chemotherapy, as were patients who were too sick to complete their own survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received chemotherapy even if they believed that chemotherapy would not extend their life (90%) or that chemotherapy would not likely help with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related problems (89%), or patients preferred treatment focusing on comfort even if it meant not living as long (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older patients were less likely to receive combination first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient preferences and beliefs were not associated with receipt of &gt;1 line of chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients received chemotherapy even if they expressed negative or marginal preferences or beliefs regarding chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient preferences and beliefs were not associated with the intensity or number of chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
