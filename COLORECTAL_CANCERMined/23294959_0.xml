<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both diseases, while untreated, have a high degree of mortality (2,3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management of such cases is a challenge for the surgeon, who confronts multiple dilemmas due to the particularity of this dual pathological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present two clinical cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon concomitant with AAA, similar in many ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cases were successfully treated regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> excision by practicing right hemicolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each case a different strategy for vascular surgery was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first case an EVAR (endovascular aortic repair) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second case, because of the high risk of the aneurysmal sac operation, we opted for an expectation tactic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presentation of these cases was chosen due to the rarity of their occurrence as well as because of the intention to highlight certain characteristic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main controversies debated are the necessity of treating the diseases simultaneously or in two stages, their approach order and the choice of an open surgery or an endovascular technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From our experience and according to most literature, a staged therapy with EVAR in the first step is a method of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As surgical technique evolves, possibilities of endograft placement are expanding, thus, cases with more challenging <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> can be approached </plain></SENT>
