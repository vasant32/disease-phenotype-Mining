<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic bead-based fractionation coupled with MALDI-TOF MS was used to screen serum samples from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients, healthy controls, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnostic model with five proteomic features (m/z 1778.97, 1866.16, 1934.65, 2022.46, and 4588.53) was generated using Fisher algorithm with best performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Fisher-based model could discriminate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from the controls with 100% (46/46) sensitivity and 100% (35/35) specificity in the training set, 95.6% (43/45) sensitivity and 83.3% (35/42) specificity in the test set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further validated the model with 94.4% (254/269) sensitivity and 75.5% (83/110) specificity in the external independent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> group, the Fisher-based model classified 25 of 46 samples (54.3%) as positive and the other 21 as negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With FT-ICR-MS, the proteomic features of m/z 1778.97, 1866.16, 1934.65, and 2022.46, of which intensities decreased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, were identified as fragments of complement C3f </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the Fisher-based model containing five proteomic features was able to effectively differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients from healthy controls and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with a high sensitivity and specificity, and may be <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum complement C3f, which was significantly decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group, may be relevant to the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
