<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This work evaluates the ability of nanoporous silicon microparticles (NPSMPs) to capture, enrich, protect, and detect low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (LMWPs) sieved from a pool of highly abundant plasma proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average pore size and porosity of NPSMPs are controlled by the electrochemical preparation conditions, and the critical parameters for admission or exclusion of protein with a definite molecular weight are determined by reflectometric-interference Fourier transform spectroscopy (RIFTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">Sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi>-gel electrophoresis (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis of the proteins captured by the NPSMPs show that the chemical nature of the NPSMPs surface and the solution pH also play vital roles in determining the affinity of NPSMPs for target analytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is found that carboxyl-terminated porous microparticles with a porosity of 26% (pore diameter around 9.0 nm) specifically fractionate, enrich and protect LMWPs sieved from either simulated samples or human serum samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NPSMPs containing captured <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> can be directly spotted onto a MALDI plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When placed in a conventional MALDI matrix, laser irradiation of the particles results in the release of the target <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> confined in the nanopores, which are then ionized and detected in the MALDI experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a proof-of-principle test case, mass spectra of NPSMPs prepared using serum from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and from control patients can be clearly distinguished by statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The work demonstrates the utility of the method for discovery of biomarkers in the untapped LMWP fraction of human serum, which can be of significant value in the early diagnosis and management of diseases </plain></SENT>
