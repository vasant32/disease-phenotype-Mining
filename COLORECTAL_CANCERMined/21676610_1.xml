<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between 1996 and 2004 in England were identified from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registry records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative relative survival and excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> there was a very high excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in the first month of follow-up, and the excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was highest in the socioeconomically deprived groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In subsequent periods, excess mortality rates were much lower and there was less socioeconomic variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of variation in excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates was generally similar in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> but the socioeconomic difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates persisted several years longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates in the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient population were the same as those observed in the most affluent socioeconomic quintile, the annual reduction would be 360 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 336 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred almost entirely in the first month and the first year after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recent developments in the national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control agenda have included an increasing emphasis on outcome measures, with short-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival an operational measure of variation and progress in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In providing clues to the nature of the survival differences between socioeconomic groups, the results presented here give strong support for this strategy </plain></SENT>
