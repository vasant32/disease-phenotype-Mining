<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To enhance the chemoradiotherapy efficacy, the biological function of HMGB2 was investigated with respect to radiation response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HMGB2 gene knockdown cells were constructed by infecting shRNA expressing lentivirus and clonogenic assay was performed to count the radiosensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMGB2 knockdown sensitized HCT-116 and HT-29 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells to ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This could be due to an increased DNA damage and an inefficient DNA damage repair in HMGB2 knockdown cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, an exposure to radiation downregulated HMGB2 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells with an intact TP53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HMGB2 gene expression of TP53-mutant cell was not affected by irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>p53-mediated downregulation of HMGB2 was confirmed by direct activation of p53 using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">Nutlin-3</z:chebi> or by inducing p53 expression using Tet-On system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assay showed that HMGB2 promoter activity was inversely correlated with the amount p53 cotransfected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that HMGB2 is necessary to protect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells from DNA damage and efficient DNA repair and p53-mediated downregulation is a critical mechanism of modulating HMGB2 expression </plain></SENT>
