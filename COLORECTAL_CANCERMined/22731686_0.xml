<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the concordance between two individuals blinded from each other who independently collected information on the same set of patients and entered it into a colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A colorectal research nurse and a surgeon independently maintained an electronic database on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new patients admitted with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> under the surgeon over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three key endpoints were selected from the database in order to determine the agreement between the two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The κ statistic (for nominal and ordinal data) and the concordance correlation coefficient (for interval data) were used to determine the level of agreement between the two data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both observers recorded 432 new referrals during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was only complete concordance between the two databases with respect to the number of new patients and returns to theatre within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there was almost perfect concordance between the two data sets for a majority of the endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important areas of variance were in the length of stay (κ=0.78), the American Society of Anesthesiology grade (κ=0.41), emergency surgery (κ=0.36), nodal staging (κ=0.54) and time to recurrence (κ=0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study highlights a number of important areas of data inaccuracy in a prospective colorectal database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inaccuracies were due to observer bias, issues of data interpretation, or just difficulty in collecting the information accurately </plain></SENT>
