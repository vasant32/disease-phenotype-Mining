<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The substitution of isoleucine to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32861">valine residue</z:chebi> at position 105 of the GSTP1 protein results in decreased enzyme activity and hence less capability of effective detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, we investigated the role of GSTP1 I105V polymorphism in modulating the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) associated in a Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We designed a case-control study in which 86 CRC cases were studied for GSTP1 I105V polymorphism against 160 controls taken from the general population employing the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length fragment polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between GSTP1 I105V genotypes and the disease, but the Val/Val genotype was associated with an increased risk with some clinicopathological parameters (odds ratio=1.5; 95% confidence interval=0.55-4.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the GSTP1 I105V polymorphism may modulate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in the Kashmiri population </plain></SENT>
