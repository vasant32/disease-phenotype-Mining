<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Identifying various pretreatment factors that predict chemotherapy-induced toxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients undergoing treatment for their disease is crucial to optimising patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-three patients received adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5FU)/leucovorin using either the Mayo Clinic (n=42) or a weekly schedule (n=31) and evaluated for clinical toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment blood analysis included measures of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> and dihydrouracil, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) telomere length (TL), standard biochemistry and cell differential analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the first day of treatment 5FU-pharmacokinetic variables of area under the curve, half life and clearance were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These variables together with age and gender were used in univariate and multivariate analysis as predictors of clinical toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the Mayo schedule the primary toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (69%), mucositis (58%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (46%), with 70% of patients presenting with haematological toxicity â‰¥grade 1 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that haematological toxicity was predicted by short TL, high platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and low neutrophil count (R(2)=0.38, P&lt;0.0006), whereas mucositis was predicted by age, TL and PLR (R(2)=0.34, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the weekly schedule diarrhoea predominated (16%), with female gender as the only predictive factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although measures of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> metabolism correlated well with 5FU metabolism (r=0.45-0.49), they did not indicate abnormal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> metabolism in this cohort and not surprisingly failed to predict for 5FU toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short TL of PBMNC and an increased PLR were strong predictors of mucositis and haematological toxicity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing 5FU treatment in the adjuvant setting </plain></SENT>
