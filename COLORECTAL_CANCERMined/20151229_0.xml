<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifty-one patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria were enrolled in further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B stage according to Dukes classification and curative resection were inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndromes, nonpolyposis syndromes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and previous blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received ≤ 3 units of allogeneic blood transfusion and group 2 received &gt;3 units of allogeneic blood transfusion. "Cutoff" value of 3 units of blood was defined according to our results and literature data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 5 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between these groups in local recurrence (χ(2) = 0.009, P &gt; 0.05) and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (χ(2) = 0.44, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated, and long-rank test did not show a survival difference between these two groups (log rank = 0.075, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications are significantly more frequent in Group 2 (χ(2) = 4.67, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that intraoperative blood transfusion more than three units had independent influence on local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative transfusion more than 3 units was statistically independent prognostic factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overall transfusion less than 3 units of allogeneic blood does not influence the outcome of patients in Dukes B stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
