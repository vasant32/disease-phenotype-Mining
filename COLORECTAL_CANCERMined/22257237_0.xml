<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> is based on application of palliative chemotherapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When combined with targeted agents against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), it can result in significant and long-term response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE: We present a case of a 34-years old man with <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of sigmoid colon (Dukes C) with 5 years disease-free survival (DFS) after primary surgery (in 2002) and adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRI (12 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A solitary relapse in retroperitoneal lymph nodes in November 2007 was treated with retroperiotoneal dissection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX 4 (12 cycles) and targeted radiotherapy of retroperitoneal area (completed in May 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An early relapse occurred one month later (June 2008--infraclavicular area, thoracic wall and retroperitoneal lymph nodes), patient underwent first line palliative chemotherapy with XELIRI + bevacizumab leading to partial remission (PR) after 3 months and complete remission (CR) after 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab monotherapy was continued for the next 8 months up to March 2010, when a progression in the lung occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> status was confirmed, KRAS treatment was changed to the second line combination of irinotecan and cetuximab that resulted in nearly complete remission after 6 months and preservation of this remission after the next 6 months of cetuximab monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treatments were well tolerated with good quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates the current options in the treatment of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a trend to gradually use <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above listed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatics</z:chebi> in combination with anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
