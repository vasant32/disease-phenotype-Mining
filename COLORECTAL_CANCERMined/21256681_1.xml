<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that the targeted therapy as an alternative treatment showed a promising prospect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that construct a recombination non-pathogenic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), inserting a fusion gene TAT-Apoptin into this probiotic vector, as a targeted therapy strategy for patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with conventional treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, the recombination EcN containing TAT-Apoptin fusion gene is capable of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific colonization, secretary expression and efficient intracellular delivery and therefore able to reduce the incidence of side effect and promote the efficiency of treatment </plain></SENT>
