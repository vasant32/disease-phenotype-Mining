<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types have been identified, but their effect on disease risk may differ among populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To identify new SNPs associated with PCa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Polish population, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA sample pools on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 135 PCa patients and 270 healthy men (PCa sub-study) and 525 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (AD), 630 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 690 controls (AD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> sub-study) were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele frequency distributions were compared with t-tests and Ï‡(2)-tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only those significantly associated SNPs with a proxy SNP (p&lt;0.001; distance of 100 kb; r(2)&gt;0.7) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GWAS marker selection was conducted using PLINK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study was replicated using extended cohorts of patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association with previously reported PCa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility variants was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individual patients were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GWAS selected six and 24 new candidate SNPs associated with PCa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the replication study, 17 of these associations were confirmed as significant in additive model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven of them remained significant after correction for multiple hypothesis testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 17 previously reported risk variants have been identified, five of which remained significant after correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pooled-DNA GWAS enabled the identification of new susceptibility loci for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Polish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Previously reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and PCa predisposition variants were also identified, validating the global nature of their associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further independent replication studies are required to confirm significance of the newly uncovered candidate susceptibility loci </plain></SENT>
