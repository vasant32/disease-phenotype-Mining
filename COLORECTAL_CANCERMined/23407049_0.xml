<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluoropyrimidines are the mainstay of systemic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Germline pharmacogenetic markers involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> pharmacodynamics could provide individualized pretreatment tools for predicting toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Research on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and fluoropyrimidine treatment outcome has focused on intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and has yielded inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The literature on pharmacogenetics in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analysed the association of MTHFR gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of serious toxicity of first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> monotherapy and combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients treated with first-line monotherapy <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and 141 patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-irinotecan combination therapy were recruited from the CAIRO trial, an open-label phase III randomized trial, comparing sequential versus combination chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> in mCRC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were genotyped for MTHFR 1298A&gt;C and 677C&gt;T polymorphisms and analysed in both cohorts separately for the association between the MTHFR genotype and incidence of grade 3-4 overall toxicity and specific adverse events, as well as efficacy parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MTHFR 1298A&gt;C and 677C&gt;T genotypes were not associated with grade 3-4 overall toxicity, febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MTHFR 1298CC homozygotes showed a borderline significantly higher incidence of grade 3-4 diarrhoea compared with MTHFR 1298AC or AA individuals (25 vs. 5%, P=0.041) in the monotherapy cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant association was found between the MTHFR genotypes and efficacy parameters in either treatment cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MTHFR polymorphisms are not associated with toxicity or efficacy in mCRC patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
