<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: The current proposed model of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> is based primarily on CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS, BRAF, and methylation status of 0-6-Methylguanine DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) and classifies <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> into five subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to validate this molecular classification and test its prognostic relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Three hundred two patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis was performed for five CIMP-related promoters (CRABP1, MLH1, p16INK4a, CACNA1G, NEUROG1), MGMT, MSI, KRAS, and BRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation in at least 4 promoters or in one to three promoters was considered CIMP-high and CIMP-low (CIMP-H/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: CIMP-H, CIMP-L, and CIMP-negative were found in 7.1, 43, and 49.9% cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (41%) could not be classified into any one of the proposed molecular subgroups, including 107 CIMP-L, 14 CIMP-H, and two CIMP-negative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 10 year survival rate for CIMP-high patients [22.6% (95%CI: 7-43)] was significantly lower than for CIMP-L or CIMP-negative (p = 0.0295) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the combined analysis of BRAF and CIMP (negative versus L/H) led to distinct prognostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Although CIMP status has an effect on outcome, our results underline the need for standardized definitions of low- and high-level CIMP, which clearly hinders an effective prognostic and molecular classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
