<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>People with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> who are sufficiently fit are usually treated with active chemotherapy as first- or second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, targeted agents have become available including anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents, for example cetuximab and panitumumab, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor agents, for example bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of panitumumab monotherapy and cetuximab (mono- or combination chemotherapy) for Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (KRAS) <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) patients, and bevacizumab in combination with non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> chemotherapy, for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> after first-line chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: The assessment comprises a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, a review and critique of manufacturer submissions and a de novo cohort-based economic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the assessment of effectiveness, a literature search was conducted in a range of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, from 2005 to November 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or systematic reviews of RCTs of cetuximab, bevacizumab or panitumumab in participants with EGFR-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> with KRAS WT status that has progressed after first-line chemotherapy (for cetuximab and panitumumab) or participants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> that has progressed after first-line chemotherapy (bevacizumab) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> steps in the review were performed by one reviewer and checked independently by a second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Synthesis was mainly narrative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An economic model was developed focusing on third-line and subsequent lines of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic and univariate deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The searches identified 7745 titles and abstracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two clinical trials (reported in 12 papers) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No data were available for bevacizumab in combination with non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy in previously treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neither of the included studies had KRAS status performed prospectively, but the studies did report retrospective analyses of the results for the KRAS WT subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Third-line treatment with cetuximab plus best supportive care or panitumumab plus best supportive care appears to have statistically significant advantages over treatment with best supportive care alone in patients with KRAS WT status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For the economic evaluation, five studies met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for KRAS WT patients for cetuximab compared with best supportive care is £98,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), for panitumumab compared with best supportive care is £150,000 per QALY and for cetuximab plus irinotecan compared with best supportive care is £88,000 per QALY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ICERs are sensitive to treatment duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: In the specific populations of interest, there is a lack of evidence on bevacizumab, cetuximab and cetuximab plus irinotecan used second line and on bevacizumab and cetuximab plus irinotecan used third line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For cetuximab plus irinotecan treatment for KRAS WT people, there is no direct evidence on progression-free survival, overall survival and duration of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although cetuximab and panitumumab appear to be clinically beneficial for KRAS WT patients compared with best supportive care, they are likely to represent poor value for money when judged by cost-effectiveness criteria currently used in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It would be useful to conduct a RCT for patients with KRAS WT status receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan </plain></SENT>
