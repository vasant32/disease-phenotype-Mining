<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that similar performances could be observed with Magstream and OC Sensors, provided a similar cut-off (expressed in concentration of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> in the stools) is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a literature-based indirect comparison between these tests, taking into account the cut-off, the number of samples, and the way they were combined (I(2+): at least one positive sample of 2; I(2++): both positive samples; I(1): only one sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six studies conducted in general average-risk populations were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each [test]*[cut-off], positivity rate (PR) decreased and predictive positive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) increased from I(2+) to I(1) and I(2++.) For similar PR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> with OC Sensor was greater than with Magstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could be due to factors other than the test, because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> associated with GFOBT in studies evaluating OC Sensor were greater than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> associated with GFOBT in the study evaluating Magstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct comparison between Magstream and OC Sensor is needed to confirm the suspected superiority of OC Sensor </plain></SENT>
