<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical trials demonstrated that screening with fecal occult blood test (FOBT) reduces mortality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the European Community currently recommends population-based screening with FOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other screening tests, such as computed tomography colonography (CTC) and optical colonoscopy (OC), are highly accurate for examining the entire colon for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Acceptability represents a critical determinant of the impact of a screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We designed a randomized controlled trial to compare participation rate and diagnostic yield of FOBT, CTC with computer-aided diagnosis, and OC as primary tests for population-based screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 14,000 subjects aged 55 to 64 years, living in the Florence district and never screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, will be randomized in three arms: group 1 (5,000 persons) invited to undergo CTC (divided into: subgroup 1A with reduced cathartic preparation and subgroup 1B with standard bowel preparation); group 2 (8,000 persons) invited to undergo a biannual FOBT for three rounds; and group 3 (1,000 persons) invited to undergo OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subjects of each group will be invited by mail to undergo the selected test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects with a positive FOBT or CTC test (that is, mass or at least one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> â‰¥6 mm) will be invited to undergo a second-level OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary objectives of the study are to compare the participation rate to FOBT, CTC and OC; to compare the detection rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> of CTC versus three rounds of biannual FOBT; to evaluate referral rate for OC induced by primary CTC versus three rounds of FOBT; and to estimate costs of the three screening strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A secondary objective of the study is to create a biological bank of blood and stool specimens from subjects undergoing CTC and OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This study will provide information about participation/acceptability, diagnostic yield and costs of screening with CTC in comparison with the recommended test (FOBT) and OC </plain></SENT>
