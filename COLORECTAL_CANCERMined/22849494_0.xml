<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims at identifying missed diagnostic opportunities, describing events, clinical clues and most common mistakes, and quantifying delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: an observational descriptive study was performed in order to review <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two experts reviewed the case histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients from the 4th Catchment Area of Asturias diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data were analysed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: full information on 119 patients out of 143 patients was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>34.45% had a clinical missed opportunity -confidence interval (CI) 95%: 30.92-39.68- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcomes show an average of 2.41 missed opportunities and 2.61 diagnostic clinical clues per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with missed opportunities was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The total amount of co-morbidities was higher in patients with missed opportunities (2.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was the main determinant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main diagnostic key was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron-deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (46.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It produced the longest delay (300 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Not having requested diagnostic tests was the most common mistake (43.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Having at least one missed opportunity entailed an average delay of 235.8 days between the first visit to the office and the referral to a consultant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: in clinical practice, missed opportunities to start a diagnostic assessment in patients with presumptive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most significant clinical clue and the one generating the longest delay is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron-deficiency</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic delay is important and is caused mainly by not identifying symptoms </plain></SENT>
