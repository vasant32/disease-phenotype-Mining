<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, a two-step PCR enrichment workflow was used to assess 540 known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-relevant variants in 16 oncogenes for high-depth sequencing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples on either mature (Illumina GAIIx) or emerging (Ion Torrent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33365">PGM</z:chebi>) NGS platforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that the background noise of variant detection was elevated approximately twofold in FFPE compared with cell line DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatic algorithms were optimized to accommodate this background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variant calls from 38 residual clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> FFPE specimens and 10 thyroid fine-needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> specimens were compared across <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346429" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">multiple cancer</z:e> genes, resulting in an accuracy of 96.1% (95% CI, 96.1% to 99.3%) compared with Sanger sequencing, and 99.6% (95% CI, 97.9% to 99.9%) compared with an alternative method with an analytical sensitivity of 1% mutation detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 of 48 samples were concordant between NGS platforms across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> matched regions, with the three discordant calls each represented at &lt;10% of reads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, NGS of targeted oncogenes in real-life <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens using distinct platforms addresses unmet needs for unbiased and highly sensitive mutation detection and can accelerate both basic and clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> research </plain></SENT>
