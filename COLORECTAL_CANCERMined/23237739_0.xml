<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The number of studies reporting on the association between sunlight exposure, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk is steadily increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> published case-control and cohort studies concerning colorectal-, prostate-, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (NHL) and both sunlight and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> to update our previous review and to verify if the epidemiological evidence is in line with the hypothesis that the possible preventive effect of sunlight on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> might be mediated not only by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> but also by other pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> epidemiological studies suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (not intermittent) sun exposure is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal-, breast-, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In colorectal- and to a lesser degree in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels were found to be inversely associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and NHL, however, no associations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed and it is concluded that the evidence that sunlight is a protective factor for colorectal-, prostate-, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> is still accumulating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same conclusion can be drawn concerning high <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and NHL other sunlight potentiated and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> independent pathways, such as modulation of the immune system and the circadian rhythm, and the degradation of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> might play a role in reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk as well </plain></SENT>
