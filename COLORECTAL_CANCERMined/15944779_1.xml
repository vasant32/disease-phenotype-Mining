<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 429 patients who had had curative resection for stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomly assigned to a study group receiving a 14-day course of 5-FU continuous infusion (320 mg/m2/day) followed by oral HCFU for a year (300 mg/day), or to the control group receiving a 14-day course of 5-FU continuous infusion alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of background factors, no significant differences were found between the 214 patients in the study group and the 215 in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions during the treatment were more frequently seen in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But with few exceptions, the toxicities were mild and the compliance was acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate of the study group was similar to that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year disease-free survival rate of the study group was better than that of the control group in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (hazard ratio=1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.03-3.38; p=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this benefit was not seen in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement in the disease-free survival rate was demonstrated through the addition of HCFU to 5-FU continuous infusion for the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of oral fluoropyrimidine as an adjuvant for curative surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> was further warranted </plain></SENT>
