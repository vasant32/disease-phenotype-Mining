<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three polymorphisms have been proposed as modulators of TS expression: a tandemly repeated sequence (2R/3R) in the 5' UTR, a SNP (G&gt;C) within the 3R allele and a 6bp deletion in the 3' UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the influence of TS expression and polymorphisms on clinical outcome of 5-FU-treated patients we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis on 63 CRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TS expression levels were analyzed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TS coding sequence and UTR polymorphisms were investigated on DNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LOH analysis was performed to determine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A difference in disease-free survival (DFS), although not statistically significant, was observed between high and low <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels: patients with low levels showed longer DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2R2R genotype showed significantly lower expression than the 3R3R and 2R3R genotypes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other TS polymorphism was associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression or clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this pilot study indicate that the number of 5' UTR repeats is the major genetic determinant of TS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of association with other polymorphisms might be partially explained by the existence of linkage disequilibrium in the TS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data support the growing evidence that TS control may require multiple mechanisms acting in close coordination with one another and suggest that TS genotyping alone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples is not sufficient to accurately predict response to 5-FU </plain></SENT>
