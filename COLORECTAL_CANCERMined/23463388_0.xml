<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed an inexpensive laser induced fluorescence (LIF) dual-channel detection system and applied it to a ligase detection reaction (LDR)/capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) method to identify the allelic composition of low-abundance point mutations in a large excess of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> DNA in a single reaction with a high degree of certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ligation was performed in a tube with a non-labeled common primer and multiplex discriminating primers, each labeled with a different standard fluorophore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The discriminating primers were directed against three mutant variations in codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene that have a high diagnostic value for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LDR products generated from a particular K-ras mutation through successful ligation events were separated from remaining discriminating primers by CGE, followed by LIF detection using the new system, which consists of two photomultiplier tubes, each with a unique optical filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each fluorophore label conjugated to the corresponding LDR product produced a distinct fluorescence signal intensity ratio from the two detection channels, allowing spectral discrimination of the three labels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of this system to detect point mutations in a <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> sequence-dominated population, and to disclose their allelic composition, was thus demonstrated successfully </plain></SENT>
