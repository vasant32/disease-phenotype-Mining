<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: : To investigate the safety of laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections in a nationwide population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: : Although laparoscopic techniques are increasingly used in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery, little is known on results outside trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the fast introduction of laparoscopic resection (LR), questions were raised about safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent an elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection in 2010 in the Netherlands, 93% were included in the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Short-term outcome after LR, open resection (OR), and converted LR were compared in a generalized linear mixed model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We further explored hospital differences in LR and conversion rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: : A total of 7350 patients, treated in 90 hospitals, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LR rate was 41% with a conversion rate of 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for differences in case-mix, LR was associated with a lower risk of mortality (odds ratio 0.63, P &lt; 0.01), major morbidity (odds ratio 0.72, P &lt; 0.01), any complications (odds ratio 0.74, P &lt; 0.01), hospital stay more than 14 days (odds ratio 0.71, P &lt; 0.01), and irradical resections (odds ratio 0.68, P &lt; 0.01), compared to OR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outcome after conversion was similar to OR (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A large variation in LR and conversion rates among hospitals was found; however, the difference in outcome associated with operative techniques was not influenced by hospital of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: : Use of laparoscopic techniques in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery in the Netherlands is safe and results are better in short-term outcome than open surgery, irrespective of the hospital of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Outcome after conversion was similar to OR </plain></SENT>
