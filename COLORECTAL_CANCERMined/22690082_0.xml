<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE and ASCO to identify eligible studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Finally, 8 randomized control studies were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STATA 10.0 Software was used to investigate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among individual studies and to summarize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with 20 of 266 patients with loss of PTEN, 206 of 496 patients with intact PTEN protein expression had a better objective response rate to cetuximab-based therapy (RR, 4.75; 95% CI, 2.59-8.72; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PTEN positivity was associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.473-0.964; P = 0.031) but not with better overall survival (OS) (HR, 0.608; 95% CI, 0.411-0.899; P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> status, PTEN positivity did not predict a longer PFS or OS (PFS: HR, 0.707; 95% CI, 0.440-1.138; P = 0.154; OS: HR, 0.943; 95% CI, 0.646-1.377; P = 0.761) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of PTEN is related to the effect of cetuximab in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and should be considered in treatment with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
