<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In 2006, the American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> established guidelines on fertility preservation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, but recent data suggest that the guidelines are not widely followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the frequency of fertility discussions and the characteristics that influence the rate of discussion, we performed a retrospective chart review for patients less than 40 years of age with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts of patients aged 18-40 years with newly diagnosed crc presenting to the Juravinski <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Centre from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed for documentation of discussions regarding fertility risks with treatment and reproductive options available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influences of sex, age, year of diagnosis, stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and type of treatment on the frequency of discussions were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The review located 59 patients (mean age: 35 years) who met the criteria for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fertility discussion was documented in 20 of those patients [33.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 22.1% to 47.4%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the odds of fertility being addressed was higher for patients receiving radiation [odds ratio (OR): 9.31; 95% ci: 2.49 to 34.77, p &lt; 0.001) and lower by age (OR: 0.86; 95% ci: 0.74 to 0.99; p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of patients less than 35 years of age undergoing radiation treatment, 85% had a documented fertility discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant difference in the frequency of discussions after 2006, when the American Society of Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> guidelines were published (31.4% for 2000-2006 vs. 37.5% for 2007-2009, p = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Discussions about fertility risks associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment occur infrequently among young adults with newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, discussions occur more frequently in younger patients and in those undergoing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations assessing barriers and physician attitudes to fertility risk discussion and reproductive options are planned </plain></SENT>
