<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here assess the prognostic impact and prevalence of MSI in different stages in a consecutive, population-based series from a single hospital in Oslo, Norway.Patients and methodsOf 1274 patients, 952 underwent major resection of which 805 were included in analyses of MSI prevalence and 613 with complete resection in analyses of outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue was used for PCR-based MSI analyses.ResultsThe overall prevalence of MSI was 14%, highest in females (19%) and in proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year relapse-free survival (5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) was 67% and 55% (P = 0.030) in patients with MSI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively, with the hazard ratio (HR) equal to 1.60 (P = 0.045) in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The improved outcome was confined to stage II patients who had 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e> of 74% and 56% respectively (P = 0.010), HR = 2.02 (P = 0.040).Examination of 12 or more lymph nodes was significantly associated with proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsMSI has an independent positive prognostic impact on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677948" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">stage II colorectal cancer</z:e> patients after complete resection </plain></SENT>
