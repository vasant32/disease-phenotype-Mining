<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous research in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has focused on survival, recurrence, and functional outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few have assessed the decisional needs of patients or the information patients are retaining from the informed consent process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to describe the decisional needs of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> when deciding on the surgical treatment of their disease and to identify gaps in patients' recollection of the informed consent discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the use of a questionnaire based on the validated Ottawa Decision Support Framework Needs Assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was performed at a university-based academic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Assessment Center, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> treated with low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were patients' knowledge and understanding of decision and their decisional needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients were interviewed between November 2009 and July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent were male, with a median age of 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients perceived having a choice of surgical options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When questioned about the main outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> surgery, 47% could not recall a preoperative discussion of risks to bowel function, 47% could not recall a preoperative discussion of risks to sexual function, and 57% could not recall a preoperative discussion of risks to urinary function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients would like information regarding functional outcomes, body image, and the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A minority of patients desire information regarding cure rate, need for a second surgery, or the ability of surgery to treat their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients would like information that is portable and trusted by their health care team that they can review at their own time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: To avoid introducing decisional conflict before surgery, patients were interviewed at the first postoperative visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Preoperative informed consent discussions were not standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite a comprehensive educational <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> pathway, patients retain little of the informed consent discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the dichotomy between the outcomes that surgeons and patients value most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The results of this study will guide future efforts to improve informed consent </plain></SENT>
