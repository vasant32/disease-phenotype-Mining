<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile less attention is paid to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> treatment - the questions of necessity and volume of its resection are still open </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AIM of this study was to evaluate safety and oncologic effectiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> resection with D3 lymph node dissection in synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and synchronous metastatic lesion of distant organs who underwent surgical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> were chosen from prospectively collected department database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of short-term and long-term results of resections with and without extended D3 lymph node dissection and prognostic factors affecting overall survival was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From 2006 to 2011 total of 190 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> resection, 157 (82.6%) among them - with extended D3 lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patient (11%) developed postoperative complications that required reintervention, 30-days mortality rate was 2.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-year cumulative overall survival was 37%, median survival - 22 months (25 months with extended lymph node dissection and 4 months without, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed following statistically significant prognostic factors improving overall survival: metastatic lesions in one distant organ, solitary haematogenous nodes, extended D3 lymph node dissection, postoperative chemotherapy, resection of metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Removal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> with extended lymph node dissection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> doesn't increase the number of postoperative complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Performing D3 lymph node dissection favours increase of median survival and is a significant prognostic factor influencing outcomes </plain></SENT>
