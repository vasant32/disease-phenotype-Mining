<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Invitees should be provided with relevant information, enabling them to make an informed decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This may be more difficult in ethnic minority and low socio-economic status groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the proportion of informed decisions to participate in a faecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening pilot and to explore differences in knowledge and attitude across various subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Asymptomatic persons aged 50-74 were invited to a second round of a Dutch FIT-based pilot screening programme for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An information leaflet containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> information relevant to enable informed decision making accompanied the invitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Informed choice was assessed by a mailed questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knowledge was elicited through 18 items and attitude towards screening through four items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measure was the proportion of informed decision makers among participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences between subgroups were evaluated using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 5367 screening participants, 2774 (52%) completed the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Knowledge was adequate in 2554 (92%); 2736 (99%) showed a positive attitude towards screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 2525 persons had made an informed choice (91%); male gender, low education level, non-Dutch ethnicity and not speaking Dutch at home were negatively associated with having adequate knowledge in multivariable analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In FIT-based screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, the majority of responders made an informed decision to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, we did not succeed in equally providing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> population subgroups with sufficient information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Future initiatives should be aimed at reaching these groups to further enable informed decision making </plain></SENT>
