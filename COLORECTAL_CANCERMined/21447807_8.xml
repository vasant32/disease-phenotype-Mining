<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas clinical trials data indicate that hormone therapy use reduces the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, data from prospective cohort studies suggest that circulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> levels are positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A surrogate measure of lifetime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> exposure is reproductive history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between reproductive factors and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were postmenopausal women enrolled in the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study, a cohort of 214,162 individuals (aged 50-71 years) that included 2014 incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> that occurred over a mean follow-up of 8.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were used to collect data on reproductive factors, including ages at menarche, birth of first child, and menopause; parity, and use of oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to examine associations between these reproductive factors and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, with adjustment for established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age at menopause (≥ 55 vs &lt; 40 years: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.83; P(trend) = .008) and age at birth of first child (≥ 30 vs ≤ 19 years: HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.58; P(trend) = .05) were positively associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among women with no history of hormone therapy use, age at menarche (≥ 15 vs 11-12 years: HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57 to 0.94; P(trend) = .02) and parity (≥ 5 children vs no children: HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.02; P(trend) = .10) were inversely associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data support a role for sex hormones in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and suggest that greater endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> exposure may increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in postmenopausal women </plain></SENT>
