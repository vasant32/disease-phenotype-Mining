<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>98,046 cancer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in Spain in 2006, which is the leading cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in our country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main action of prevention for the LC is based on smoking cessation, the main risk factor (relative risk (RR) from 10 to 30) beside <z:chebi fb="72" ids="33314">radon</z:chebi> and asbestos exposures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basically the prevention for the BC is based on early detection, mammography remains the ultimate test because it reduces mortality, and must be done along period between 50 and 70 years old with a two-year interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality is reduced by 16% due to early detection test based on fecal occult blood (TsOH), but it's necessary to insist on changes in lifestyle (diet and exercise) as primary prevention strategies, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the most effective ways to reduce the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> today is the prevention, which is carried out mainly by the nurses </plain></SENT>
