<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have designed a novel colonoscopic imaging agent that is composed of submicron-sized fluorescent <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> nanospheres with two functional groups - peanut agglutinin (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) and poly(N-vinylaceamide) (PNVA) - on their surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> is a targeting moiety that binds to β-d-galactosyl-(1-3)-N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28328">galactosamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-β(1-3)GalNAc), which is the terminal sugar of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406916" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thomsen</z:e>-Friedenreich antigen that is specifically expressed on the mucosal side of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells; it is anchored on the nanosphere surface via a poly(methacrylic) acid (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53429">PMAA</z:chebi>) linker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PNVA is immobilized to enhance the specificity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> by reducing nonspecific interactions between the imaging agent and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The essential nature of both functional groups was evaluated through in vivo experiments using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-free and PNVA-free nanospheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imaging agent recognized specifically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> on the cecal mucosa of immune-deficient mice in which human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells had been implanted; however, the recognition capability disappeared when <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> was replaced with wheat germ agglutinin, which has no affinity for <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-β(1-3)GalNAc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-free nanospheres with exclusively surface PNVA chains rarely adhered to the cecal mucosa of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice that did not undergo the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there were strong nonspecific interactions between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>-free nanospheres with exclusively surface <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53429">PMAA</z:chebi> chains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo data proved that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> and PNVA were essential for biorecognition for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and a reduction of nonspecific interactions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, respectively </plain></SENT>
