<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3802842, located at 11q23, was identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be significantly associated with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>); however, the results of following replication studies were not always concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a case-control study and a meta-analysis were performed to clearly discern the effect of this variant in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND FINDINGS: We determined the genotypes of rs3802842 in 641 unrelated Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 1037 cancer-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a meta-analysis comprising current and previously published studies was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our case-control study, significant associations between the polymorphism and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models, with an additive OR being 1.45 (95% CI = 1.26-1.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis of 38534 cases and 39446 controls further confirmed the significant associations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genetic models but with obvious between-study <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, ethnicity, study type and whether subjects affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> could synthetically accounted for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, the cumulative and sensitivity analyses indicated the robust stability of the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results from our case-control study and meta-analysis provided convincing evidence that rs3802842 significantly contributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
