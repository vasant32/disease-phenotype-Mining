<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficiency of high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) in identifying KRAS-mutant (MUT) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We considered 50 mCRC patients scored as KRAS-WT by direct sequencing and treated with cetuximab-containing chemotherapy, and tested the correlations between HRMA findings and response rate (RR), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aberrant melting curves were detected in four (8%) cases; gene cloning confirmed these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rate (RR) of HRMA KRAS-WT patients was 28.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no response in HRMA KRAS-MUT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease control rate (responsive plus stable disease) was 58.7% in HRMA KRAS-WT patients and 25% in HRMA KRAS-MUT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between HRMA KRAS status and RR (P=0.287) or disease control (P=0.219) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median PFS (4.8 vs 2.3 months; hazard ratio (HR)=0.29, P=0.02) and OS (11.0 vs 2.7 months; HR=0.11, P=0.03) were significantly longer for the HRMA KRAS-WT than for HRMA KRAS-MUT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution melting analysis identified 8% more KRAS-MUT patients not responding to cetuximab-containing regimens, suggesting that HRMA may be more effective than direct sequencing in selecting patients for anti-EGFR antibodies </plain></SENT>
