<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, especially those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and untreated, asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients had incurable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> BRAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> with untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e>, and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (20 patients, 11%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> (14, 8%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>pyrexia</z:hpo> (11, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In Val600 BRAF-mutant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> and untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e>, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumours</z:e>, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238198" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="GIST|GANT">gastrointestinal stromal tumour</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238463" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="FNMTC|NMTC">papillary thyroid cancers</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
