<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We searched the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library and systematically reviewed the randomized controlled trials by comparing the overall complication, mortality, and recurrence rate between laparoscopic resection and open surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen trials with 4,207 patients who reported long-term outcomes of the overall complication, mortality, and recurrence rate were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined results of the individual trials showed no statistically significant difference in the odds ratio (OR) for overall recurrence (OR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.77-1.11, P=0.34), local recurrence (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.59-1.12, P=0.20), distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (OR 1.01, 95% CI, 0.78-1.30, P=0.95), wound-site recurrence (OR 1.97, 95% CI, 0.77-5.02, P=0.16), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-related mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI, 0.66-1.02, P=0.07), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-related mortality (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.66-1.09, P=0.20), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>-related mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI, 0.53-1.11, P=0.16), and overall mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.73-1.73, P=0.11) between the laparoscopic surgery and open surgery groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall complications in the laparoscopic surgery group were much lower than that in the open surgery group (OR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.58-0.87, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis showed that the successful laparoscopic colorectal resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was as effective as open surgery in terms of the oncological outcomes, thereby suggesting that laparoscopic surgery can be continued in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
