<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: HORIZON III [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX6 in Patients With Untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</z:e>] had an adaptive phase II/III design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients randomly assigned 1:1:1 received mFOLFOX6 [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 85 mg/m(2) and leucovorin 400 mg/m(2) intravenously followed by fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and then continuous infusion of 2,400 mg/m(2) over the next 46 hours every 2 weeks] with cediranib (20 or 30 mg per day) or bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 14 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An independent end-of-phase II analysis concluded that mFOLFOX6/cediranib 20 mg met predefined criteria for continuation; subsequent patients received mFOLFOX6/cediranib 20 mg or mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab (randomly assigned 1:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 1,422 patients received mFOLFOX6/cediranib 20 mg (n = 709) or mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab (n = 713) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary analysis revealed no significant difference between arms for PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.25; P = .119), overall survival (OS; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.10; P = .541), or overall response rate (46.3% v 47.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median PFS and OS were 9.9 and 22.8 months for mFOLFOX6/cediranib and 10.3 and 21.3 months for mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PFS upper 95% CI was outside the predefined noninferiority limit (HR &lt; 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Common adverse events with more than 5% incidence in the cediranib arm included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cediranib-treated patients completed fewer chemotherapy cycles than bevacizumab-treated patients (median 10 v 12 cycles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were significantly less favorable in cediranib-treated versus bevacizumab-treated patients (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cediranib activity, in terms of PFS and OS, was comparable to that of bevacizumab when added to mFOLFOX6; however, the predefined boundary for PFS noninferiority was not met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cediranib safety profile was consistent with previous studies but led to less favorable PROs compared with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
