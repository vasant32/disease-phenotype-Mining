<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE:: Research suggests that recurrence and survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are worse in men than in women but the causes for this are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to (1) assess for sex differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) within a large, contemporary population-based sample in California; and (2) examine the impact of income, education, and insurance status on sex differences in CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Screening-eligible patients were identified from the 2007 US California Health Interview Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Up-to-date, CRCS was defined as fecal occult blood test within 1 year, flexible sigmoidoscopy within 5 years, or colonoscopy within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between sex and CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses on the basis of self-reported income (low vs. high), education (â‰¤ high school vs. &gt; high school), and health insurance status (insured vs. uninsured) were performed to determine if sex differences in screening were modified by these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: In total, 11,260 men and 17,705 women were identified: mean ages were 65 and 66 years, respectively, and 63% were white in both the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the entire cohort, only two thirds of men and women reported undergoing up-to-date CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women had decreased odds of CRCS than men, after adjusting for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses indicated that sex disparities in CRCS persisted among the insured, educated, and high-income earners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Women are less likely to undergo CRCS than men, but poor health care access is associated with low CRCS in both the sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conventional strategies aimed at improving health care access should also include sex-specific interventions that raise awareness about preventive care to most effectively optimize CRCS </plain></SENT>
