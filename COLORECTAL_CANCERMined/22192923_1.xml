<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because clinical criteria for LS, such as the Amsterdam II Criteria, may miss cases, reflex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue testing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients for LS has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study describes the impact of routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue for loss of MMR protein expression in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A prospective institutional program was established to perform IHC analysis on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> (â‰¤50 years) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal IHC analysis were referred to the Clinical Genetics Service for further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study cohort excluded patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> syndromes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IHC was performed on 198 patients from July 2006 to June 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age was 42.8 years (range 23.1 to 50.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal IHC was reported in 38 (19.1%) patients, and 22 (57.8%) with abnormal IHC analysis had germline genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (77.2%) had an alteration detected in an MMR gene: 10 were known to be deleterious mutations and 7 were variants of uncertain significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, LS was detected in 5.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of the 10 (20%) with a deleterious mutation actually met the Amsterdam II Criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reflex IHC testing for LS on early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age-of-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients undergoing resection is feasible at the institutional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This strategy identifies a substantial number of LS patients who would have been missed if genetic testing was based on the Amsterdam II Criteria alone </plain></SENT>
