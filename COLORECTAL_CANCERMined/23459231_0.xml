<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since intestinal-type <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (ITAC) of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus has morphologic and phenotypic features that are usually indistinguishable from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), it is likely that both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types share equivalent genetic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from a series of 43 patients treated surgically for ITAC in Montpellier, France between November 1998 and December 2012 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were characterized for mutations in KRAS and BRAF as well as EGFR overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed using overall survival as the primary end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient survival was analyzed using the hazards ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (63%) showed EGFR positivity and 30% exhibited a high expression level (+2/+3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were detected in 43% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutations were identified in 3.6% of specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with age superior to 60 years, metastatic status, and KRAS mutations had significant overall survival values (p = 0.026, p = 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that KRAS mutations and EGFR expression are frequent in ITAC and that KRAS mutations predict good patient prognosis in ITAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, EGFR directed molecular treatments could be investigated in a subset of patients affected by ITAC </plain></SENT>
