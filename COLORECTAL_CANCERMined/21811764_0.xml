<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that ABL can inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and neointima formation after balloon injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABL also shows chemopreventive properties by inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>, but the antitumor activity and the molecular targets of ABL in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells have not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that ABL inhibits the growth in dose- and time-dependent manners by inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase of HT-29 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suppression was accompanied by a strong decrease of cyclin E and CDK4 protein levels, and an increase in p21 protein expression in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that ABL-induced growth inhibition is associated with the upregulation of KLF4 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of KLF4 by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with pAd-KLF4 resulted in growth inhibition, with decrease in the protein levels of cyclin E and CDK4, and increase in the expression of p21, similarly to the effects of ABL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, knockdown of KLF4 using a specific siRNA impaired the ABL-induced growth inhibition in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that KLF4 as an important cellular target of ABL mediates the growth inhibition of HT-29 cells induced by ABL via upregulation of p21 expression </plain></SENT>
