<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean number of ACF per rat in the case of the four groups fed a fat-rich diet tended to be higher than that of the four groups being fed a standard diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the increase in the mean number of ACF per rat only reached statistical significance in the case of the rats receiving a fat-rich lab chow supplemented with 50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a concentration of 0.1 ppm PhIP per se, either in the standard or in the fat-rich lab chow, did not lead to an increase in the mean number of ACF per rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study provides additional evidence for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> promoting effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation when rodents are fed the compound in supraphysiological concentrations </plain></SENT>
