<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and of African-American ethnicity are known to be at higher risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine if there is a lack of physician knowledge for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening guidelines based on family history and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between February and April 2009 an anonymous web-based survey was administered to a random sample selected from a national list of 25,000 internists, family physicians and gastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A stratified sampling strategy was used to include practitioners from states with high as well as low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> data analyses were performed following data collection in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average knowledge score was 37 Â± 18% among the 512 respondents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gastroenterologists averaged higher scores compared to internists, and family physicians, p = 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 28% of physicians correctly identified the screening initiation point for African-Americans while only 12% of physicians correctly identified the screening initiation point and interval for a patient with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most commonly cited barriers to referring high-risk patients for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were "patient refusal" and "lack of insurance reimbursement." CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of knowledge amongst physicians of the screening guidelines for high-risk populations, based on family history and ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Educational programs to improve physician knowledge and to reduce perceived barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening are warranted to address health disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
