<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: There is controversy over whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> as the only symptom should be an indication for routine diagnostic colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out to assess the prevalence of abnormal pathology on colonoscopy and to assess the risk factors for colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> but without 'high risk symptoms' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A cross-sectional, single-centre study was conducted on individuals who underwent colonoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> as the sole indication between 2005 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized endoscopic and pathology reports were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 786 patients (595 women, 75.7%; mean age, 57.4Â±13.5 years) underwent diagnostic colonoscopy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-three (5.5%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, of whom 19 (2.4%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> and 19 (2.4%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, the detection rate was 2.9% for patients below age 40 years and 1.7% for patients below age 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older age was associated with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> in both univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gender, ethnicity and smoking were not associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> as the sole indication had a lower yield of neoplastic lesions than that for patients undergoing routine screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo> may only be warranted in patients who are over 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
