<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that strict asepsis in closing wounds following laparotomy reduces the risk for surgical wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted from June 1, 2009, through June 1, 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS: Colorectal surgery units of 9 Spanish hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 969 patients who underwent elective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery were eligible for randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In closing the laparotomy wound, the patients were randomized to 2 groups: conventional (n=516) and new operation (n=453) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the conventional group, a new set of instruments was used, surgical staff changed their gloves, and the surgical drapes surrounding the laparotomy were covered by a new set of drapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The new operation group involved removing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> drapes, the surgical staff scrubbed again, and a new set of drapes and instruments was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incisional (superficial and deep) surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> 30 days after the operation and risk factors for postoperative wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 146 incisional surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (15.1%) were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 96 (9.9%) were superficial and 50 (5.1%) were deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On an intent-to-treat basis, significant differences were found between both groups (66 [12.8%] in the conventional group vs 80 [17.7%] in the new operation group [P=.04]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study does not support the use of rescrubbing to reduce the incidence of incisional surgical site <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
