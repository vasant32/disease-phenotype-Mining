<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is a leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> mortality, yet effective screening tests are often underused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electronic patient messages and personalized risk assessments delivered via an electronic personal health record could increase screening rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 14 ambulatory health centers involving 1103 patients ranging in age from 50 to 75 years with an active electronic personal health record who were overdue for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single electronic message highlighting overdue screening status with a link to a Web-based tool to assess their personal risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcomes included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates at 1 and 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Screening rates were higher at 1 month for patients who received electronic messages than for those who did not (8.3% vs 0.2%, P &lt; .001), but this difference was no longer significant at 4 months (15.8% vs 13.1%, P = .18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 552 patients randomized to receive the intervention, 296 (54%) viewed the message, and 47 (9%) used the Web-based risk assessment tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 296 intervention patients who viewed the electronic message, risk tool users were more likely than nonusers to request screening examinations (17% vs 4%, P = .04) and to be screened (30% vs 15%, P = .06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One-fifth of patients (19%) using the risk assessment tool were estimated to have an above-average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Electronic messages to patients produce an initial increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening rates, but this effect is not sustained over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01032746 </plain></SENT>
