<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous PMS2 germline mutations are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Up to one third of these mutations are genomic deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their detection is complicated by a pseudogene (PMS2CL), which--owing to extensive interparalog sequence exchange--closely resembles PMS2 downstream of exon 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recently redesigned multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay identifies PMS2 copy number alterations with improved reliability when used with reference DNAs containing equal numbers of PMS2- and PMS2CL-specific sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected eight such reference samples--<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> publicly available--and used them with this assay to study 13 patients with PMS2-defective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three presented deleterious alterations: an Alu-mediated exon deletion; a 125-kb deletion encompassing PMS2 and four additional genes (two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressing functions); and a novel deleterious hybrid PMS2 allele produced by recombination with crossover between PMS2 and PMS2CL, with the breakpoint in intron 10 (the most 5' breakpoint of its kind reported thus far) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We discuss mechanisms that might generate this allele in different chromosomal configurations (and their diagnostic implications) and describe an allele-specific PCR assay that facilitates its detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the redesigned PMS2 MLPA assay is a valid first-line option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our series, it identified roughly a quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PMS2 mutations </plain></SENT>
