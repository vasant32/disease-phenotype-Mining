<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective: To assess FDG-PET diagnostic accuracy on detection of recurrent hepatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE, we performed a patient-based diagnostic meta-analysis of post-RFA FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across nine included articles, independent, random-effects sensitivity and specificity were 0.73(0.50-0.88) and 0.85(0.72-0.93), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A symmetrical SROC curve was produced with no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specificity was optimal for surgical RFA and colorectal origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Synthesis of published evidence suggests PET/CT as an appropriate tool for optimizing post-ablation follow-up </plain></SENT>
