<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, few studies have assessed differences among Asian subgroups.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify patients with invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between 1988 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in clinicopathologic features, and DSS rates were compared among Asian subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The California Health Interview Survey was used to examine risk factors and screening patterns for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>.Results:The study included 359â€‰374 patients with 8.4% Asian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Asian subgroups were younger (median: 68 years) at diagnosis than non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients (median: 72 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most Asian subgroups, except Hawaiians, had better DSS than NHW patients although Asian subgroups had more advanced disease than NHW </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> proportions were lower in Asian subgroups (&lt;50.2%) than in NHW (59.8%) </plain></SENT>
