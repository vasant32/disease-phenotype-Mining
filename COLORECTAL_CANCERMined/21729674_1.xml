<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> runs a more severe course in blacks compared with whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Black patients tend to have more advanced disease at diagnosis and are more likely to die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than are white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was carried out to compare the characteristics and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in blacks and whites in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where patients are expected to receive similar treatment irrespective of race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The database of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center was searched for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a histologic diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> diagnosed since 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed information on patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition the type of treatment and outcome was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 300 subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They comprised 205 white and 95 black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in age at presentation between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blacks were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P = .005) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001) than were whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However there was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to the histologic grade of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, the extent of disease at presentation, the proportion of patients receiving curative surgery, and the time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no racial difference in the treatment outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in patients treated at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that if patients receive similar treatment, the racial background of an individual does not have any impact on the severity of disease at presentation and the outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
