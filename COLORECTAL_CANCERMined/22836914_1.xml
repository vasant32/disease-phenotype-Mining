<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined factors influencing the choice of participants between colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) in a screening program and the impact of an unbiased educational session on influencing this decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 7,845 participants who underwent screening between May 2008 and April 2011 was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression and multinomial regression were performed to calculate the odds of selection of colonoscopy instead of FIT and the impact of the educational session on final participant choice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 7,845 participants, 4,796 (61 %) underwent FIT and 3,049 (39 %) underwent colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant number of participants changed their initial choice after the educational session, with 27.1 % changing to FIT from colonoscopy and 8 % changing from FIT to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, educational level, occupation, income, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, perception of risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and perceptions regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were significantly different among the groups choosing FIT and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and high self-perception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk resulted in higher odds of choosing colonoscopy, whereas older age, single marital status, and negative perception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening resulted in lower odds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perceptions of overall health status, occupation, low income, younger age, and negative perceptions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were associated with higher odds of change in screening choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Those at higher odds of changing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening options should be supported with more detailed explanations by primary care physicians to secure a more informed and considered choice </plain></SENT>
