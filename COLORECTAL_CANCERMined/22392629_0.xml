<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient navigation targets medically underserved with the objective of reducing the time interval between an abnormal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> finding, diagnostic resolution, and treatment initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors assessed the incremental cost effectiveness of adding patient navigation to standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care in 3 community hospitals in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to assess the cost effectiveness of a colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patient navigation program over the period of 1 year compared with standard care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data sources included published estimates in the literature and primary costs, aggregate patient demographics, and outcome data from 3 patient navigation programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 1 year, compared with standard care alone, it was estimated that offering patient navigation with standard care would allow an additional 78 of 959 individuals with an abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening and an additional 21 of 411 individuals with abnormal colonoscopies to reach timely diagnostic resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without including medical treatment costs saved, the cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $511 to $2080 per <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnostic resolution achieved and from $1192 to $9708 per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnostic resolution achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that implementing breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patient navigation in community hospital settings in which low-income populations are served may be a cost-effective addition to standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care in the United States </plain></SENT>
