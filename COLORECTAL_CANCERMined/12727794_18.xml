<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> H synthase, has been found in several human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This appears as a rationale for the chemopreventive effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the reason for COX-2 overexpression is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cell culture experiments, COX-2 can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A crucial step in this signalling pathway is thought to be activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we hypothesized an association between COX-2 overexpression and expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and the NF-kappaB subunit p65 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemistry for the respective antigens on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens, obtained by surgical resections from 21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical results were confirmed by examination of protein levels in tissue lysates and nuclear extracts using western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-neoplastic tissue specimens resected well outside the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> border served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 expression was found to be markedly enhanced in the neoplastic epithelium compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was paralleled by a significantly higher expression of IL-1beta, IL-6 and p65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serial sections revealed consistent cellular colocalizations of respective antigens in the neoplastic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistically, a significant correlation between expression of COX-2 and IL-1beta, IL-6 and p65 was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparable results were obtained for stromal cells like macrophages and myofibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further examination of nuclear extracts from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specimens by western blotting confirmed a higher content of p65 protein compared with non-neoplastic control tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our study provides evidence for an association between expression of COX-2 and IL-1beta, IL-6 and p65 in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with the thesis that proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-6 may be accountable for the overexpression of COX-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Finally, the study corroborates a role for NF-kappaB in the control of COX-2 gene transcription in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Given an antiapoptotic role for COX-2 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> cells, inhibition of NF-kappaB may offer an important strategy to interfere with the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
