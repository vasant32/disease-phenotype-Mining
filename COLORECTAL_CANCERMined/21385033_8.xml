<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When used as features for classification, such coordinately dysregulated subnetworks improve diagnosis and prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> considerably over single-gene markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, existing methods formulate coordination between multiple genes through additive representation of their expression profiles and utilize fast heuristics to identify dysregulated subnetworks, which may not be well suited to the potentially combinatorial nature of coordinate dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose a combinatorial formulation of coordinate dysregulation and decompose the resulting objective function to cast the problem as one of identifying subnetwork state functions that are indicative of phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on this formulation, we show that coordinate dysregulation of larger subnetworks can be bounded using simple statistics on smaller subnetworks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then use these bounds to devise an efficient algorithm, Crane, that can search the subnetwork space more effectively than existing algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive cross-classification experiments show that subnetworks identified by Crane outperform those identified by additive algorithms in predicting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
