<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of pharmacokinetically (PK) guided fluorouracil (5-FU) dose adjustment vs. standard body-surface-area (BSA) dosing in a FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) regimen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 118 patients with mCRC were administered individually determined PK-adjusted 5-FU in first-line FOLFOX chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparison arm consisted of 39 patients, and these patients were also treated with FOLFOX with 5-FU by BSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the PK-adjusted arm 5-FU was monitored during infusion, and the dose for the next cycle was based on a dose-adjustment chart to achieve a therapeutic area under curve range (5-FU(ODPM Protocol)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The objective response rate was 69.7% in the PK-adjusted arm, and median overall survival and median progression-free survival were 28 and 16 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the traditional patients who received BSA dosage, objective response rate was 46%, and overall survival and progression-free survival were 22 and 10 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3/4 toxicity was 1.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, 0.8% for mucositis, and 18% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in the dose-monitored group; they were 12%, 15%, and 25%, respectively, in the BSA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and tolerability of PK-adjusted FOLFOX dosing was much higher than traditional BSA dosing in agreement with previous reports for 5-FU monotherapy PK-adjusted dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these results suggests that PK-guided 5-FU therapy offers added value to combination therapy for mCRC </plain></SENT>
