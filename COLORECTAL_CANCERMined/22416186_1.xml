<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2002 and June 2010, 40 patients in South Korea with MCRC who were treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as a second or later-line treatment were analyzed retrospectively for their overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had progressed under prior chemotherapy without bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (7.5%) exhibited an ORR, twenty one patients (52.5%) exhibited stable disease (SD), and fifteen patients (37.5%) exhibited disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of the OS and PFS were 14.0 mo and 6.13 mo respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median OSs were 16.60, 14.07 and 13.00 mo for second-line, third-line and fourth- or later-line treatments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median PFSs were 7.23, 7.30 and 3.87 mo for the second-line, third-line and fourth- or later-line treatments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with MCRC, bevacizumab combined chemotherapy may be beneficial during second- or later-line treatment </plain></SENT>
