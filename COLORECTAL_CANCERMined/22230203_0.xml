<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nurse-led telephone follow-up is effective in meeting information and psycho-social needs in other patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We explored the potential benefits of nurse-led telephone follow-up for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty-five patients were randomized to either telephone or hospital follow-up in an exploratory randomized trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The telephone intervention was deliverable in clinical practice and acceptable to patients and health professionals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five per cent of eligible patients agreed to randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High levels of satisfaction were evident in both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appointments in the hospital group were shorter (median 14.0 min, range 2.3-58.0) than appointments in the telephone group (median 28.9â€ƒmin, range 6.1-48.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in the telephone arm were more likely to raise concerns during consultations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Historical approaches to follow-up unsupported by evidence of effectiveness and efficiency are not sustainable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Telephone follow-up by specialist nurses may be a feasible option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A main trial comparing hospital and telephone follow-up is justified, although consideration needs to be given to trial design and practical issues related to the availability of specialist nurses at study locations </plain></SENT>
