<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a prospective observation study, blood samples were taken from 49 consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> before, 24 and 48 hr after RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), receptor of glycation end products (RAGE) and activity of desoxyribonuclease were compared with response to therapy regularly determined radiologically 3 months after therapy and with overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of HMGB1 were increased already 24 hr after RE, while RAGE levels were decreased and DNAse remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In radiological staging, 35 patients demonstrated disease progression while 14 patients had stable disease or remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum HMGB1 levels 24 hr after RE were significantly higher in progressive than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> patients while for RAGE and DNAse no difference was observed between the response groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning overall survival, high pretherapeutic (0 hr) and 24 hr levels of HMGB1 were associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
