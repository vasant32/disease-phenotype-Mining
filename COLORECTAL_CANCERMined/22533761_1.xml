<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EGC</z:e>), which provides a higher complete resection rate than conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), has rapidly come into widespread use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, colorectal ESD is not widely used because of its technical difficulty and complications such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and the procedure time is longer than that of conventional EMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Development of safer and more reliable devices as well as technique modifications are therefore required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study is to compare safety and efficacy of a new traction method, the cross-counter technique, for large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> combined with a balloon overtube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 30 patients with large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> were analyzed retrospectively; 15 patients for the cross-counter technique group (CC group) and 15 patients for the no-traction group (NT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure time, complete resection rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedure time was 126 ± 42.2 min and 165 ± 61.3 min in the CC and NT groups, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in complete resection rate, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rate and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rate between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cross-counter technique shortened the treatment time in colorectal ESD without any complication </plain></SENT>
