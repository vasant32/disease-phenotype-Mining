<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted a prospective study, on 107 patients diagnosed with stage III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients follow-up included: history and physical examination, CEA determination, and abdomino-pelvic US every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Recurrent disease</z:e> was observed in 36% of cases after a median follow-up interval of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The liver was the most frequent isolated site of disease recurrence (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum CEA level increased in most patients (69%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, a high percentage of relapses was diagnosed by routine abdominal US (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the benefit of intense follow-up (CEA, abdominal US) after curative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
