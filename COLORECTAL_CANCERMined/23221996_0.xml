<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous agents against HER3 are in clinical development despite variable data for the prognostic impact of HER3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report a meta-analysis of the association of HER3 expression and survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PubMed was searched for studies evaluating expression of HER3 (as measured by immunohistochemistry) and overall survival (OS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Published data were extracted and computed into odds ratios (ORs) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 3 and 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effect model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> statistical tests were two-sided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis included 12 studies: three that evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, two that evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo>, two that evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and one each that evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with HER3 overexpression was 42.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HER3 was associated with worse OS at both 3 years (OR = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.77 to 2.83, P &lt; .001) and 5 years (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.75 to 2.76, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among studies with common HER2 overexpression (breast, gastric, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e>), the magnitude of effect of HER3 on OS was statistically significantly greater for both 3-year OS (OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.24 to 4.37) and 5-year OS (OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 2.09 to 3.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression of HER3 is associated with worse survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The influence of HER3 may be greater in those <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> where HER2 is commonly overexpressed </plain></SENT>
