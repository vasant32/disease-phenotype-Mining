<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fecal occult blood test is currently the first line method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening but has an unacceptably low sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved screening tests are therefore urgently required for early stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have described a hypothesis-driven approach for a rapid biomarker discovery process whereby selected proteins previously implicated as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>-associated proteins (CCAP), which can potentially be shed into the feces from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e>, are targeted for excision from 1D-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE based on their predicted molecular weight followed by directed identification and relative quantification using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach can significantly reduce the time for clinical assay development with the added advantage that many proteins will have been validated by previous in vitro and/or in vivo studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty potential CCAPs were selected from the literature and appropriate MRM conditions were established for measurement of proteotypic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of these proteins were detected in the feces from a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative quantitation of these 19 CCAP across 5 CRC patients and 5 healthy volunteers were carried out, revealing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, myeloperoxidase, S100A9, filamin A and l-plastin to be present only in the feces of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
