<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: English <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> policy has encouraged primary care trusts (PCTs) to consider their 1-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study quantifies variation in these estimates across 39 PCTs in the London and South East Coast strategic health authorities, and explores their precision, possible confounding by age and bias due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate only (DCO) registrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One-year relative survival estimates and data on DCO registrations for patients diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> between 2002 and 2006 were extracted from the UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Information Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct age standardization was performed with weightings derived from the standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patient population for Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pearson correlation coefficients between survival estimates and DCO proportions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean 1-year PCT survival estimates ranged from 6.9 to 19.4 percentage points, and the precision of individual estimates ranged from ±0.9 to ±6.5 percentage points (at 95% confidence level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age standardization significantly changed the estimates of nine PCTs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, five PCTs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> and three PCTs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> estimates were affected significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DCO proportions were positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> survival and negatively associated with colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PCT 1-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival estimates may be informative, but caveats relating to data quality and hence the validity of the estimates means that they require careful investigation before naïve use, as random variation, confounding due to age and bias due to DCO registrations may be significant </plain></SENT>
