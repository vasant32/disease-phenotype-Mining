<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although it has been well established that galectin-4 is selectively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, the role of galectin-4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) development is, as yet, poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we aimed to explore the role of galectin-4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> development, both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Galectin-4 expression was investigated in tissue specimens from patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e>-derived HT-29 cells, in which galectin-4 expression was knocked down, were established using shRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression levels of galectin-4 and several downstream <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes were analyzed using RT-PCR, qPCR array, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effect of galectin-4 expression abrogation on <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in vivo, xenograft assays were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry analyses showed high expression levels of galectin-4 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the expression levels of galectin-4 were significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> samples and its precursor lesions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that shRNA-mediated galectin-4 silencing increases cell proliferation and, concomitantly, activates NF-κB and STAT3 signaling along with IL-6 up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that shRNA-mediated galectin-4 silencing promotes the expression of NF-κB target genes and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related genes and, concomitantly, enhances the in vivo growth of xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that abrogation of galectin-4 expression promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell proliferation and, for the first time, provide evidence that down-regulation of galectin-4 elicits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519689" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor promotion</z:e> in vitro and in vivo through activation of IL-6/NF-κB/STAT3 signaling </plain></SENT>
