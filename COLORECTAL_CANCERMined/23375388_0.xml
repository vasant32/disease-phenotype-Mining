<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent discoveries expand the homeostatic role of GUCY2C to reveal a novel gut-brain <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> axis regulating appetite, anchored by hypothalamic GUCY2C which is responsive to intestine-derived uroguanylin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, GUCY2C may represent a new target for anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> pharmacotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the coincident regulation of energy balance and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression by a single hormone receptor system suggests that the GUCY2C axis might contribute to the established relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This confluence suggests that hormone supplementation to reconstitute GUCY2C signaling may be an elegant strategy to reverse both pathophysiologic processes </plain></SENT>
