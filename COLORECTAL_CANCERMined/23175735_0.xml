<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effectiveness of hospital-based case management (CM) in terms of patient-reported outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial allocating participants 1 : 1 to either a CM intervention or a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allocation status was evident to participants and case managers, but blinded to researchers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Patients were recruited at a Danish surgical department where the case managers were situated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who were to undergo further investigation or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria were participation in another study, poor Danish language skills or apparent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>140 participants were randomised to each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recruitment period was 11 March 2009 to 29 December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Control group patients had usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intervention group patients had usual care supplemented by hospital-based CM started at first visit to the out-patient clinic (before treatment start) and ended 4 weeks after completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CM was conducted by nurse case managers who undertook care pathway supervision, information dissemination to health professionals and outreaching patient support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-reported global quality of life measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and eight ad hoc, piloted patient evaluation items assessed at eight, 30 and 52 weeks after randomisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups were comparable as to questionnaire response rates and completed scales/items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant group differences on any of the health-related quality of life subscales at eight, 30 or 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In patient evaluations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> point estimates favoured CM at week 8 and 30; at week 52, 6 of 7 estimates favoured CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that CM influenced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients' health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients allocated to CM evaluated their care more positively than patients receiving usual care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00845247 </plain></SENT>
