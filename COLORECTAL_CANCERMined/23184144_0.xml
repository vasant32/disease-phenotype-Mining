<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two functional genetic variants (-69G&gt;A and 4150G&gt;T) in the FEN1 gene, which have been associated with DNA damage levels in coke-oven workers as well as risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0546837,C0014859" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">esophageal cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in general populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unknown how these polymorphisms and their haplotypes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the role of these polymorphisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> development using a case-control design in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of the haplotypes constructed by these two polymorphisms on <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the FEN1-69GG or 4150GG genotype were significantly associated to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk compared with the -69AA or 4150TT genotype [Odds ratios (OR) = 1.87, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.23-2.85, P = 0.003; or OR = 1.87, 95 % CI = 1.23-2.84, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associations were more pronounced among female subjects (For -69AG or GG genotype: OR = 2.35, 95 % CI = 1.22-4.52; for 4150TG or GG genotype: OR = 2.33, 95 % CI = 1.21-4.48) and patients with grade 1 or 2 disease (For -69AG or GG genotype: OR = 2.21, 95 % CI = 1.20-4.05; for 4150TG or GG genotype: OR = 2.45, 95 % CI = 1.31-4.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the G(-69)G(4150) haplotype was also significantly associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk compared with the A(-69)T(4150) haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that FEN1 polymorphisms and haplotypes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
