<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Nordic-European Initiative on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> (NordICC) is a multinational, randomized controlled trial aiming at investigating the effect of colonoscopy screening on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) incidence and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the rationale and design of the NordICC trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Men and women aged 55 to 64 years are drawn from the population registries in the participating countries and randomly assigned to either once-only colonoscopy screening with removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected lesions, or no screening (standard of care in the trial regions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals are followed for 15 years after inclusion using dedicated national registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end points of the trial are cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence during 15 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>POWER ANALYSIS: We hypothesize a 50 % <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> mortality-reducing efficacy of the colonoscopy intervention and predict 50 % compliance, yielding a 25 % mortality reduction among those invited to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For 90 % power and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, using a 2:1 randomization, 45 600 individuals will be randomized to control, and 22 800 individuals to the colonoscopy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interim analyses of the effect of colonoscopy on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence and mortality will be performed at 10-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The aim of the NordICC trial is to quantify the effectiveness of population-based colonoscopy screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This will allow development of evidence-based guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in the general population </plain></SENT>
