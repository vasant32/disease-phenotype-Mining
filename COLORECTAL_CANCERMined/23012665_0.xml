<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To ensure patient safety, rigorous quality assurance (QA) measures for colonoscopy were introduced for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Bowel Cancer</z:e> Screening Programme (BCSP) in England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of these high QA measures on patient experience and satisfaction is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the impact of this high-level QA of colonoscopy on patient satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case controlled study using a retrospective audit &amp; telephone interview patient survey was performed between 1/1/07-01/10/08 on patients that underwent colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by comparing quantitative and qualitative performance colonoscopy indicators in patients within the BCSP with those outside the programme (NON-BCSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 720 patients that had undergone day case colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Accredited BCSP centre: University Hospitals Aintree, UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Comparing patient satisfaction between BCSP to NON-BCSP populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uptake was 68% (n=488) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caecal intubation rate (CIR) was higher (99 v 91%; p=0.001), and sedation doses lower in BCSP compared to NON-BCSP (Midazolam dose Median [IQR] (1 [0, 2] v 2 [1, 3] mg; respectively p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For patient satisfaction and experience, scores were high and pain scores were low in both groups; with no statistically significant difference between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, willingness to have a repeat procedure was higher in BCSP (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whilst superior CIR with less sedation within BCSP, overall scores were similar for patient satisfaction, both in and outside the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With the higher 'willingness for repeat' within BCSP, a positive impact of higher level of QA is suggested and that good patient experience can be achieved with minimal conscious sedation in expert hands </plain></SENT>
