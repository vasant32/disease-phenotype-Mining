<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to synthesize a novel bifunctional chelating agent containing the isothiocyanate group for easy conjugation with antibodies having the characteristics of high stable chelation with therapeutic radionuclides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have synthesized the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> analogue retaining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17561,29950">L-cysteine</z:chebi> as a core ligand of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29917">thiol group</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chelating power of cysteine-based <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi>(cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) was compared with that of commercial ρ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi>-Bn-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an application, the cetuximab was radioimmunoconjugated with Lu using cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affinity was tested in a cell line overexpressing EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A therapy study was conducted in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice with subcutaneous HT-29 xenografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> presents an excellent ability to chelate as compared to the ρ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">SCN</z:chebi>-Bn-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For mean ratio chemical labeling yields of 95%, the result was 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lu-cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-cetuximab was prepared under ambient condition with a high radiolabeling yield and the radiochemical purity was sustained for at least 6days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The IC value of the Lu-labeled cetuximab was 10nM (95% confidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The stability and therapeutic efficacy of the candidate radiopharmaceutical were verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> derivative, cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, is a good bifunctional chelating agent that can be used for protein-based radiopharmaceutical using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33319">lanthanides</z:chebi> such as Lu and Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prepared Lu-cys-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>-cetuximab can be used for the diagnosis and treatment of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
