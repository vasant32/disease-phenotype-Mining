<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim is to compare 1998-2005 cancer incidence and mortality trends in Italy and the US for both sexes and for two age groups, namely 50-69 year old and 70+ year old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> incidence and mortality data came from 22 Cancer Registries (CRs) of the Italian association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries (AIRTUM), while the US incidence records were provided by 13 SEER CRs and the mortality statistics provided by the WHO Database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trends were analysed by the Joinpoint Regression Program in order to obtain Annual Percent Changes and Joinpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> incidence trends were favourable in the US for both sexes and in both age groups, whilst the rates increased in Italian elderly individuals and mortality rates fell markedly only in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, incidence and mortality decreased in men but increased in women in the two geographical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> incidence and mortality declined both in Italy and the US for younger women, but the trends were less favourable in the Italian elderly individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase of prostate incidence slowed down and mortality diminished for every age group in the US, whilst in Italy only in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, the Italian elderly experienced less favourable trends than the middle-aged patients whereas, in the US, the trends were similar for both age groups and favourable also for the elderly </plain></SENT>
