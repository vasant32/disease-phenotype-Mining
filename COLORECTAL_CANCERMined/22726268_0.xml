<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In NHS Grampian the programme was introduced in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported no difference in anatomical locations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> detected by screening programmes compared with those in unscreened populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aims to review the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> detected in an established screening programme compared with those diagnosed through symptomatic presentation within the same population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients discussed at the regional multidisciplinary meeting between June 2007 and August 2011 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collated prospectively from multidisciplinary team records while site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was documented from radiology, endoscopy, operative and pathology reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative statistics (Ï‡(2) ) were performed using spss 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1487 patients included 255 were detected via the screening programme and 1232 from symptomatic presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (splenic flexure to rectosigmoid) were detected via screening (P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of non-screened patients (n=1232), 456 (37%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were right sided (caecum to distal transverse colon), 419 (34%) were left sided and 357 (29%) were in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This compares with the screened group (n=255): right sided 74 (29%), left sided 113 (44%) and rectal 68 (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More left sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> appear to be detected in screened patients compared with symptomatic presentation, contrary to previously published work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results may be worthy of further consideration given the ongoing debate on the optimal means of screening </plain></SENT>
