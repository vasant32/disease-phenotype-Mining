<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a variety of SPS presentations, which may encompass a continuum of phenotypes modified by environmental and genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the phenotype of SPS, we recorded the histologic and molecular characteristics of multiple colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in patients with SPS recruited between 2000 and 2010 from genetics clinics in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three specialist gastrointestinal pathologists reviewed the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, which they classified into conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, with various subtypes, according to the current World Health Organization criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in BRAF and KRAS and mismatch repair protein expression were determined in a subset of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 100 patients were selected for the study, of whom 58 were female and 42 were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> count per patient ranged from 6 to 150 (median 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients (89%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334108" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">polyposis</z:e> affecting the entire large intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From this cohort, 406 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (83%) were serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>: microvesicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> (HP) (n=156), goblet cell HP (n=25), sessile serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (SSA/P) (n=110), SSA/P with cytologic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n=28), and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A further 69 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>BRAF mutation was mainly detected in SSA/P with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (95%), SSA/P (85%), microvesicular HP (76%), and traditional serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (54%), whereas KRAS mutation was present mainly in goblet cell HP (50%) and in tubulovillous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four of 6 SSA/Ps with high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> showed loss of MLH1/PMS2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was diagnosed in 39 patients who were more often found to have a conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> compared with patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with SPS referred to genetics clinics had a pancolonic disease with a high <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> burden and a high rate of BRAF mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with the presence of conventional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
