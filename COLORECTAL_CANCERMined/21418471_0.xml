<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main aims of this study were to determine LNY across multiple Australian centres and the clinico-pathologic factors that influence yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Analysis of data from prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> databases at 11 Australian centres between January 1988 and May 2008 was undertaken utilizing the linkage and analysis resources of BioGrid Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LNY depending on different clinico-pathologic patient characteristics was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 10,082 cases (54.1% men, 45.9% women) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median LNY was 12 (range 0-174) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LNY increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001) over time, from a mean of 8.5 in 1988 to 13 in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LNY also varied significantly between surgical centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Female gender, younger age, right-sided disease, higher T and N stage, specific operation types and absence of preoperative radiotherapy were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with higher LNY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While varying across centres, the median LNYs in Australia are acceptable and have improved significantly over recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple clinico-pathologic factors significantly influence the number of nodes retrieved </plain></SENT>
