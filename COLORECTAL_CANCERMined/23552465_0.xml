<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have confirmed the existence of colorectal <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> (CRCSCs) and have demonstrated that this rare cell population can be isolated by the expression of specific cell surface biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, which are crucial for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and participate in a wide variety of biological functions, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, new evidences suggest that miRNAs could contribute to preserve stemness of embryonic stem cells and could be involved in maintaining stemness of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="17437,53115">CSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have begun to outline the role of miRNAs in regulation of CRCSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This review aims to summarize the recent advancement about the roles of miRNAs in CRCSCs that may represent a step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms and the possible approaches for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
