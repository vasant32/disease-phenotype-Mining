<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the effects of Daikenchuto (DKT) (a Japanese herbal medicine) on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in patients following laparoscopic colorectal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were divided into two groups: a DKT intake group (D group, n = 15) and a control group (C group, n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The D group took 7.5 g/day of DKT from the day after surgery until the 7th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The body temperature, heart rate, WBC count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, β-D: -<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37163">glucan</z:chebi> level and Candida index were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients' mean age in the D group was significantly younger than that in the C group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>D3 lymph node dissection was performed more often in the D group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time until first flatus was significantly shorter in the D group (1.8 ± 0.5 days) than in the C group (2.7 ± 0.5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CRP level was significantly lower in the D group (4.6 ± 0.6 mg/dl) than in the C group (8.3 ± 1.1 mg/dl) on the 3rd postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative DKT administration significantly suppressed the CRP level and shortened the time until first flatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DKT administration also significantly suppressed postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
