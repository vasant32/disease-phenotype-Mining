<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> in risks was investigated using a polygenic risk modifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cumulative risks at the age of 70 years (95% confidence intervals) for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers, respectively, were estimated to be 34% (25%-50%) and 47% (36%-60%) for male carriers and 36% (25%-51%) and 37% (27%-50%) for female carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Corresponding EC risks were 18% (9.1%-34%) and 30% (18%-45%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For example, 17% of male MSH2 mutation carriers have estimated lifetime risks of 0%-10% and 18% have risks of 90%-100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, average risks are similar for the two genes but there is so much individual variation about the average that large proportions of carriers have either very low or very high lifetime <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our estimates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and EC cumulative risks for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers are the most precise currently available </plain></SENT>
