<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand a role of the colonic extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in calcium-mediated chemoprevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, we induced formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) caused by azoxymethane (AOM) injection in 'rescued' CaSR-/PTH- (C-/P-) double knockout colons compared with colons from control CaSR+/PTH+ (C+/P+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C-/P- colonic epithelia had increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling as evidenced by 3-8-fold increases in Wnt3a, CyclinD1, and MMP-7 proteins compared with C+/P+ colonic epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C-/P- colonic epithelia had reduced Wnt5a and Ror2, and a three-fold increase in TNFR1 compared with C+/P+ epithelia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The C-/P- colons and small intestine had extensive neutrophil infiltration with myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels 18-fold higher then C+/P+ small intestine and colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saline-injected C-/P- colons had the same number of ACF/cm(2) as C+/P+ colons, which were injected with AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were eight times more ACF/cm(2) in the C-/P- injected with AOM compared with C+/P+ colons, which received AOM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together our results suggest both <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and Wnt/β-catenin signaling are increased in the epithelia of 'rescued' CaSR/PTH double knockout colons, and the capacity for non-canonical Wnt signaling through Wnt5a/Ror2 engagement is reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The loss of the colonic CaSR increased the number of ACF/cm(2) in response to AOM injection, suggesting colonic CaSR may mediate the chemoprotective effect of increased dietary calcium against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> observed in humans.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 1 April 2013; doi:10.1038/labinvest.2013.51 </plain></SENT>
