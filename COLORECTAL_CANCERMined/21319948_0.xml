<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients newly treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI were identified from a large database using medical and pharmacy claims for services delivered January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> stage for a subset of patients was abstracted from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were annualized costs calculated for 4 years of observation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> as recorded by the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cost was analyzed using generalized linear modeling; mortality was modeled using Cox proportional hazards analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unadjusted annualized median and mean costs were $134,401 and $152,213, respectively, for the FOLFOX cohort (n = 41) and $103,150 and $107,994 for the FOLFIRI cohort (n = 86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred among five (12%) FOLFOX and 42 (53%) FOLFIRI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted analysis revealed no significant difference in cost between cohorts, even after adjusting for reduced irinotecan costs due to generic availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incremental costs associated with one additional life saved per year were only $1,236 higher for patients treated with FOLFOX compared with FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cox analysis revealed a significant survival advantage for FOLFOX over FOLFIRI (HR = 5.2; 95% CI: 1.7-15.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant survival benefit was seen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients receiving FOLFOX versus FOLFIRI; multivariate analysis revealed no significant cost differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the small sample size may have resulted in lack of adequate power to detect a difference between cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There may be factors influencing mortality that were not included in the multivariate modeling </plain></SENT>
