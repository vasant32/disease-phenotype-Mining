<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody developed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The parameters of RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e>) are not adequate to detect important treatment effects and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to evaluate the possibility of using sTRAIL (serum-soluble TNF-related <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-inducing ligand) and VEGF as markers of treatment efficacy and prognosis in patients with metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: sTRAIL and VEGF levels were measured by ELISA in the sera of 16 bevacizumab-treated metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients and 10 presumably healthy age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurements were taken before and after treatment for comparison purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of sTRAIL were found in seven out of 16 patients after bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these patients had a median survival time of 20.6 months, the remaining bevacizumab-treated patients who did not show an increase in sTRAIL had a median survival time of 9.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As expected, serum VEGF levels were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received bevacizumab therapy and showed no correlation between serum VEGF levels and patient survival (data not shown) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum sTRAIL levels might be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, in the early evaluation stages following bevacizumab treatment </plain></SENT>
