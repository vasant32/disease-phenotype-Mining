<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined changes in general medical care among elderly patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), from before diagnosis through long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: this longitudinal cohort study used 1993 to 1999 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and 1991 to 2001 Medicare claims data for 22,161 patients with stage 0 to 3 CRC and 81,669 controls aged 67 to 89 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were preventive services (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination, mammography) and, among diabetics, HgbA1c and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> testing in the phase before diagnosis, the phase after initial treatment, the surveillance phase, and the survival care phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression provided adjusted relative risks of care receipt for patients with stage 0 to 1 cancer, stage 2 to 3 cancer, and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: in the phase before diagnosis through the surveillance phase, patients with stage 0 to 1 CRC had the highest annual preventive service rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with stage 2 to 3 CRC made substantial gains in preventive service use, especially mammography, after diagnosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> vaccination, 46.4% before diagnosis to 50.2% after initial treatment; mammography, 31.4% before diagnosis to 40.2% after initial treatment) but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care (eg, HgbA1c, 53.4% before diagnosis to 54.9% after initial treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis seems to facilitate receipt of preventive services but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care for elderly, later-stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional strategies such as strengthening partnerships between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, primary care physicians, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care physicians are needed to improve care for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
