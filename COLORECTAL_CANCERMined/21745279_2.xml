<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> has tripled over the last 30 years in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we lack adequate, contemporary, population-based estimates of the excess mortality patients who are at risk compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the overall survival in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> compared with the general population taking into account the effects of severity and aetiology of disease and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a cohort study, we identified 4537 people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and a control cohort of 44 403 patients, matched by age, sex and general practice from the UK General Practice Research Database between June 1987 and April 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with compensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> had a nearly five-fold [hazard ratio (HR) 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4-5.0] increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, while those with decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> had a near 10-fold (HR 9.7, 95% CI 8.9-10.6) increased risk compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> conferred a worse prognosis than non-alcohol-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> both in the first year following diagnosis and subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Having a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> confers a substantial increased mortality risk compared with the general population, even for those with compensated disease, with 5-year survival between that seen for breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
