<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and their FDRs were recruited through the population-based Victorian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry, Victoria, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven hundred and seven FDRs completed telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 405 FDRs were deemed asymptomatic and eligible for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of FDRs had ever received any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First-degree relatives of older age, those with private health insurance, siblings and FDRs who had ever been asked about family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by a doctor were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have ever received <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five percent of FDRs "at or slightly above average risk" were adherent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For this group, adherence to guideline-recommended screening was significantly more likely to occur for male FDRs and those with a higher level of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For persons at "moderately increased risk" and "potentially high risk", 47% and 49% respectively adhered to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For this group, guideline-recommended screening was significantly more likely to occur for FDRs who were living in metropolitan areas, siblings, those married or partnered and those ever asked about family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant level of non-compliance with screening guidelines was evident among FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in accordance with guidelines and effective systematic interventions to increase screening rates among population groups experiencing inequality are needed </plain></SENT>
