<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its use is often avoided due to patient condition or disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 228 consecutive patients receiving first-line FOLFOX-based regimens from June 2007 to June 2009, 96 patients (42 %) received FOLFOX alone without bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively examined the reasons why bevacizumab was not combined with FOLFOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 96 patients for whom the addition of bevacizumab was avoided, 73 patients (76 %) had bevacizumab-related contraindications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, wound-healing complications and gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other avoidance reasons were conditions precluding the use of bevacizumab in 15 patients (16 %), economic problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> about adverse events in 8 patients (8 %), and unknown reasons in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab-related contraindications were the main reason for drug avoidance, though economic problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> about rare but serious adverse events were also factors for avoidance of bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
