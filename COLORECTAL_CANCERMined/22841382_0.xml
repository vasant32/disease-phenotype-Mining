<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lack of tactile feedback, though, has led to lengthy operations and high conversion rates with attendant adverse effects on patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL), in contrast, provides tactile feedback while still being minimally invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that HAL compared with LA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections will be associated with lower conversion rates and decreased operative times, without compromising the advantages of laparoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-matched study of patients undergoing LA or HAL <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections from 2002 to 2010, using a prospectively maintained <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> database at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Short-term outcomes analyzed (using the Wilcoxon signed rank and McNemar's tests) included operative and perioperative variables and surrogate markers of adequacy of oncologic care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-seven LA patients were matched 1:1 by age and resection with 47 HAL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in the HAL group had significantly lower blood loss (100 versus 150 cc, P = 0.04), operative times (206 versus 252 min, P = 0.002), and conversion rates (6% versus 38%, P &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They also spent fewer days in the intensive care unit (0 versus 1, P = 0.004) and had quicker return of flatus (3 versus 4 d, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HAL resulted in more lymph nodes resected (21 versus 15, P = 0.03) and a more adequate lymph node harvest (98% versus 77%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HAL is associated with improved operative efficiency, conversion rates, and lymphadenectomy as compared with LA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HAL should be considered in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
