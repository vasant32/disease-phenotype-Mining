<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing analysis were employed to assess the polymorphism of DNMT3B gene promoter-149C→T and-579G→T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For DNMT3B-149C��T, no significant deviation was observed in the genotype distributions of polymorphisms between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cases (TT: 98.90% (538/544); CT: 1.10% (6/544)) and controls (TT: 97.75% (521/533); CT: 2.25% (12/533)) (χ(2) = 2.07, P = 0.15) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the-579 G allele could significantly decrease the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (adjusted OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.35 - 0.72) in comparison with the -579 TT genotype </plain></SENT>
