<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> is caused by germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 mismatch-repair genes and leads to a high risk of colorectal and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that constitutional 3' end deletions of EPCAM can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> through epigenetic silencing of MSH2 in EPCAM-expressing tissues, resulting in tissue-specific MSH2 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to establish the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> associated with such EPCAM deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained clinical data for 194 carriers of a 3' end EPCAM deletion from 41 families known to us at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands and compared <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk with data from a previously described cohort of 473 carriers from 91 families with mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or a combined EPCAM-MSH2 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 93 of the 194 EPCAM deletion carriers were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; three of the 92 women with EPCAM deletions were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carriers of an EPCAM deletion had a 75% (95% CI 65-85) cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> before the age of 70 years (mean age at diagnosis 43 years [SD 12]), which did not differ significantly from that of carriers of combined EPCAM-MSH2 deletion (69% [95% CI 47-91], p=0·8609) or mutations in MSH2 (77% [64-90], p=0·5892) or MLH1 (79% [68-90], p=0·5492), but was higher than noted for carriers of MSH6 mutation (50% [38-62], p&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, women with EPCAM deletions had a 12% [0-27] cumulative risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e>, which was lower than was that noted for carriers of a combined EPCAM-MSH2 deletion (55% [20-90], p&lt;0·0001) or of a mutation in MSH2 (51% [33-69], p=0·0006) or MSH6 (34% [20-48], p=0·0309), but did not differ significantly from that noted for MLH1 (33% [15-51], p=0·1193) mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This risk seems to be restricted to deletions that extend close to the MSH2 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 194 carriers of an EPCAM deletion, three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0541912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">duodenal cancer</z:e> and four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: EPCAM deletion carriers have a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; only those with deletions extending close to the MSH2 promoter have an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the effect of mosaic MSH2 deficiency, leading to variable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risks, and could form the basis of an optimised protocol for the recognition and targeted prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in EPCAM deletion carriers </plain></SENT>
