<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) improves outcomes and reduces its incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, population-based screening in Malaysia continues to be a challenge, in view of cost and limited availability of colonoscopic skills and facilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional qualitative faecal occult blood tests help to prioritize those who require earlier colonoscopies, but cannot distinguish between benign and malignant causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, quantitative immunochemical faecal occult blood tests (qFOBT) have demonstrated some discriminatory ability in distinguishing benign and malignant causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aim to assess feasibility of qFOBT as a tool for stratification of colonoscopic priority in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A health awareness exhibition was held in a major shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur on 6 and 7 Feb 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> asymptomatic individuals&gt; 40 years, and those &lt; 40 with family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, were invited to participate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eligible participants were given a questionnaire and screened using a qFOBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A faecal <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 100 - 199 ng/mL was considered moderately positive, while a level of 200 ng/mL or more was strongly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants with a strongly positive qFOBT result were scheduled for a colonoscopy within the month, while those who were moderately positive were scheduled within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 125 (82%) participants returned the qFOBT kit, of which 70 (56%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median age was 54 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Majority of the participants were Chinese (60%), followed by Malay (25%), Indian (12%) and others (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Twelve (10%) participants were tested positive and were advised to undergo colonoscopy but 9 (75%) declined colonoscopy and further investigations citing lack of time as the reason </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Of the 3 participants (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the moderately positive group) who underwent colonoscopy, 2 had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic findings revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019112" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemorrhoids</z:e> in one participant and two participants had histologically proven benign sigmoid <z:mp ids='MP_0003269'>colonic polyps</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of qFOBT as a tool to screen and prioritize asymptomatic patients for early colonoscopy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening is logistically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, in order for it to be effective, measures to improve compliance to colonoscopy need to be taken </plain></SENT>
