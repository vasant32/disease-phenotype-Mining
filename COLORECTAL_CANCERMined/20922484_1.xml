<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experts estimate that about 85% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> begin as precancerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, early detection and treatment of which can significantly reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is imperative to develop population-wide intervention strategies for early detection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Development of such strategies requires precise values of population-specific rates of incidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> and its progression to cancerous stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There has been a considerable amount of research in recent years on developing screening based <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> intervention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these are not supported by population-specific mathematical estimates of progression rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paper addresses this need by developing a probability model that estimates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> progression rates considering race and family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>; note that, it is ethically infeasible to obtain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> progression rates through clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We use the estimated rates to simulate the progression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> in the population of the State of Indiana, and also the population of a clinical trial conducted in the State of Minnesota, which was obtained from literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from the simulations are used to validate the probability model </plain></SENT>
