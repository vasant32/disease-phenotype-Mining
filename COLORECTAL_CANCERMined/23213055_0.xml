<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Controversy exists about CYP2D6 genotype and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A matched case-control study was conducted using the Austrian Breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> Study Group Trial 8 (ABCSG8) that randomized postmenopausal women with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor (ER)-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> for 5 years (arm A) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> for 2 years followed by anastrozole for 3 years (arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases had disease recurrence, contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, second non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each case, controls were identified from the same treatment arm of similar age, surgery/radiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-node-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (TNM) stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was conducted for alleles associated with no (PM; *3, *4, *6), reduced (IM; *10, and *41), and extensive (EM: absence of these alleles) CYP2D6 metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The common CYP2D6*4 allele was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In arm A during the first 5 years of therapy, women with two poor alleles [PM/PM: OR, 2.45; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-5.73, P = 0.04] and women with one poor allele (PM/IM or PM/EM: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.95-2.93; P = 0.07) had a higher likelihood of an event than women with two extensive alleles (EM/EM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In years 3 to 5 when patients remained on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> (arm A) or switched to anastrozole (arm B), PM/PM tended toward a higher likelihood of a disease event relative to EM/EM (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.86-6.66; P = 0.09) among women on arm A but not among women on arm B (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.03-2.30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In ABCSG8, the negative effects of reduced CYP2D6 metabolism were observed only during the period of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> administration and not after switching to anastrozole </plain></SENT>
