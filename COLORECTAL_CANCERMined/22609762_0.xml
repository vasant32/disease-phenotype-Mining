<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency may contribute to DNA hypomethylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, findings on the association between total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> concentration and global DNA methylation have been inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study determined global, LINE-1, and Alu DNA methylation in blood and colon of healthy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and their relationship to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa from 112 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients and 114 healthy people were analyzed for global DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> species distribution using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat element methylation was determined using end-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colorectal mucosa had lower global and repeat element DNA methylation compared with peripheral blood (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex and smoking history, global but not repeat element methylation was marginally higher in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients compared with healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colorectal mucosa from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subjects had lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20612">5-methyltetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> and formyltetrahydrofolate levels than blood from the same individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels should not be used as a surrogate for the levels in colorectal mucosa because there are marked differences in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> species distribution between the two tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, repeat element methylation is not a good surrogate measure of global DNA methylation in both blood and colonic mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that mucosal global DNA methylation or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> distribution was related to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> per se, suggesting that if abnormalities exist, they are confined to individual cells rather than the entire colon </plain></SENT>
