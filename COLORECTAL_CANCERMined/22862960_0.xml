<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify individual, provider and psychosocial factors associated with (i) ever seeking medical advice and (ii) seeking early medical advice for primary symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1592 persons aged 56-88 years randomly selected from the Hunter Community Study (HCS) were sent a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Males and those who had received screening advice from a doctor were at significantly higher odds of ever seeking medical advice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persons who had private health coverage, consulted a doctor because the 'symptom was serious', or who did not wait to consult a doctor for another reason were at significantly higher odds of seeking early medical advice (&lt; 2 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For change in bowel habit, persons with lower income, within the healthy weight range, or who had discussed their family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> irrespective of whether informed of 'increased risk' were at significantly higher odds of ever seeking medical advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Persons frequenting their GP less often and seeing their doctor because the symptom persisted were at significantly higher odds of seeking early medical advice (&lt; 2 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The seriousness of symptoms, importance of early detection, and prompt consultation must be articulated in health messages to at-risk persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study identified modifiable factors, both individual and provider-related to consultation behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effective health promotion efforts must heed these factors and target sub-groups less likely to seek early medical advice </plain></SENT>
