<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A prospective cross-sectional study was designed to test if total levels of TIMP-1 in saliva and plasma correlated with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in a population with symptoms consistent with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stimulated whole saliva and blood samples were collected from 161 individuals referred to colonoscopy with symptoms associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the examination, as well as previous and/or current other diseases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a blinded study, the authors used an in-house TIMP-1 ELISA previously validated for use in saliva and plasma to determine total levels of TIMP-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six of the patients (35%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma TIMP-1 levels were significantly elevated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients compared with patients with other, non-malignant diseases and individuals without disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in saliva TIMP-1 levels between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, no correlation was found between levels of TIMP-1 in plasma and saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Total levels of TIMP-1 in saliva do not reflect the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and TIMP-1 saliva measurements thus cannot substitute plasma TIMP-1 measurements in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
