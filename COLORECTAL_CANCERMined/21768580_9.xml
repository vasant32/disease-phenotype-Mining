<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies to identify the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, with attention to sex, age at screening, and differential effects for probands and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Markov model that incorporated risk for colorectal, endometrial, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TIME HORIZON: Lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Strategies based on clinical criteria, prediction algorithms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> testing, or up-front germline mutation testing, followed by tailored screening and risk-reducing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The benefit of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strategies accrued primarily to relatives with a mutation associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, particularly women, whose life expectancy could increase by approximately 4 years with hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy and adherence to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At current rates of germline testing, screening, and prophylactic surgery, the strategies reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by 7% to 42% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from endometrial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> by 1% to 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-testing strategies, immunohistochemistry followed by BRAF mutation testing was preferred, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,200 per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The number of relatives tested per proband was a critical determinant of both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with testing of 3 to 4 relatives required for most strategies to meet a threshold of $50,000 per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry followed by BRAF mutation testing was preferred in 59% of iterations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a threshold of $100,000 per life-year gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> with immunohistochemistry followed by BRAF mutation testing only up to age 70 years cost $44,000 per incremental life-year gained compared with screening only up to age 60 years, and screening without an upper age limit cost $88,700 per incremental life-year gained compared with screening only up to age 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, uncertain family pedigrees, and genetic variants of unknown significance were not considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> testing to identify families with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> could yield substantial benefits at acceptable costs, particularly for women with a mutation associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> who begin regular screening and have risk-reducing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The cost-effectiveness of such testing depends on the participation rate among relatives at risk for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
