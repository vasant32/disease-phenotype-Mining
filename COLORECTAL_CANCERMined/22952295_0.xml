<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has changed dramatically with the implementation of, for example, screening, endoscopy and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is therefore of interest to monitor the long-term trends in population 'cure' in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed 33 885 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cases diagnosed between 1975 and 2000 in Osaka </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied the multivariable mixture cure model to estimate cure fraction and median survival time (MST) for 'uncured' patients, by sex, age, stage, period at diagnosis and subsite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, the cure fraction increased by about 25%, while MST for the uncured was prolonged from 8 to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cure fraction was 5% higher in men than in women, while MST was similar in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cure fraction also increased for localized and regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>, the cure fraction increased by about 25-30%, but remained lower than for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From the late 1970s, the cure fraction for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> increased dramatically due to better management of detection and care for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This improvement was obtained at the cost of shorter MST for uncured patients </plain></SENT>
