<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The UGT1A1 gene encodes for an enzyme that metabolizes irinotecan, and its genetic variants were shown to be associated with increased drug toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the UGT1A1*28 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 329 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients from the Israeli population-based Molecular Epidemiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e> study who were treated with a chemotherapy regimen that included irinotecan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> or disease recurrence were followed up for a median period of 2 years after occurrence of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study end points were appearance of grade 3-4 hematological and gastroenterological toxicity, hospitalization due to toxic events (mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>), length of hospitalization, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UGT1A1*28 was genotyped from peripheral blood DNA by fragment analysis and reported as number of TATA sequence repeats in the promoter of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 7/7 variant of UGT1A1*28 was detected in 11.9% of the 329 participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was significantly higher in 7/7 carriers compared with 6/7 and 6/6 carriers (48.0%,10.2%, and 7.7% respectively; P &lt; .001), as was the risk of toxicity-related hospitalization (45.8%, 25.3%, and 14.4% respectively; P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 2 months of treatment start (12.8%, 5.2%, and 2.9%, respectively) and median overall survival (1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 years, respectively; P = .01) were significantly worse in the 7/7 carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The age/stage-adjusted hazard ratio for patients with the 7/7 genotype compared with 6/6 was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype is strongly associated with severe hematological toxicity and higher hospitalization rate and predicts lower survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in users of irinotecan </plain></SENT>
