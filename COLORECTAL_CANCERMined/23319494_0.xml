<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The active form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), is mostly known for its importance in the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, next to its classical effects on bone, kidney and intestine, 1,25(OH)2D3 also exerts <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects on various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of 1,25(OH)2D3 itself as treatment against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> is hampered by its calcemic side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 1,25(OH)2D3-derived analogs were developed that are characterized by lower calcemic side effects and stronger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review mainly focuses on the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in breast, prostate and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and the underlying signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs inhibit proliferation, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, migration/invasion and induce differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in malignant cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis and Wnt/b-catenin signaling are also influenced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Human studies indicate an inverse association between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17933">25(OH)D3</z:chebi> values and the incidence of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the literature, it appears that the epidemiological link between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is the strongest for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, however more intervention studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials are needed to unravel the beneficial dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs to induce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
