<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, quality of life (QOL) of the participants should not be affected by the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of the study was to isolate the influence of colonoscopy, by investigation QOL before and after the procedure in a cohort of consecutive patients with different indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a prospective, longitudinal study, designed to compare the potential influence of colonoscopy on QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy for various reasons and indications, we filled a QOL short form-36 and a short feedback questionnaire before, immediately after, and a month after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also measured the quality of the endoscopy, the outcome in patients, and acceptability among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant change before and immediately after colonoscopy in any of the short form-36 parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physical functioning, role limitation physical, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitation mental, and mental health had very similar scores before and 2-3 h after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease in the physical functioning a month after the procedure (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The same was found for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients, but not for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy did not affect QOL in the short or the long duration after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such, colonoscopy may be suitable as a part of screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe that QOL estimation should be an integral part of assessment of a screening program </plain></SENT>
