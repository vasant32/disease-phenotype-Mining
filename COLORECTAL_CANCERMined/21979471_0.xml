<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the accuracy of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland scoring system in predicting the 30-day mortality after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Hong Kong elderly (aged 80 years or more) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early mortality outcome audit in a historical cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Chinese patients (aged 80 years or more) who underwent elective or emergency surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in the Department of Surgery between January 2005 and December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to estimate the predictive ability of the score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 180 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were included in this review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day and hospital mortality rates were 29/180 (16%) and 31/180 (17%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland score was significantly higher among patients who died within 30 days (4.2 vs 3.1, P=0.0001), and was the only independent predictor for 30-day mortality by logistic regression (P=0.009; odds ratio=2.555; 95% confidence interval, 1.277-4.932) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mean score of this study population was 3.22 (median, 3.10), giving a predicted 30-day mortality rate of 16.0 to 17.4%, which corresponded with an observed 30-day mortality of 16.1% encountered in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The score had a significantly larger area under the curve for the 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio=0.811; 95% confidence interval, 0.722-0.849) as compared to the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (0.664; 0.589-0.735) [P=0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland scoring system can accurately predict the 30-day mortality rate of elderly Hong Kong Chinese patients (aged 80 years or more) operated on for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
