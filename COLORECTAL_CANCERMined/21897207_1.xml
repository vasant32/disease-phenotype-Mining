<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Quantitative fecal immunochemical test (QTFIT) has the advantage of being able to describe test characteristics on a scaled rather than binary system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to decide the optimal cut-off points of QTFIT and to make a multivariate prediction model for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in asymptomatic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1085 consecutive asymptomatic individuals who completed both full colonoscopy and QTFIT at a general health checkup clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyps</z:mpath> (AP) were defined as APs of at least 1 cm in diameter; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with villous component or high-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>; and significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (SN) including both advanced AP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ideal cut-off value of QTFIT was chosen based on a value that maximized the sum of both sensitivity and specificity, and clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For AP, 25 ng/ml was chosen as the optimal cut-off value and provided a sensitivity of 31% [95% confidence interval (CI): 27-36] and specificity of 79% (95% CI: 76-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For SN, the ideal QTFIT cut-off value was 25 ng/ml, providing a sensitivity of 51% (95% CI: 39-62) and specificity of 77% (95% CI: 74-80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the optimal cut-off point was 50 ng/ml, offering a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 41-93) and specificity of 86% (95% CI: 85-86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multivariate prediction model was represented by nomogram and was validated by bootstrap method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of QTFIT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is promising, although its sensitivity for AP and SN is unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BMI, in addition to age and sex improves the accuracy of SN screening by QTFIT </plain></SENT>
