<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Accumulated data seem to support the concept that proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) should be considered as different disease entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a particular aspect of this assumption by examining variation of stage and grade distribution according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site in a Greek patients' group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 200 cases having had undergone surgery for primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were compared to 143 distal lesions regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage (TNM I-IV) and grade of differentiation (well, moderate and poor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade distribution by site was also examined within each particular stage and within additional stage categories (I-II, III-IV, I-III, II-IV, II-III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an almost significant trend of distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> for earlier stage (I) presentation (p=0.055), whereas proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were more frequently diagnosed with stages II-III (p=0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poorly differentiated lesions displayed a strong predilection for proximal site (p=0.002), while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with moderate differentiation were preferentially found distally (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such segmental differences in grade distribution were also ascertained within most particular stages and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> additional stage subsets (especially the last three) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both the proximal and the poorly differentiated lesions showed a parallel decrease in their incidence during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The consistently recorded worse histological pattern of proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> implies a different biological behavior of these lesions possibly due to distinct tumorigenic pathways involved in their development, whereas their tendency for late stage presentation demands further investigation before considered supportive to this concept </plain></SENT>
