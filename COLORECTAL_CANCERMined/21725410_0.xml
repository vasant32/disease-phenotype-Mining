<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we explored Chinese immigrants' attitudes and perceptions towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A grounded theory methodology was used explore the determinants of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In depth one-on-one interviews were conducted and subsequently analysed to develop an appreciation of the perspectives on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening among Chinese people living in New Zealand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings indicated a high degree of perceived acceptability for the concept of a national <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chinese participants valued health care and preventive health measures were highly prioritised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> suffered from the 'poor cousin' syndrome whereby other more highly publicised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, such <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e>, were perceived to be more relevant and serious, thus marginalising the perceived priority of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, participants paid close attention to their bodies' balance and were proactive in seeking medical advice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient practitioner interaction was also found to be influential in the patient's decision to seek screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that the introduction of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programme in New Zealand would benefit from close attention to cultural determinants of screening uptake to provide an equitable service and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chinese patients who are eligible for participating in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening would benefit from access to appropriately detailed and culturally relevant information on the risks, benefit and procedures associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
