<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyze the prognostic value of tissue expression of intraepithelial CD3 (CD3I) both overall and in the early tumoral stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We revised 251 patients with resected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and favorable clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD3I expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was used to analyze the variables independently associated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We analyzed CD3I(+) expression in relation to survival and tumoral progression, both overall and in patients with pTNM(I-II) stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic accuracy of CD3I expression were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 25.9% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were CD3I(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 74 months, CD3I(+) expression showed a favorable prognostic value for survival in the multivariate analysis (p=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival curves and absence of tumoral progression were more favorable in CD3I(+) cases, both overall (p=0.009 and p=0.004, respectively), and in stages I-II (p=0.029 and p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The specificity and positive predictive value of CD3I(+) were as follows: Survival: overall: specificity =0.89; positive predictive value =0.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stage (I-II): specificity =0.94; positive predictive value =0.98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Absence of tumoral progression: overall: specificity=0.89; positive predictive value =0.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stage (I-II): specificity =0.92; positive predictive value =0.96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CD3I expression has an favorable independent prognostic value, with statistically significantly higher percentages of survival and absence of tumoral progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This more favorable outcome is maintained in the less advanced stages (I-II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CD3I expression shows high specificity and positive predictive value </plain></SENT>
