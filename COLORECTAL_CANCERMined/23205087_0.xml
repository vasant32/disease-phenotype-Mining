<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> (KRAS) mutations represent an early event in the development and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that KRAS mutations serve as a predictor of response to EGFR-targeted therapies for patients with metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the portion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> KRAS status and molecular subtypes of KRAS mutations in Jordan as compared with other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was isolated from 100 consecutive colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> specimens from patients who underwent surgical resection or colonoscopic biopsies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> and had developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were detected by hybridization-based strip assay as well as RT-PCR-based assay and confirmed by standard Sanger sequencing of codon 12 and 13 of exon 1 of the KRAS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 100 tested patients, 56% had a wt-KRAS genotype and 44% had a mutated KRAS genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pGly12Asp was the most commonly detected mutation (54.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were independently associated with patient age, gender and tumoral variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of mutated versus wt-KRAS patients in this study is similar to those reported in Western countries but contrasts to neighboring Middle Eastern countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cases from Jordan had higher KRAS mutation frequencies compared with other Middle Eastern countries which is likely to reflect different molecular pathogenesis and environmental exposures </plain></SENT>
