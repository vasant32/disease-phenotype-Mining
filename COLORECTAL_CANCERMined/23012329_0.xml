<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to examine ethnic variation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and lung, colorectal, breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, POPULATION, MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: This retrospective cohort study of 4.65 million people linked the 2001 Scottish Census (providing ethnic group) to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the White Scottish population as reference (value 100), directly age standardised rates and ratios (DASR and DASRR), and risk ratios, by sex and ethnic group with 95% CI were calculated for first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the results below, 95% CI around the DASRR excludes 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight indicators of socio-economic position were assessed as potential confounders across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> the White Scottish population (100) had the highest DASRRs, Indians the lowest (men 45.9 and women 41.2) and White British (men 87.6 and women 87.3) and other groups were intermediate (eg, Chinese men 57.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> the DASRRs for Pakistani men (45.0), and women (53.5), were low and for any mixed background men high (174.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> the DASRRs were lowest in Pakistanis (men 32.9 and women 68.9), White British (men 82.4 and women 83.7), other White (men 77.2 and women 74.9) and Chinese men (42.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> in women was low in Pakistanis (62.2), Chinese (63.0) and White Irish (84.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>Prostate cancer</z:hpo> was lowest in Pakistanis (38.7), Indian (62.6) and White Irish (85.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No socio-economic indicator was a valid confounding variable across ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 'Scottish effect' does not apply across ethnic groups for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The findings have implications for clinical care, prevention and screening, for example, responding appropriately to the known low uptake among South Asian populations of bowel screening might benefit from modelling of cost-effectiveness of screening, given comparatively low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
