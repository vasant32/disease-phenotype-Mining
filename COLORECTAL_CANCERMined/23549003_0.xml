<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection remains the mainstay for the treatment of colorectal lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, but a group of patients who are medically inoperable or unsuitable for surgery are treated with radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this multi-institutional study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and investigate the prognostic factors affecting local control and survival in this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with 43 lesions who underwent curative radiotherapy for isolated lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> at nine institutions from 2003 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total dose of 42-75 Gy at the peripheral planning target volume was administered in 3-35 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median biologically equivalent dose was 84 Gy (range, 58.5-180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment response was complete in 10 (33.3%), partial in 13 (43.3%), stable in six (20.0%), and progressive in one patient (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 29.0 months (range, 5.0-93.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier local control at 5 years was 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 46.2 months, and the 5-year overall survival was 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients (77%) experienced treatment failure, most of which were intrapulmonary failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The intrapulmonary relapse-free survival and overall relapse-free survival at 5 years were 22% and 19%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment response and preradiotherapy carcinoembryonic antigen level were significant prognostic factors for local control and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-5 toxicity occurred in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three patients had grade 5 toxicity, including radiation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002575'>tracheoesophageal fistula</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002105'>hemoptysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Curative radiotherapy for isolated lung <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in patients who are medially inoperable or unsuitable for surgery results in long-term survival, comparable to surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Curative radiotherapy could be an effective and noninvasive alternative if dose-limiting toxicity is carefully considered, particularly in patients with bilateral or central lesions </plain></SENT>
