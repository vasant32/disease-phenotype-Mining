<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The utility of CEA and CA19-9 as colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) markers is limited and development of additional reliable markers is under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that galectin-1 is overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If such a protein leaks into the peripheral circulation, it might constitute a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we test the hypothesis that the levels of circulating galectins could reflect the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and/or its progression state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We constructed sandwich ELISAs for galectin-1/-2/-3/-4/-7 and determined their plasma concentrations in 105 CRC patients and 100 healthy volunteers (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Matched pair samples of 56 patients pre- and post-surgery were also subjected to ELISA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating levels of galectin-1/-3/-4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were significantly higher compared to those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Galectin-1 and galectin-4 levels significantly decreased after surgery (P&lt;0.01), and the level of galectin-4 in most patients fell below the cut-off value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of circulating galectin-4 significantly increased as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage progressed (P&lt;0.001), whereas those for galectin-1 were relatively high from an early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined use of galectin-4 with CEA and/or CA19-9 markedly increased the proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who were positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (from 33.3 to 59.0% for CEA and from 17.1 to 51.4% for CA19-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data show that galectin-4 may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker for use in patient follow-up, while galectin-1 could be used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In particular, galectin-4 can be useful as a complementary marker when combined with CEA/CA19-9 to improve <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> follow-up </plain></SENT>
