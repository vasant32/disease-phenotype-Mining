<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aiming to find new diagnostic proteins, we applied the proteomic DIGE technology to analyze changes in the secretome before/after differentiation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> Caco-2 cell line, an accepted in vitro model to study colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the secretomes from undifferentiated (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-like) and differentiated cells (resembling healthy enterocytes) were compared, we found 96 spots differentially expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After MS/MS analysis, 22 spots corresponding to 15 different proteins were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis demonstrated these 22 spots could serve as a discriminatory panel between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-like and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the identified proteins, the translationally-controlled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> protein (TCTP), the transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFÎ²Ip), and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028064" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Niemann-Pick disease</z:e> type C2 protein (NPC2) are interesting candidates for future studies focused on their utility as serum biomarkers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
