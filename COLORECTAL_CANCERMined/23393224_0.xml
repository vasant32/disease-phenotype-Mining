<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 50 sample set including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and healthy control sera was used to identify the serum proteins involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> using serum proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alpha-2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1, zinc-binding (AZGP1), pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) were selected as good candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two independent cohorts of 868 individuals were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of selected proteins in serum from cohort 1 (n = 534) was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> sera of this cohort (n = 405) were assigned to training and test sets, which were used to identify and verify the prognostic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prognostic values of identified proteins were further validated in cohort 2 (n = 334) using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the elevated AZGP1 and decreased PEDF and PRDX2 expressions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> serum and tissues were correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the training set, higher AZGP1 and lower PEDF levels in sera were significantly associated with a poorer overall survival (OS), higher AZGP1 was also associated with a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association was verified in the testing set and further validated in patients in cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with lower PEDF or PRDX2 levels in their <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues had a significantly poorer DFS or OS than patients with high levels of these proteins in cohort 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the prognostic performance of serum AZGP1 and PEDF was independent of other clinicopathological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose that they may serve as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
