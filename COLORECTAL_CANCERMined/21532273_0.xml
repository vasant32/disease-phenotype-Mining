<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported previously that spline interpolation is effective as a pretreatment before analyzing clinical data by time series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, further improvement is required to understand the detailed tendency of clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the tendency of interpolated hematological data was investigated in the period between the most tolerated dose (MTD) and low-dose chemotherapy (LDC) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were received both MTD and LDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematological data, white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), were interpolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of interpolation was verified using leave-one-out cross-validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference, Δ(i), was calculated from interpolated data and exhibited as a function of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predictions of RBC and MCV were accurate with high correlation coefficients, although the interpolation of WBC data was inaccurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A marked difference was observed in the trend of Δ(i) between LDC and MTD periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SD-RBC showed significant differences between LDC and MTD periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SD-MCV average in the LDC period was larger than in the MTD period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SD-MCV showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An attractor plot of Δ(i) in RBC clarified the tendency of the interpolated RBC data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a possibility that Δ(i) of RBC and/or SD-RBC may contribute to monitoring adverse reactions and decision of medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is also useful to check on attractor plot of Δ(i) in RBC together with SD-RBC in order to find out untoward reactions and decision of medication </plain></SENT>
