<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of radiotherapy, including whole brain radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and prognostic factors in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data of 78 patients who received multidisciplinary treatment from 1996 to 2007 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>), and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six potential prognostic factors were evaluated: age, gender, number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e>, extracerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> diagnosis to radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> for the entire cohort were 8 and 6 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection-incorporating treatment resulted in significant improvement in OS (P = .036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, OS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> were significantly correlated with lack of extracerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (P = .024 and P = .041, respectively), lower number of lesions (P &lt; .001 and P = .007, respectively) and interval from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis (P &lt; .001 and .005, respectively) whereas RPA class I-II demonstrated significance only for OS (P = .045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SRS-incorporating therapy revealed a 1-year LC probability of 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that surgery can prolong survival in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SRS-incorporating treatment provides excellent LC rates and should be considered for patients with 1-3 lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The strong association between survival and the prognostic factors identified in this study highlights a patient subset that may potentially benefit from new, more aggressive therapies </plain></SENT>
