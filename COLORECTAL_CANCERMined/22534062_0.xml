<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hundreds even thousands of cells can be levitated in suspension and generate 2D or 3D aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the aggregation rate and the 2D or 3D configurations of the resultant aggregates are very difficult to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work reports on a novel way of generating and controlling particle and cell aggregates using pulsed ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique specifically explores (in addition to the ultrasound wave, frequency and amplitude) the time of ultrasound application, i.e. the number of pulses as well as the pulse repetition frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that with pulsed ultrasound, particles and/or cells levitate in suspension, as with continuous ultrasound, and the aggregation rate can be modified in a controlled manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By carefully tuning the number of pulses and the repetition frequency, the 3-D and 2-D configurations of the aggregates can be selectively generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, pulsed ultrasound limits transducer heating, thus allowing for higher acoustic energies than those currently employed with continuous ultrasound </plain></SENT>
