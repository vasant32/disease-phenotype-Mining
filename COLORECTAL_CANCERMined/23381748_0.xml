<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with curative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the postoperative results of laparoscopic and laparotomic colorectal resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of a series of 189 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The descriptive variables were age and gender, and for outcome were type of resection, number of lymph nodes resected, free margins, the need for colostomy, complications, operative time and hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed using the chi-square, Student t and Mann-Whitney test, with significance level &lt;0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 189 operated patients, 110 met the inclusion criteria, 75 (68.2%) operated by open surgery and 35 (31.8%) by laparoscopic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sigmoid colon was the most common site presented by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and rectosigmoidectomy was performed more by open colorectal resection (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conversion rate was 7.9% (3/38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients were operated by open surgery in 81.5% of time less than 180 minutes (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both pathways, the average number of removed lymph nodes was greater than 12, but laparotomy enabled, more frequently, the resection of 12 or more nodes (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had surgical margins involved, but laparotomy allowed a greater number of patients with a margin greater than 5 cm from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased number of patients treated by open surgery were hospitalized for more than seven days (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences regarding the need for ostomies, complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic approach was as safe and effective as laparotomy in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and was associated with increased operative time, shorter hospital stay and less morbidity </plain></SENT>
