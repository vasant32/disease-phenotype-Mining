<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is, at present, no immunohistochemical marker that can discriminate between lymph node-negative and or lymph node-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: The expression of endoglin was quantified by immunohistochemistry and assessment of microvessel density in 53 surgical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were comprised of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> tissue that had not spread to the regional lymph nodes (lymph node-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> tissue: 20 specimens), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> tissue had spread to regional lymph nodes (lymph node-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> tissue: 21 specimens), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breast tissue as a control (12 specimens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results: Significant difference was observed between the expression of endoglin on microvessels of lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> tissue (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This significant difference was shown to be due to endoglin expression on lymphatic vessels (p&lt;0.02), rather than on blood vessels (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: These findings are the first to suggest that endoglin expression on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> lymphatic vessels may have diagnostic potential as a discriminator between lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies would be required to confirm this </plain></SENT>
