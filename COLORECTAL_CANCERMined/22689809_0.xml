<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a case-control study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified patients (cases) diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> age 70 to 89 years from January 1998 through December 2002 who died as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> by 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected three matched controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were assigned a referent date (date of diagnosis of the case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy performed from January 1991 through 6 months before the diagnosis/referent date was our primary exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared exposure to colonoscopy in cases and controls by using conditional logistic regression controlling for covariates, stratified by site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We determined endoscopist specialty by linkage to the American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the association between colonoscopy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> varied with endoscopist specialty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 9,458 cases (3,963 proximal [41.9%], 4,685 distal [49.5%], and 810 unknown site [8.6%]) and 27,641 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 11.3% of cases and 23.7% of controls underwent colonoscopy more than 6 months before diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, cases were less likely to have undergone colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR], 0.40; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.43); the association was stronger for distal (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.27) than proximal (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.64) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The strength of the association varied with endoscopist specialty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colonoscopy is associated with a reduced risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, with the association considerably and consistently stronger for distal versus proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The overall association was strongest if colonoscopy was performed by a gastroenterologist </plain></SENT>
