<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that infects the gastrointestinal epithelial cells causing several parasitological and pathological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is incriminated in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in immunosuppressed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 expression is essential for cell cycle progression and its overexpression has been reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This work aimed to study the gastrointestinal changes, including parasitological and pathological changes, induced by C. parvum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in both immunocompetent and in chemically immunosuppressed mice, together with immunohistochemical assessment of cyclin D1 expression in infected tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effectiveness of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010418" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cryptosporidiosis</z:e> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included six groups of mice: group I, infected; group II, infected and immunosuppressed; group III, infected and treated with NTZ; group IV, infected, immunosuppressed, and treated with NTZ; and groups V and VI representing non-infected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to stool examination for oocyst counts and were later sacrificed for intestinal dissection and routine histopathological examination of pathological changes; the endogenous developmental stages of the parasite were counted and immunohistochemical staining was carried out for the determination of cyclin D1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group II showed the highest numbers of oocysts shed and endogenous developmental stages compared to the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intestinal dysplastic changes were seen only in groups I and II, where these changes were in favor of group II compared to group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was seen in four out of 20 mice in group II and was significantly associated with the number of endogenous developmental stages of C. parvum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NTZ was effective in the treatment of Cryptosporidium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, with a greater effect in group III than in group IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: C. parvum is one of the infectious agents that may induce <z:mp ids='MP_0000477'>intestinal dysplasia</z:mp>, including the high-grade category, which occurs particularly in the presence of immune suppression states and elevated endogenous parasite loads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 is a good and useful marker for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0000477'>intestinal dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of NTZ is dependent on the immune status of the infected host </plain></SENT>
