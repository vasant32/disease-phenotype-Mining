<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effects of CERP on LS1034 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells in vitro and also examined possible mechanisms of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric assays were used to measure the percentage of viable cells, cell cycle distribution including the sub-G1 phase (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>), the activities of caspase-8, -9, and -3, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) levels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (ΔΨ(m) ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA damage, nuclei condensation, protein expression, and translocation were examined by Comet assay, 4'-6-diamidino-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48559">phenylindole</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi>) staining, Western blotting, and confocal laser system microscope, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CERP induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as seen by DNA fragmentation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51231">DAPI</z:chebi> staining in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CERP was associated with an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and CERP promoted the activities of caspase-8, -9, and -3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both ROS and Ca(2+) levels were increased by CERP but the compound decreased levels of ΔΨ(m) in LS1034 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laser confocal microscope also confirmed that CERP promoted the expressions of AIF, Endo G, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, and GADD153 to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo>-dependent pathway. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc </plain></SENT>
