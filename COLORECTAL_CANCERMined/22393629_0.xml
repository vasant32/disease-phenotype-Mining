<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 51 cases were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean patient age at time of diagnosis was 48 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio was 1.3 with a female predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of symptoms ranged from 6 months to 1 year </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initially described in industrialized countries, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is now being reported in developing regions, even though data from the literature and Gabonese <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> register (1984-93) indicate otherwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It often involves young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rectum was the most frequent site in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Delayed diagnosis is the main reason for poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Education to improve awareness of early clinical signs as well improvement of diagnostic facilities should allow early detection and better prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in Africa </plain></SENT>
