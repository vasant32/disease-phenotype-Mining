<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence from practice comparisons is important in considering the net benefit of alternative chemotherapy regimens, given expected differences in survival associated with compliance and age of patients treated in real life versus controlled trial settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Practice variation in 5-FU treatment (i.e. 5-FU/leucovorin, FOLFOX, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and XELOX) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from an Australian area health service (n=636) was analyzed between modalities by patient age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage and site using non-parametric tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival analyses (n=434) were conducted over a three-year follow-up period using Cox regression, adjusting for observed confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FOLFOX was the most commonly administered regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5-FU modality was significantly associated with patient age (p&lt;0.001), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage (p&lt;0.001) and site (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analyses found no significant difference in survival with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to 5-FU regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested no survival benefit with the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> to 5-FU modalities in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This raises questions as to the net benefit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, given its known toxicity profile and expense </plain></SENT>
