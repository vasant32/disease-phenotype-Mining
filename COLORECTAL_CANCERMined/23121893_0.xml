<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four cases of bladder <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> (12 primary &amp; 12 metastatic colorectal) were included in the study with urothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (UC) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colonic adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (CA) as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) stains along with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), using the UroVysion probe set, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBAs</z:chebi> presented with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enteric histologic subtype was the most common morphological variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong nuclear with cytoplasmic-membranous staining of β-catenin was seen in 75% of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and only 16.7% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBA</z:chebi> (&lt;10% staining cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although abnormal nuclear staining with E-cadherin was seen in both <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, it was more frequent in former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CK-7, CK-20, villin and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3479">CDX</z:chebi>-2 stains were not helpful in distinguishing the two entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FISH did not reveal any unique differences in chromosomal abnormality between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there was a statistically significant difference in β-catenin and E-cadherin staining between two groups, we did not find any IHC or FISH marker that was specific for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Distinction between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> remains a diagnostic problem and clinical correlation is vital before rendering a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
