<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: It has been recommended that patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> should proceed straight to an endoscopic test to increase speed of diagnosis, using only the information in the general practitioner's referral letter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to establish whether the diagnostic accuracy of the first surgical outpatient assessment is significantly greater than the general practitioner's assessment and if so by what means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Demographic variables, symptoms and signs were collected from the first surgical outpatient assessment letters and the general practitioners' referral letters in 2-week-wait <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> referrals made between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression models derived from both the surgeons' and the general practitioners' letters were compared with receiver operator characteristic curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Variables were collected from 978 2-week-wait <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> referrals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 69 years (range 19-98) and the male to female ratio was 1:2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight referrals were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgeons' models demonstrated significantly greater diagnostic accuracy than general practitioners' models (area under the curve, 0.84 vs 0.73; P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>General practitioners' letters contained significantly less information than surgeons' letters (P &lt; 0.001), but correcting for this did not account for the difference in diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The single variable that accounted for the difference in diagnostic accuracy was examination of the rectum by rigid sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rigid sigmoidoscopy significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of clinical assessment in patients with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If rigid sigmoidoscopy were omitted in a straight-to-test pathway, some patients would be denied the opportunity for immediate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
