<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study also aimed to determine whether the HPV DNA peripheral blood (PB) assay can be used to diagnose HPV-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> tissue, noncancerous colorectal tissue and whole-blood samples were obtained from 96 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, 32 colorectal tissue samples were harvested from patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and 48 whole-blood samples were collected from healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HPV DNA was detected by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus primers, and HPV genotypes were determined by reverse Southern blot and pyrosequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 32 of the 96 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and colorectal tissues from the 32 control patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were negative for HPV DNA (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 48 healthy donors, three had detectable levels of HPV DNA in their PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> did not have significantly higher levels of HPV DNA than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HPV prevalence in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues was higher than that in noncancerous colorectal tissues (P &lt; 0.001) or that in PB samples (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the presence of HPV and demographic or medical characteristics was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HPV 16 was the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> type most frequently detected and was found in 33 (94%) of 35 HPV-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HPV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may be a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, detection of HPV DNA in PB does not appear to reflect the HPV status of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
