<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regarding the prescribed dose, total dose ranged between 40 gray equivalents (GyE) and 80â€‰GyE, and fraction size ranged from 1 to 16 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a median followup period of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-13.1 years), the statistical overall survival rate and local control rate were 71.2% and 91.9% at 2 years after treatment, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related side effects were not a clinical problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When classified by the primary organ, there were 49 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, and 22 cases of others </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carbon ion beam therapy for the metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumors</z:hpo> is a safe therapy, and the therapeutic effect is comparable to the outcome obtained from reported surgical resections </plain></SENT>
