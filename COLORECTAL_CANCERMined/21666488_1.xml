<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to investigate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> (EC) and associated breast, colorectal, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e>, and to define the risk of developing an associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> during follow-up after EC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS/MATERIALS: During a 13-year period, 1028 women had a hysterectomy for EC at our institution and available clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was defined as diagnosis of another malignant disease before or at the time of operation for EC or during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of these 1028 patients, 208 (20%) had a history of another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> besides EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most frequent were <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of the breast (10%), colon-rectum (3%), and ovary (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC)-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> and presence of EC in the lower uterine segment (LUS) had a higher risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within 5 years after hysterectomy (2% and 6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, only LUS involvement remained significantly associated with this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with EC and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> were more likely to be younger and have superficially invasive EC, family history of HNPCC-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and family history of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, only age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 4.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-12.21) and family history of breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.60-9.72) were significantly related to risk of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> associated with EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant risk factors were identified for development of an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> after EC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young age, family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and LUS involvement may indicate the need for more intensive preventive strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and for evaluating the risk of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> in patients with EC </plain></SENT>
