<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recurrence occurs in the majority of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0686619" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymph node metastases</z:e> occur with a high frequency but the methodology for its detection and the impact on the outcome of patients undergoing hepatectomy is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methodology: Twenty-six patients submitted to partial liver resection and systematic lymphadenectomy were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymph nodes considered negative by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin (H&amp;E) staining were analyzed by serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-human pancytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrence-free and overall survivals were compared among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: The mean number of dissected lymph nodes were 6.3 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>H&amp;E showed microscopic involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in 2 patients and 3 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> identified only by IHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 39.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (61.5%) recurred after liver resection and although no statistical difference in survival was demonstrated there was a trend towards shorter recurrence-free survival among microscopic positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> may have impact in the outcome of patients submitted to curative hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A better definition of micrometastases to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> is warranted, as though the potential benefit of hilar lymphadenectomy and chemotherapy selection by hilar lymph node status </plain></SENT>
