<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Family history is a risk factor for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases and as such is often incorporated into clinical practice guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the consistency of the use of family history in selected guidelines for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) and to examine how these definitions influence their screening recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a web-based search, guidelines issued between 2001 and 2011 from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and the WHO were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 21 guidelines were found that included family history information (14 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and seven for T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each guideline, the definition of family history and the way this definition influenced screening recommendations was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses were completed on May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Family history was defined most often as the presence of affected first-degree relatives; the number of such relatives and their ages at diagnosis were considered sometimes in making specific recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The definition of family history and its impact on recommendations varied substantially, even for the same disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the importance of family history as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and T2DM, its use in screening recommendations is inconsistent among guidelines from major organizations; however, differences do not appear large enough to prevent achieving consensus among the guidelines for each disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More standardized recommendations for use of family history in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and T2DM screening guidelines could enhance their utility for prevention </plain></SENT>
