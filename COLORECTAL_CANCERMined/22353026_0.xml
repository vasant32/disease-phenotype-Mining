<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Individuals have a large repertoire of defensive strategies for dealing with personally relevant negative feedback including health risk information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defensive processes are covered in a diverse literature and in theoretical models such as the extended parallel process model, but outside the psychopathological domain, little attention has been paid to the conceptualization and measurement of defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reviewed the broad literature and developed an integrated conceptual model of various defensive strategies to guide measurement development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we developed and tested measures of defensiveness for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, an important public health issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We conducted 2 surveys of independent samples of screening-age adults (n = 226, 287) to iteratively test and refine measures using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our conceptual model informed our development of measures for 4 stages of defensive information processing (attention avoidance, blunting, suppression, and counterarguing) and the literature review identified potential measures for each stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Final subscales ranged from 3 to 8 items, showed good internal reliability, and demonstrated expected patterns of association with other correlates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Items available in both surveys were found to be largely invariant across adherence status to screening guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Future research is planned to replicate and validate these scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that the conceptual model and sample measures will increase understanding of defensive processes and can be used in the design and evaluation of future interventions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk communications to potentially reach and impact more resistant individuals </plain></SENT>
