<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of consistency between composite measures based on process indicators and outcome indicators for 85 Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit database, the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 4732 elective patients with colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and 2239 with rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> treated in 85 hospitals were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> available process indicators were aggregated into five different composite measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of the different composite measures with risk-adjusted postoperative mortality and morbidity was analysed at the patient and hospital level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the patient level, only one of the composite measures was negatively associated with morbidity for rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the hospital level, a strong negative association was found between composite measures and hospital mortality and morbidity rates for rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (p&lt;0.05), and hospital morbidity rates for colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For individual patients, a high score on the composite measures based on process indicators is not associated with better short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at the hospital level, a good score on the composite measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favourable risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates </plain></SENT>
