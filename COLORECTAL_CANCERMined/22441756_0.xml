<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear which factors contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> miss rates, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detected within 3 years after colonoscopy may originate from missed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to determine patient- and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-related factors that influence the miss rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> during colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 406 patients were obtained from a multicenter, randomized back-to-back colonoscopy study investigating the Third Eye Retroscope (TER) in improving <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> detection rate by visualizing hidden areas such as folds and curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to undergo standard colonoscopy followed by colonoscopy with TER, or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Miss rates were calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were categorized for size and location within the colon/rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were computed using adjusted logistic regression models to identify factors independently associated with missed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The miss rate was 25 % (150 /611) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> and 26 % (90 /350) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Miss rates were significantly lower (21 % vs. 29 %) in patients randomized to TER as the first procedure (P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups together, &gt; 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> compared with â‰¤ 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> detected during the first colonoscopy increased the risk of missing additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (adjusted OR = 2.83; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.22 - 6.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenomas</z:mpath> in the left colon compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in the right colon were also more frequently missed (adjusted OR = 1.65; 95 %CI 1.06 - 2.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were missed during colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware that the risk of missing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> is related to patient factors (presence of &gt; 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> factors (left colon location) </plain></SENT>
