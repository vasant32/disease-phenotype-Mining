<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To conduct post-hoc analysis of National CT Colonography Trial data and compare the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomographic (CT) colonography in participants younger than 65 years with those in participants aged 65 years and older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 2600 asymptomatic participants recruited at 15 centers for the trial, 497 were 65 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approval of this HIPAA-compliant study was obtained from the institutional review board of each site, and informed consent was obtained from each subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiologists certified in CT colonography reported lesions 5 mm in diameter or larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Screening detection of large (≥10-mm) histologically confirmed colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was the primary end point; screening detection of smaller (6-9-mm) colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> was a secondary end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences in sensitivity and specificity of CT colonography in the two age cohorts (age &lt; 65 years and age ≥ 65 years) were estimated with bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete data were available for 477 participants 65 years of age or older (among 2531 evaluable participants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> 1 cm or larger for the older participants versus the younger participants was 6.9% (33 of 477) versus 3.7% (76 of 2054) (P &lt; .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, mean estimates for CT colonography sensitivity and specificity among the older cohort were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.644, 0.944) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.779, 0.883), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in the younger group, CT colonography sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.837, 0.967) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.816, 0.899), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Per-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath> sensitivity for large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> for the older and younger populations was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.578, 0.869) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.717, 0.924), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the older and younger groups, per-participant sensitivity was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.565, 0.854) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.745, 0.882) for detecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> 6 mm in diameter or larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For most measures of diagnostic performance and in most subsets, the difference between senior-aged participants and those younger than 65 years was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
