<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study of proteins whose loss-of-function (LOF) alters the growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells can be used to further understand the cellular processes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells depend upon for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A small-scale RNAi screen of ~400 genes conducted in SW480 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells identified several candidate genes as required for the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, most prominently CASP8AP2/FLASH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To understand the function of this gene in maintaining the viability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in an unbiased manner, we generated gene specific expression profiles following RNAi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silencing of CASP8AP2/FLASH resulted in altered expression of over 2500 genes enriched for genes associated with cellular growth and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of CASP8AP2/FLASH function was significantly associated with altered transcription of the genes encoding the replication-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> proteins as a result of the expression of the non-canonical polyA variants of these transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Silencing of CASP8AP2/FLASH also mediated enrichment of changes in the expression of targets of the NFκB and MYC transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings were confirmed by whole transcriptome analysis of CASP8AP2/FLASH silenced cells at multiple time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identified and validated that CASP8AP2/FLASH LOF increases the expression of neurofilament heavy <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (NEFH), a protein recently linked to regulation of the AKT1/ß-catenin pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have used unbiased RNAi based approaches to identify and characterize the function of CASP8AP2/FLASH, a protein not previously reported as required for cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study further defines the role CASP8AP2/FLASH plays in the regulating expression of the replication-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> and shows that its LOF results in broad and reproducible effects on the transcriptome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells including the induction of expression of the recently described <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene NEFH </plain></SENT>
