<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients operated on for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (CRLM), metastatic lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) of the hepatic pedicle is a major prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efficiency of preoperative computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative examination for the diagnosis of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> of hepatic pedicle is prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2008 to June 2010, 76 patients underwent liver resection for CRLM, with systematic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> pedicle dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative CT scan evaluated prospectively location, size, and aspect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>, whereas the surgeon assessed size and consistency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> Results of CT and intraoperative findings were compared with pathologic findings to determine sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 241 nodes were analyzed (3.2 ± 2.1 LN per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systematic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> dissection increased the operative time by a mean of 20 ± 12.5 min, without any specific morbidity or mortality related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in the hepatic pedicle was observed in 15 (20%) patients and were unrelated to the number, size, and location of CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NPV and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of the preoperative CT scan was 85 and 56%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> had a high NPV of 91% with a low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even with the combination of CT and intraoperative evaluation, 27% of the patients with a pathological metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> were not suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Because neither the preoperative CT nor the surgical evaluation accurately predicts metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in the hepatic pedicle, accurate oncological staging require a systematic pedicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> clearance during liver resection for CRLM </plain></SENT>
