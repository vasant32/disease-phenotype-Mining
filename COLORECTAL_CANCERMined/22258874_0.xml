<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study are to review our experience in the surgical management of octogenarians with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and to identify factors that influence the short-term and long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> octogenarians who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> from December 2002 to October 2008 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 204 patients with a median age of 84 years (range, 80-97 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3 (n = 142, 69.6%) and a Charlson Comorbidity Index of ≤3 (n = 128, 62.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was performed in 83 (40.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was seen in 138 patients (67.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had either stage II (n = 75, 36.8%) or III (n = 69, 33.8%) diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 30-day mortality rate was 16.2% (n = 33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, the independent variables predicting worse perioperative complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were age &gt;85 years old, emergency surgery, and Charlson Comorbidity Index &gt;3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up for the 171 remaining patients was 27 months (range, 2-92 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day readmission rate was 2.9% (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one (21.2%) of 146 patients who survived curative surgery developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventy (34.3%) patients died from various etiologies after their first 30 days postoperatively (60% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific with median survival of 15 months and 40% noncancer-related with median survival of 14 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall and disease-free survivals were adversely affected in patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and in those with severe perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for octogenarians with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates which are associated with advanced age, emergency surgery, and Charlson Comorbidity Index &gt;3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival is dependent on the stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and the presence of severe perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
