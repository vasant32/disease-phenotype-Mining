<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) contains longitudinal patient medical records collected within UK primary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on the GPRD and to compare incidence rates for 2007 with those reported by the UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Algorithms were created to identify incident cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on the GPRD and cases were required to have additional medical codes to support the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates for 2007 were calculated using the GPRD data and compared with those reported by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> by age and sex were similar for the two data sources; however, the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on the GPRD was lower than that of the registries, particularly when supporting evidence was required: 57.0 compared with 70.2 per 100 000 per year for men and 42.0 compared with 56.6 per 100 000 per year for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of cases without supporting evidence still resulted in lower rates but increased the GPRD rates to 63.7 and 48.4 for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest discrepancy was observed in the older age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> rates on the GPRD were lower than those reported by UK <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries, especially when requiring supporting evidence in addition to a diagnosis code </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that the requirement of supporting evidence on the GPRD for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> identification may result in some true cases being excluded, particularly in the very elderly </plain></SENT>
