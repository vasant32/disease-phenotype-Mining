<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of anastomotic stricture following colorectal surgery has increased in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This complication is observed in 2-5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated patients and is probably due to the greater number of low anastomoses performed with surgical staplers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed 31 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1446348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative stricture</z:e>, arising from one to nine months post-surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and underwent endoscopy either during routine follow-up or for symptoms of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients (group A) the stricture diameter was less than 4 mm and the patients had symptoms attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328480" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial bowel obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 15 patients (group B), who had difficult bowel movements, the stricture diameter ranged from 4 to 8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with endoscopic dilation using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002571'>achalasia</z:hpo> balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were considered good when the post-dilation anastomosis diameter achieved was at least 13 mm, fair when it was 9-12 mm and poor when it was less than 9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short term results (3 weeks) were good in 27 patients (87.2%), fair in 3 patients (9.6%), and poor in 1 patient (3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After several unsuccessful dilations, the latter was treated by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 3-4 months of the remaining 30 patients revealed good results in 20 (66.6%), fair in 6 (20%), and poor in 4 (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 1 of these 4 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> was observed and a new surgical resection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients a self-expandable metal stent was inserted for 4-6 weeks, with satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient a biodegradable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53354">polydioxanone</z:chebi> stent was inserted with good results after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 3-4 months showed good results in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After 38 months, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0920420" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer recurrence</z:e> in the area of the anastomosis was observed in 1 patient, who was treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> should be considered the first therapeutic approach in case of anastomotic strictures, as it is immediately effective, repeatable, and does not preclude surgery if this should become necessary </plain></SENT>
