<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting EGFR, cetuximab and panitumumab, are established to be new treatment options for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among activating mutations in downstream of EGFR, the KRAS mutation, which is present in 40% of mCRC patients, has shown to be a predictive biomarker for resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy based on Caucasian studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only a small proportion of patients achieved an objective response and benefit from anti-EGFR antibody, even among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> KRAS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other downstream factors in EGFR signaling are now being explored, such as the BRAF, PIK3CA, PTENgenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody, may also exert antitumor effects through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ADCC is influenced by FCrR1 a-H131R and FC7RIKa-V158F polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis of BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN and FcqR genes in KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> patients could narrow down the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-EGFR antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
