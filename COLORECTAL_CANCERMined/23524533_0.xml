<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we sought to elucidate if PF-3758309 (PF-309), a novel p-21 activated kinase inhibitor, efficacy was influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> P-gp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on in vitro proliferation data, a panel of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cell lines were ranked as sensitive or resistant and ABCB1 (P-gp) expression was evaluated by microarray for these cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-gp expression was determined by western blot and activity determined by rhodamine efflux assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knock down of P-gp and pharmacologic inhibition of P-gp to restore PF-309 activity was performed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PF-309 activity was evaluated in vivo in cell line <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft models</z:e> and in primary patient derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts (PDTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice were treated with 25â€‰mg/kg PF-309 orally, twice daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the last day of treatment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and plasma were collected for PF-309 analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we show that ABCB1 gene expression correlates with resistance to PF-309 treatment in vitro and the expression and activity of P-gp was verified in a panel of resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inhibition of P-gp increased the sensitivity of resistant cells, resulting in a 4-100-fold decrease in the IC50s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven cell line xenografts and 12 PDTX models were treated with PF-309 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the cell line xenografts, we found a significant correlation between ABCB1 gene expression profiles and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and plasma concentrations for eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> models (three cell line xenografts and five PDTX models) and a significant correlation was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> concentration and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> concentration is approximately fourfold lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> that express P-gp, verified by western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggests that PF-309 efficacy is influenced by the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> P-gp </plain></SENT>
