<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review by Facey et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(Health Technology Assessment 2007;11(44):iii-iv, xi-267) was used as the evidence base for recommendation development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the review was limited to August 2005, the evidence base was updated to May 2010 using the same search strategies for MEDLINE and EMBASE used in the original review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors of the current systematic review drafted recommendations, which were reviewed, adapted and accepted by consensus by the Ontario provincial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gastrointestinal Disease</z:e> Site Group and a special meeting of clinical experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results from the Facey et al. review for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> included three other systematic reviews and 24 primary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2005 to 2010 updated search included 10 additional systematic reviews and 28 primary studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were developed based on this evidence and accepted by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of PET is not recommended for the diagnosis or staging of clinical stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PET is recommended for determining management and prognosis if conventional imaging is equivocal for the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PET is also not recommended for routine surveillance in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with curative surgery at high risk for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is recommended to determine the site of recurrence in the setting of rising CEA when conventional work-up fails to unequivocally identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, PET is recommended in the preoperative assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> before surgical resection </plain></SENT>
