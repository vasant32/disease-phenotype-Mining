<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that exposure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) promotes cell survival, in part by inducing the expression of the nuclear orphan receptor NR4A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)-induced NR4A2 increased fatty acid oxidation by inducing the expression of multiple proteins in the fatty acid oxidation pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NR4A2 was found to bind directly to Nur77-binding response elements located within the regulatory region of these genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nur77-binding response element binding also resulted in the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and induction of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings suggest that NR4A2 plays a key role as a transcriptional integration point between the eicosanoid and fatty acid metabolic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) is a potential regulator of the adaptive shift to energy utilization via fatty acid oxidation that has been observed in several types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
