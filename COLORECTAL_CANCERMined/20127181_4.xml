<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this case-control-designed 118 unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and 137 sex-and-ages matched healthy controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The C3435T MDR1 gene polymorphism was identified using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased frequencies of the 3435T allele and the 3435TT were observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> compared with controls (P = 0.03; OR, 95% CI; 1.46 for 3435T allele and P = 0.003; OR, 95% CI; 2.2 for 3435TT genotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, frequency of genotype TT was significantly higher in controls compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P = 0.006; OR, 95% CI; 0.49 for TC genotype) </plain></SENT>
