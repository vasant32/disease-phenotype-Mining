<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The existence of such mutations endows the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> with proliferation potential which is independent of external stimuli by growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor of upstream receptor (EGFR] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, anticancer, novel biologic drugs, aimed at inhibiting the EGFR, such as cetuximab, are rendered ineffective in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> harboring activated K-<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Quantification and characterization of activating mutations in a large cohort of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in the Israeli population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results of a mutation analysis kit application in 419 tumor samples collected in Israel during the years 2007-2009 by the diagnostic unit of Teva in Israel--Oncotest-Advantest Ltd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The utilization of a direct, pre-specified mutation kit analysis (TheraScreen: K-ras Mutation Kit) has identified a total rate of 44.8% mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most mutations (82.4%) were identified within codon 12 and the minority on codon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are in concordance with modern series conducted worldwide </plain></SENT>
