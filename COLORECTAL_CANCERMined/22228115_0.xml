<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study is to characterise the lymphatic vessel density (LVD) in the T3 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and to correlate it with N status, grading and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 56 cases of T3 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were retrieved from the pathology's archive of Klinikum Augsburg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> slides were stained immunohistochemically with D2-40 (lymphatic endothelium) and with pancytokeratin to assess the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> budding and lymph vessel density were investigated independently by BM and CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest density of lymphatic vessels was counted both in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> centre (ILVD) and at the periphery of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> (PLVD) within an area of 0.24 mm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Due to the strong intra-observer (BM and CC) difference in ILVD and PLVD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were re-evaluated establishing a consensus that has been used for the further analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between PLVD and ILVD (12 ± 4 versus 6 ± 3; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found a non-significant trend towards high PLVD in the cases with nodal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> versus the negative one, 13 ± 5/hpf versus 11 ± 4 (P = 0.072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> budding and ILVD and PLVD (P = 0.249 and 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> induces lymphangiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A higher PLVD could increase the capability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell to invade the lymphatic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the obvious difficulties in immunohistochemical evaluation and the rather small differences between nodal positive and negative cases in T3 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> seem to limit the clinical value of LVD evaluation </plain></SENT>
