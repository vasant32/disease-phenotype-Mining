<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to genetic aberrations, DNA methylation also plays important roles in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better understand the clinical relevance of these genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we performed an integrative analysis of copy number changes on a genome-wide scale and assessed mutations of TP53, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA and DNA methylation of six marker genes in single glands isolated from 39 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis revealed that genomic losses commonly occurred at 3q26.1, 4q13.2, 6q21.32, 7q34, 8p12-23.3, 15qcen and 18, while gains were commonly found at 1q21.3-23.1, 7p22.3-q34, 13q12.11-14.11, and 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total numbers and lengths of the CNAs were significantly associated with the aberrant DNA methylation and Dukes' stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hierarchical clustering analysis of the array-CGH data suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> could be categorized into four subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> with frequent DNA methylation were most strongly enriched in subgroups with infrequent CNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Dukes' D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were enriched in the subgroup showing the greatest genomic losses, whereas Dukes' C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were enriched in the subgroup with the greatest genomic gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest an inverse relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and aberrant methylation and a positive association between genomic losses and distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> and between genomic gains and lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DNA copy number profiles may be predictive of the metastatic behavior of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
