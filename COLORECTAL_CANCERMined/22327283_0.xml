<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 907 patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection at our institution between 2006 and 2009, chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> developed in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical data for these 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the nine patients with chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> had undergone right hemicolectomy and seven had undergone D3 lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> began to develop the day after commencement of oral intake or the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had no change in diet, one was started on a high-protein and low-fat diet, and six were put on intestinal fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Drainage tubes were removed within 5 days after treatment in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hospital stay was about 2 weeks after surgery and 1 week after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> area, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> fed by the superior mesenteric artery, and D3 lymph node dissection were significantly associated with chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery occurred at an incidence of 1.0%, but was significantly more frequent after surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> fed by the superior mesenteric artery and after D3 lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conservative treatment was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
