<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC) are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the natural history of LGD and its progression to high grade <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (HGD)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in PSC-UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten PSC-UC patients with LGD who underwent surveillance colonoscopy from 1996 to 2011 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raised <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined as a discrete raised lesion located in an area involved by either quiescent or active <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> that was endoscopically resected, while flat <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was defined as the absence of documentation of a raised lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 10 patients with LGD, 3 (30%) progressed to raised HGD over a mean follow-up of 13Â±11months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 10 patients had initial raised LGD while 7 had flat LGD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location of HGD was in the proximal colon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients who progressed to HGD had initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> located in the distal colon and had flat <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for detection of HGD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was 9.4 cases per 100 person years at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with LGD with flat <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> had an incidence rate of 17.8 cases per 100 person years at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HGD occurred more frequently within the first year of initial detection of LGD (23.5 per 100 patient years of follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients with LGD progressed to HGD/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in PSC-UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients progress within the first year of diagnosis of LGD supporting early colectomy in PSC-UC patients with LGD </plain></SENT>
