<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The complete coding region of the K-ras gene and exon 3 and exon 4 of the β-catenin gene isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissues and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissues from 117 CRC subjects were sequenced, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter region were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various characteristics of the 117 subjects were recorded and used in the Cox proportional-hazard model analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three missense mutations, one nonsense mutation, and one deletion were identified in the β-catenin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 2 bp deletion was identified in the K-ras gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the frequencies of mutations in the β-catenin and K-ras genes were less pronounced in Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subjects as compared with other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter region were detected in 73.5% (n=86/117) of the subjects, which was higher than in other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylations in the RASSF1A promoter have no significant effect on hazards for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> caused in Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No interaction between 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy and methylations of the RASSF1A promoter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mutation frequencies of β-catenin and K-ras genes in Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients are very low, which may suggest that they are not the dominant factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> occurrence and prognosis in Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Methylation of RASSF1A promoter is independent of the prognosis for Taiwanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taiwanese subjects differ from subjects of other populations with regard to β-catenin, K-ras, and RASSF1A presentations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
