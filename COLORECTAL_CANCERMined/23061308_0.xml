<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Inter-observer reliability on VEGF and MVD measurement was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Anti-VEGF and anti-factor CD34 monoclonal antibodies immunohistochemical staining was performed in 40 randomly selected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> specimens of non-stage-IV patients who underwent curative resection using </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive in 25% or more <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells was categorized as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intensity of VEGF expression was graded in a semiquantitative fashion, ranging from 0 to 2 Tumor MVD was determined by counting any endothelial cells stained with CD34 per two randomly selected fields at x200 magnification in each slide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between VEGF expression and MVD was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inter-observer agreement was assessed by comparing the results of VEGF and MVD measurements made by two pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A moderate correlation was found between the percentage of positive immunoreactive cells and the intensity of VEGF immunoreactive staining (correlation value of 0.436, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MVD was found having no correlation with both the percentage of positive immunoreactive cells and intensity of VEGF immunoreactive staining (the correlation value of -0.056, p = 0.732 and 0.108, p = 0.506, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither MVD nor VEGF expression in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissue was found having a significant correlation with any common reported prognostic histopathologic indictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In counting CD34-stained endothelial cells, this study revealed a high intra-observer correlation coefficient of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.715-0.955) for the first pathologist and 0.913 (95% CI: 0.782-0.965) for the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High inter-observer reliability was found in both MVD and VEGF measurement with a substantial agreement (agreement: 95%, kappa = 0.643) between the two pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, there was no significant relationship between MVD and VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study revealed a high intra and inter-observer reliability on VEGF and MVD measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neither MVD nor VEGF expression provided predictive value of advanced or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies on larger sample size would help validate these results </plain></SENT>
