<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether such genetic variability in VEGF contributes to susceptibility of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (CRA), a presumably <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032927" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">precancerous state</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this research, two aforementioned polymorphisms were investigated for CRA susceptibility in a Chinese case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological risk factors were collected through questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma VEGF levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Taqman-Probe assay was used to determine genotypes in 224 CRA patients and 200 CRA-free controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinicopathological data of each sample were collected for further correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to data analysis males, cigarette smokers, patients who carry <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> or familial antecedent of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were significantly associated with CRA risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma VEGF levels of CRA patients were higher than those of controls (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This difference is independent of genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The carriers with 936CT and CT+TT had higher risk of CRA in comparison with controls (CT vs. CC, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.23-3.25, P = 0.006; CT+TT vs. CC, OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.28-3.26, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>936-T allele was associated with increased risk of CRA (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.25-2.91, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both CRA and control show no difference in the genotype of 1498C/T and the allele frequency of C-/T- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CRA patients with haplotype 1498T+936T presented significantly higher risk than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> 1498T+936C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients carrying 936CT+TT and 936-T allele demonstrated a tendency for villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CRA patients have elevated plasma VEGF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The VEGF 936C/T polymorphism and 1498T+936T haplotype were found to be associated with increased CRA susceptibility </plain></SENT>
