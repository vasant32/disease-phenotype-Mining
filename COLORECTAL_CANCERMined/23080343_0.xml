<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological features and prognoses of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and the relationship between surveillance colonoscopy and UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records of 1,274 UC patients who required surgery between 1984 and 2010 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 83 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (107 sections) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were extracted from the database, along with their clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate of the UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> group was 89 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rate was 100 % in stages 0 and II, 96 % in stage I, 56 % in stage III, and 0 % in stage IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy was performed for 40 of the 83 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 40 patients, 30 with UC who underwent surveillance colonoscopies and 22 of 43 patients without surveillance colonoscopies were in stages 0 to I (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The number of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients who are diagnosed by surveillance colonoscopy is increasing, and many of them are detected in the very early stages (stages 0 or I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the survival rate of UC-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is better than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy proofs efficient as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are detected in earlier stages </plain></SENT>
