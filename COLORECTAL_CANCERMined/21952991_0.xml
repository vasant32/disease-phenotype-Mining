<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Variants of the mutY homolog gene MutYH, a DNA repair gene, are associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; however, it remains unclear whether these variants also are associated with the risk of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> associated with MutYH variants in a unique ethnic group of Sephardi Jews in Israel with a high prevalence of MutYH mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study participants were 930 Sephardi Jewish women of North African origin who were recruited into the population-based case-control <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> in Northern Israel Study (BCINIS) either as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cases or as healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants contributed a blood sample and completed an interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two MutYH variants, a glycine-to-aspartic acid substitution at codon 396 (G396D) and a tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 179 (Y179C), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Sephardi Jews, among the healthy controls, 20 women (3.7%) were homozygote or heterozygote carriers of the G396D variant, and 4 women (0.7%) were heterozygote carriers of the Y179C variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> cases had a 6.7% prevalence of G396D, yielding a significantly elevated risk estimate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.39; P = .039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> detected in carriers with MutYH variants were similar in characteristics to those without MutYH variants, as was the age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of variants in MutYH, although not very common, may have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in Jews of North African origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identification of such carriers and special surveillance protocols may be warranted </plain></SENT>
