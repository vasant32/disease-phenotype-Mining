<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is poorer in patients of lower socioeconomic level, or living far from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> reference centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate the impact of material deprivation and geographical remoteness on the uptake of colonoscopy after a positive screening faecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from two large French average-risk population-based trials comparing two faecal occult blood tests were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compliance with colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test was analysed using a logistic model and a Cox model considering time between faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Covariates studied were sex, age, distance to nearest gastroenterologist, distance to regional capital, and Townsend's deprivation score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Amongst 4320 eligible subjects, 4131 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of colonoscopy was 83.8%, within a median time of 66.0 days after faecal occult blood test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distance to regional capital (p-trend=0.02) and study centre (p&lt;0.0001) were independently associated with colonoscopy uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time from positive faecal occult blood test to colonoscopy, was associated only with distance to the regional capital (p&lt;0.0001, multivariate model stratified on study centre) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Geographical remoteness but not material deprivation was responsible for lower uptake of colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Healthcare decision-makers should focus on geographical remoteness to promote equal access to diagnostic procedures in faecal occult blood test <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening programmes </plain></SENT>
