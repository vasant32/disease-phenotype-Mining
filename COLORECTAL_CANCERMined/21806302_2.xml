<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Risk perception is important for motivating health behavior (e.g., Janz &amp; Becker, 1984), but different measures of the construct may change how important that relationship appears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two studies, we examined associations between four measures of risk perception, health behavior intentions and possible behavioral determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants in these studies, who were due for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening, read an online message about the importance of screening to reduce the chance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined bivariate and multivariate associations between risk perception measures, including absolute, comparative, and feelings-of-risk, and behavioral intentions to screen, general worry, and knowledge and attitudes related to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results across the two studies were consistent, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk perception measures being correlated with intentions and attitudes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses revealed that feelings-of-risk was most predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables, with the exception of general worry, for which comparative measures were the most predictive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Researchers interested in risk perception should assess feelings-of-risk along with more traditional measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those interested in influencing health behavior specifically should attempt to increase feelings of vulnerability rather than numerical risk </plain></SENT>
