<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients underwent curative resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> between January 2004 and December 2007, with a follow up period that ranged from 3 to 66 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, early postoperative 30 day mortality and morbidity in addition to the effects of Dukes' stage, type of resection, number and size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, resection margin, sex, age and chemotherapy protocol on three year survival were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analyses of survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was evaluated using Cox regression method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of P&lt;0.05 was accepted as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 7.14% and 0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients died during the follow-up period of 3 to 66 months (mean, 40.40Â±12.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median survival was 56 months and three year survival rate was 71.30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred in 11 patients (26.00%) after liver resection and additional surgery was performed for two of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At univariate analysis, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (&lt;4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size (&lt;4 cm), type of resection and negative resection margins were significantly correlated with three year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sex, age, Dukes' stage, synchronous or metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, recurrence and chemotherapy protocol were not predictive of long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size&gt;4 cm and presence of more than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> before surgery were associated with a 5.89 and 2.18-fold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Curative resection is one of the most important treatment options that can demonstrate long-term survival for patients </plain></SENT>
