<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to compare the direct costs of laparoscopic surgery (LS) and open surgery (OS) in the treatment of mid or low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The records of 130 LS patients and 125 OS patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospital stay after surgery and overall complication rates within three months of surgery were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The LS group had significantly higher median costs than the OS group ($7,467.30 vs. $5,667.00; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median hospital costs during hospitalization for surgery were higher in the LS group ($7,436.60 vs. $5,626.60; P &lt; 0.001), but hospital costs for management of early postoperative complications were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher direct costs of LS were mainly due to the more expensive consumables and equipment needed for LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further study is needed to determine whether the higher direct costs of LS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> are balanced by advantages of LS over OS, such as better short-term outcomes and cosmetic effect </plain></SENT>
