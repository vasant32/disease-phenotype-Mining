<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to clarify the risk factors for L-OHP-related hypersensitivity reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data from 108 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were analyzed, who were treated with L-OHP-containing regimens, FOLFOX4 and/or mFOLFOX6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factors examined included demographic data, preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergies</z:e>, laboratory test data, treatment regimen, treatment line of therapy, pretreatment with steroids, total number of cycles and cumulative amount of L-OHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of grade 1/2 and grade 3/4 hypersensitivity reactions were found at 13.0% (14/108) and 9.3% (10/108), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Female (P = 0.037), preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergies</z:e> (P = 0.004) and lower level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (P = 0.003) were risk factors for grade 1/2 hypersensitivity reactions, and higher neutrophil count (P = 0.043) and lower monocyte count (P = 0.007) were for grade 3/4 reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total number of cycles were larger in the patients with grade 3/4 reactions than those without reactions (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Further extensive examination with a large number of patients is needed to establish a patient management strategy </plain></SENT>
