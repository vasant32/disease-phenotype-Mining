<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hand-foot syndrome</z:e> (HFS) is the most common adverse event induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some clinicians think that HFS is a type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> limited to the hands and feet and can be prevented with a COX-2 inhibitor (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a single-center, prospective randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From August 2008 to December 2010, stage II and III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy enrolled in the trial voluntarily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were divided randomly into two groups treated with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adverse events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Grade 1 and grade 2 HFS were more common in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> group than in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> group (74.6% versus 57.4%, P = 0.034, 29.6% versus 14.7% P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.003) and the level of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (P = 0.048, P = 0.014) affected the incidence of grade 1 and 2 HFS, as determined by log-rank analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> was the only factor that affected the incidence of ≥ grade 1 HFS [Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.556, P = 0.001] and ≥ grade 2 HFS (HR: 0.414, P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> can be used effectively and safely to prevent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-related HFS </plain></SENT>
