<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently our group completed a genome-wide linkage study investigating Australian and Spanish families with inherited risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A minor linkage peak from that study located on chromosome 1 correlates with the location of a known <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk-modifying gene, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthase (PTGS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTGS2 encodes the inducible <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthase enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">Prostaglandins</z:chebi> are implicated in the initiation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of PTGS2 in a small subset of affected individuals identified a high frequency of the minor C allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs5275 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then genotyped the rs5275 polymorphism in 183 affected and 223 unaffected individuals from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposed families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tests for association in the presence of linkage were made using family-based association tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The C allele was found to be significantly associated (P&lt;0.01) with diagnosis of hereditary non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P=0.0094, dominant model) and an earlier age of diagnosis (P=0.0089, heterozygous-advantage model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, by stratifying the age of diagnosis data, we observed a speculative gender-discordant effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Relative to other groups, female CC carriers were diagnosed less when young, but by 60 years of age were the most at risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CT carriers of both genders showed a consistently earlier diagnosis relative to TT carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest potential differential age-and gender-dependent efficacies of chemopreventative COX-2 inhibitors in the context of non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 27 March 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.53 </plain></SENT>
