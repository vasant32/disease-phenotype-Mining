<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Animal studies have demonstrated that dietary supplementation with flaxseed oil inhibits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicate that walnuts have strong antiproliferative properties against <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells in vitro but no previous study has assessed the effects of walnuts in vivo or performed a joint evaluation of flaxseed oil and walnuts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dietary walnuts on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in vivo and to comparatively evaluate their efficacy in relation to flaxseed oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HT-29 human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells were injected in 6-wk-old female <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 1-wk acclimation period, mice (n = 48) were randomized to diets containing ∼19% of total energy from walnuts, flaxseed oil, or corn oil (control) and were subsequently studied for 25 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor growth</z:e> rate was significantly slower in walnut-fed and flaxseed-fed mice compared with corn oil-fed animals (P &lt; 0.05) by 27% and 43%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, final <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> weight was reduced by 33% and 44%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05 versus control); the differences between walnut and flaxseed diets did not reach significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no differences among groups in metabolic and hormonal profile, serum <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity, or <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, walnuts and flaxseed oil significantly reduced serum expression levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (by 30% and 80%, respectively), and approximately doubled total necrotic areas despite smaller <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> sizes (P &lt; 0.05 versus control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dietary walnuts significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0005602'>decreased angiogenesis</z:mp> (CD34 staining; P = 0.017 versus control), whereas this effect did not reach significance in the flaxseed oil group (P = 0.454 versus control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that walnuts in the diet inhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> growth by suppressing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in humans and explore underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
