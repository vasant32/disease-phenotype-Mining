<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 44 patients with unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treated with FOLFIRI regimen as second-line, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based regimen had previously failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab was concomitantly used in 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classification of the Köhne's index revealed high risk in 22 patients, intermediate risk in 7 patients, and low risk in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate was 13.6% in the patients with high risk(H group) and 27.3% in the patients with intermediate or low risk(non-H group)(p=0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease control rate was 50% in the H group and 68.2% in the non-H group (p=0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the H group, the median progression -free survival time was 4.1 months and in the non-H group it was 7.1 months (p=0.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the H group, the non-H group showed significantly better overall survival (10.8 months vs 23.9 months, p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients has received hepatectomy (conversion therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the predictive value of Köhne's index is limited in terms of the effect of shrinkage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, including conversion therapy </plain></SENT>
