<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Accurate mutation detection assays are strongly needed for use in routine molecular pathology analyses to aid in the selection of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> for targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high-resolution melting (HRM) assay is an ideal prescreening tool, and SNaPshot analysis offers a straightforward genotyping system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our present study was determined to compare these mutation testing methods on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the performance of HRM, followed by cycle sequencing (HRM-sequencing); multiplex PCR assay, followed by SNaPshot analysis (multiplex mutation assay); and a successor assay using HRM, followed by SNaPshot (HRM-SNaPshot) for mutation analysis of both KRAS (codon 12/13/61) and BRAF (codon 600/601) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a series of 195 FFPE-derived DNA specimens, a high genotypic concordance between HRM-sequencing and multiplex mutation assay was found (κ, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1), underlining the potential of a combined HRM-SNaPshot approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In reconstruction experiments, the analytical sensitivity of HRM-SNaPshot was twofold to fourfold higher than HRM-sequencing and multiplex mutation assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, HRM-SNaPshot had a good performance rate (99%) on FFPE <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-derived DNA, and mutation detection was highly concordant with the predecessor assays (κ for both, 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of BRAF and KRAS mutations is mutually exclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HRM-SNaPshot is an attractive method for mutation analysis in pathology, given its good performance rate on FFPE-derived DNA, high analytical sensitivity, and prescreening approach </plain></SENT>
