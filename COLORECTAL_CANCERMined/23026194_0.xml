<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new mechanism involving the epithelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule (EPCAM)/TACSTD1 gene has been shown to be responsible in cases with abnormal MSH2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of interest, 3' exons deletions of the EPCAM gene, which is located upstream of MSH2 in chromosome 2, are associated with MSH2 promoter hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EPCAM protein, expressed in epithelial tissues, is encoded by the EPCAM/TACSTD1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our study's aim was to explore EPCAM expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> of MSH2-associated LS cases to evaluate the usefulness of EPCAM protein expression in the algorithm approach to LS population screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We included a total of 19 MSH2-negative colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> from 14 different patients in whom we were able to perform a complete germ-line analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients showed a deleterious germ-line mutation that involved the MSH2 gene in 3 instances and the EPCAM gene exon 9 in 6 instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients harboring the EPCAM mutation belonged to the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, EPCAM expression loss was seen in only 5 tumors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them from patients showing a germ-line EPCAM deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of interest, 6 tumors from 3 different patients carrying the same germ-line EPCAM deletion showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EPCAM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, owing to the high specificity of EPCAM protein expression to identify LS patients carrying an EPCAM deletion, we recommend adding EPCAM immunohistochemistry to the LS diagnostic algorithm in MSH2-negative colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
