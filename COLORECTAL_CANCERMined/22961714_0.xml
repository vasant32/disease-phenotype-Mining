<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We made serial (1) H MRS measurements of hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in patients over the time course of a 24-week chemotherapeutic regimen to determine whether (1) H MRS could be used to monitor the progression of chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with stage III or IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>, folinic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (n=21) or hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine with systemic irinotecan (n=13) were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A (1) H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectrum was acquired from the liver during a breath hold and the ratio of fat to fat+water (FFW) was calculated to give a measure of hepatic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (HTGCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methodology was histologically validated in 18 patients and the reproducibility was assessed in 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients completed baseline, 6-week and 24-week (1) H MRS examinations and one was censored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 26 patients (50%) showed an increase in FFW after completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients (23%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>hepatic steatosis</z:hpo> and two patients converted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> to nonsteatotic liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients whose 6-week hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels had increased significantly relative to baseline also had a high probability of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> elevation relative to baseline at the completion of treatment </plain></SENT>
