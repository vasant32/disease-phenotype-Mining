<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generally, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> are resistant to anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence support a critical role for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) during colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and its role in chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused our interest on the role played by COX-2 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced in HT-29 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9908">ursolic acid</z:chebi> (UA), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36615">triterpenoid</z:chebi> found in a large variety of plants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We showed that UA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and that COX-2 was overexpressed only in apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that this overexpression was mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway as inhibiting its activation using a p38-specific inhibitor, SB 203580, abrogated COX-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting COX-2 expression either by using a p38-specific inhibitor or COX-2-specific siRNA <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated that COX-2 was involved in a resistance mechanism to UA-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HT-29 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were able to trigger a resistance mechanism by overexpressing a protein such as COX-2 to delay their <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrated that this resistance mechanism was independent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production as the addition of the specific COX-2 activity inhibitor, NS-398, did not affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in UA-treated cells </plain></SENT>
