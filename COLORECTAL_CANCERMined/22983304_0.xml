<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brivanib has a single asymmetric center derived from a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35681">secondary alcohol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential for chiral inversion was investigated in incubations with liver subcellular fractions and in animals and humans after oral doses of brivanib <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32439">alaninate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incubations of [¹⁴C]brivanib <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32439">alaninate</z:chebi> with liver microsomes and cytosols from rats, monkeys, and humans followed by chiral chromatography resulted in two radioactive peaks, corresponding to brivanib and its enantiomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the enantiomeric metabolite relative to brivanib in microsomal and cytosolic incubations of different species in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> ranged from 11.6 to 15.8 and 0.8 to 3.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proposed mechanism of inversion involves the oxidation of brivanib to a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> metabolite, which is subsequently reduced to brivanib and its enantiomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After oral doses of brivanib <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32439">alaninate</z:chebi> to rats and monkeys, the enantiomeric metabolite was a prominent drug-related component in plasma, with the percentages of area under the curve (AUC) at 94.7 and 39.7%, respectively, relative to brivanib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In humans, the enantiomeric metabolite was a minor circulating component, with the AUC &lt;3% of brivanib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological studies indicated that brivanib and its enantiomer had similar potency toward the inhibition of VEGF receptor-2 and FGF receptor-1 kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of low plasma concentration in humans, the enantiomeric metabolite was not expected to contribute significantly to target-related pharmacology of brivanib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, adequate exposure in the toxicology species suggested no specific safety concerns with respect to exposure to the enantiomeric metabolite </plain></SENT>
