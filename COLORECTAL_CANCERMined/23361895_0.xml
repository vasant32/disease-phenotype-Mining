<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative colonoscopic examinations were performed in 495 patients with GC who underwent gastrectomy between January 2009 and December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To compare the prevalence of CRN in these patients with that in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population, we selected 495 sex- and age-matched persons who underwent colonoscopies for health screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for CRN were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of CRN was 41.8 % (414/990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of overall CRN, high-risk CRN, and colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) were significantly higher in the GC group than in the control group (overall CRN: 48.9 % vs. 34.7 %; high-risk CRN: 28.3 % vs. 13.5 %; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: 2.6 % vs. 0.2 %; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of GC [odds ratio (OR), 1.82; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.4-2.38; P &lt; 0.001], age ≥50 years (OR, 2.58; 95 % CI, 1.75-3.81; P &lt; 0.001), and male sex (OR, 2.28; 95 % CI, 1.72-3.02; P &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for overall CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with GC, age ≥40 years (OR, 3.22; 95 % CI, 1.24-8.37; P = 0.016) and male sex (OR, 3.21; 95 % CI, 2.17-4.76; P &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for overall CRN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of coexisting CRN, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, was higher in patients with GC than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative colonoscopy is strongly indicated in patients with GC who are male and/or ≥40 years of age </plain></SENT>
