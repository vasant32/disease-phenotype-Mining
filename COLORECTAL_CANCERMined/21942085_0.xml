<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that, on ligand binding, triggers the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway which is mainly associated with cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drugs targeting EGFR have recently entered clinical practice and have proven to be effective in providing clinical benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of mutated KRAS alleles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is a predictive marker of anti-EGFR drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, alterations of other members of the <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway may also be such predictive markers, especially the BRAF mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the identification of KRAS and BRAF mutations may be important in predicting resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We looked at the Tm analysis for simultaneous detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations using a quenching probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oligonucleotide probes modified with certain fluorescent dyes at 5'-end <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> are quenched by their interaction with a uniquely positioned <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the probe is hybridized with target DNA, its fluorescence is quenched by the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> in the target DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as the temperature is raised, perfect match probes and miss match probes dissociate at different temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dissociated probes generate fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This simple and rapid method for simultaneous detection of these mutations is useful in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
