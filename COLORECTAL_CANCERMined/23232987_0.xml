<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) should be aimed primarily at achieving a combination of surgical-oncologic radicalness and the highest possible quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, surgical therapy for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has tended toward less radical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The question regarding changes in survival and recurrence rates still is unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review of patients surgically treated in our department for T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> from January 1990 to December 2010 (n = 223) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-specific parameters, local recurrence, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The different treatment options used were strictly separated for a more detailed workup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Radical resection (RR) was performed for 57.1 %, local resection (LR) for 14.8 %, and an endoscopic approach (EA) for 28.1 % of the study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After receipt of the histology report, 35.7 % of the patients initially resected nonradically underwent reoperation, mostly using RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients experienced a local recurrence over time (3.6 %): one after initial RR, three after LR, and three after EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systemic recurrence occurred for nine patients (4.6 %) over time, six of whom had undergone initial RR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-risk criteria were shown for 20 T1 CRCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For 60 % (12/20) of the patients, initial RR was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Radical reoperation was performed for 75 % of the nonradically treated high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One high-risk patient without reoperation experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival rate was 87.2 %, itemized for the defined subgroups as follows: 83.9 % for RR, 82.8 % for LR, and 58.2 % for EA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> had a distinctly higher incidence of local recurrence after EA or LR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Explicit workup in terms of risk classification is crucial to reducing the risk of local and systemic recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A nonradical approach should be only a second option for patients with T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, namely, those solely in clearly low-risk situations or those with distinct comorbidities </plain></SENT>
