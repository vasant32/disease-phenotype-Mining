<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in this study had previously failed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and irinotecan-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> (6 mg/m(2) intravenously/i.v.) on day 1 in combination with either oral UFT (500 mg/m(2)) and oral leucovorin (LV) (30 mg) on days 1-14 every 3 weeks (group A) or infusional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) by deGramont regimen with i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LV (200 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 2, every 2 weeks (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine MCRC patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of them were in group A and 17 in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three were evaluable for clinical efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical benefit in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 30.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median progression free survival (PFS) was 6 months (95% confidence interval/ CI 4-8) and median overall survival (OS) 9 months (95% CI 6.5-11.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median PFS was 3 months (95% CI 2.4-3.6) in group A and 7 months (95% CI 5.1-8.9) in group B (p=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 7 months (95% CI 4.3-9.7) in group A and 12 months (95% CI 5.4-18.6) in group B (p=0.422) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and fluoropyrimidines was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common severe toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> in combination with fluoropyrimidines is safe and active in heavily-pretreated MCRC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This combination remains a viable option in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, better therapies are urgently needed </plain></SENT>
