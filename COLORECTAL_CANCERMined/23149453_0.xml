<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies have observed that poor health literacy is associated with less knowledge and screening practice of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), little is known about whether eHealth literacy is associated with these variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study examined associations between eHealth literacy, knowledge of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were analyzed for 2970 Japanese adults (men, 49.9%; mean age±SD, 39.7±10.9 years) who responded to an Internet-based cross-sectional survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, its risk factors and screening practice, previous experience of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, score on the Japanese version of the eHEALS (J-eHEALS), sociodemographic attributes (sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and household income level), and frequency of Internet usage were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic attributes and frequency of Internet usage were used as control variables in the multiple regression and logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: eHealth literacy was positively associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge (β=.116, &lt;.001), when the covariables of both eHealth literacy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge were used in the multiple regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, after controlling for sociodemographic factors, which were significantly associated with eHealth literacy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practice, an increase of 1 point in the eHEALS score signified that participants were 1.03 times (95% CI=1.01-1.05) more likely to undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internet users with high eHealth literacy are more likely to have knowledge and previous screening practice related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> compared to those with low eHealth literacy </plain></SENT>
