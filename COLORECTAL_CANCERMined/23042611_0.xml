<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adipokines produced by the adipose tissue are linked to some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visfatin is an adipokine shown to be a biomarker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) has been reported to play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship between visfatin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has been established, the underlying mechanism has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the molecular mechanism governing the interaction between visfatin stimulation and SDF-1 expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that visfatin stimulation led to an increase in the expression and secretion of SDF-1 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> DLD-1 and SW48 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiments involving specific inhibitors and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> demonstrated that the activation of ERK and p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are critical for visfatin-induced SDF-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of transcription factor binding using ELISA and luciferase reporter assays revealed that visfatin increased NF-κB- and AP-1-DNA-binding activities in DLD-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 activation blocked the visfatin-induced expression and activity of the SDF-1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effect of visfatin on DLD-1 signaling and SDF-1 expression was mediated by β1 integrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, these findings provide novel insights pertaining to the pathophysiological role of visfatin in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
