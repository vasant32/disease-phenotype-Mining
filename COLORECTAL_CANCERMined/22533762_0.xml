<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> is a promising endoscopic therapy with a high rate of successful en bloc resection, ESD for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> is not a health-care service provided by Japanese public heath insurance, yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Now, ESD for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> has been approved as an 'advanced medical treatment' system, which is a partial-care service provided by Japanese public health insurance with individual payment of medical expenses, and the indication for ESD for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> has been under debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our hospital, a total of 348 colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> underwent ESD using the FlexKnife and the FlushKnife, and 317 lesions (91%) were resected en bloc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforation</z:mpath> occurred in eight cases (2%) and they were not critical and did not require emergent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 16 cases (4%) and they were able to be controlled without transfusion and were not critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major impact of the advanced medical treatment system on clinical practice in our hospital was the increased incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size in the lesions that underwent ESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the application of the advanced medical treatment system resulted in careful selection of lesions for ESD while maintaining the principle of en bloc resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We expect that a new, revised indication that covers recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> after endoscopic therapy will be indicated when ESD for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> becomes a health-care service provided by Japanese public health insurance </plain></SENT>
