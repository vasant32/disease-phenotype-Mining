<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postintervention health outcomes have not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine health outcomes associated with randomization to treatment with conjugated equine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> (CEE) among women with prior hysterectomy after a mean of 10.7 years of follow-up through August 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The intervention phase was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 0.625 mg/d of CEE compared with placebo in 10,739 US postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with prior hysterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up continued after the planned trial completion date among 7645 surviving participants (78%) who provided written consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) and invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A global index of risks and benefits included these primary outcomes plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, hip fracture, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postintervention risk (annualized rate) for CHD among women assigned to CEE was 0.64% compared with 0.67% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.25), 0.26% vs 0.34%, respectively, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51-1.09), and 1.47% vs 1.48%, respectively, for total mortality (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84-1.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was no longer elevated during the postintervention follow-up period and was 0.36% among women receiving CEE compared with 0.41% in the placebo group (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.64-1.24), the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was lower at 0.17% vs 0.27%, respectively (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.98), and the risk of hip fracture did not differ significantly and was 0.36% vs 0.28%, respectively (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.88-1.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over the entire follow-up, lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> incidence in the CEE group persisted and was 0.27% compared with 0.35% in the placebo group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Health outcomes were more favorable for younger compared with older women for CHD (P = .05 for interaction), total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (P = .007 for interaction), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P = .04 for interaction), total mortality (P = .04 for interaction), and global index of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases (P = .009 for interaction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy followed up for 10.7 years, CEE use for a median of 5.9 years was not associated with an increased or decreased risk of CHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, hip fracture, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, or total mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
