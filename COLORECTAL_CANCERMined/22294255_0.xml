<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phase II study tested the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>, and cetuximab with or without bevacizumab as first-line treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 850 mg/m2 PO twice daily for 14 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg/ m2 IV day 1, and cetuximab 400 mg/m2 IV loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, and 15 with (arm A) or without (Arm B) bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg IV day 1 every 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> samples were collected and retrospectively analyzed for KRAS mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was response rate, with time to progression (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and overall survival (OS) as secondary objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (12 in arm A, 11 in arm B) were enrolled onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 25.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both treatments were well tolerated, with expected higher rates of grade 1/2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in arm A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 54% (36.4% in arm A and 72.7% in arm B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to progression was 8.7 months in arm A and 14.4 months in arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median survival was 18.0 months in arm A and 42.5 months in arm B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study was prematurely terminated after other studies reported inferior outcomes with dual antibody therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although terminated early, the study supports the detrimental effect of combining VEGF and EGFR inhibition in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
