<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> as the sole site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Historical treatment options were limited to resection or conventional radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a rational treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study reviews our experience with SBRT for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: Fourteen histologically confirmed hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in 11 consecutive patients were identified between November, 2004 and June, 2009 at Georgetown University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CT-based treatment planning; a few also had MRI or PET/CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had fiducial markers placed under CT guidance and were treated using the CyberKnife system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment response and toxicities were examined; survival and local control were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: Most patients were treated to a single hepatic lesion (n = 8), with a few treated to two lesions (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median treatment volume was 99.7 cm(3), and lesions were treated to a median BED(10) of 49.7 Gy (range: 28-100.8 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 21 months; median survival was 16.1 months, with 2 year actuarial survival of 25.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One year local control was 72% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among patients with post-treatment imaging, eight had stable disease (80%) and two had progressive disease (20%) at first follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 1-2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and alterations in liver function tests; there was one grade 3 toxicity (elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>), and no grade 4-5 toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Discussion: SBRT is safe and feasible for the treatment of limited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results compare favorably with outcomes from previous studies of SBRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to better define patient eligibility, study the role of combined modality treatment, optimize treatment parameters, and characterize quality of life after treatment </plain></SENT>
