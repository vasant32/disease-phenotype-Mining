<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mammalian target of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (mTOR) represents an attractive target for anticancer therapy, but its role in suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell growth by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (Indo, a nonselective COX-2 inhibitor) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44445">nimesulide</z:chebi> (Nim, a selective COX-2 inhibitor) on mTOR signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in vitro and in vivo to determine the dependence of this effect on COX-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines with varying COX-2 expression levels were treated with Indo and Nim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot test was performed to detect mTOR-related components (mTOR, p70s6Â K, and 4EBP1), and cell viability, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HCT116 and SW1116 cells were injected into athymic <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice to establish a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1520166" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">xenograft model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment with Nim, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume, mTOR signaling, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were evaluated in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HT29 and SW1116 cells were also treated with Nim after transfection with COX-2-specific small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) to assess dependence of COX-2 on mTOR signaling under drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both Indo and Nim reduced mTOR signaling activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells that differ in their COX-2 expression in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Indo and Nim could reduce the mTOR signaling activity after COX-2 silencing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: mTOR signaling is involved in Indo- and Nim-mediated suppression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> growth via a COX-2 independent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study unveils a novel mechanism through which COX-2 inhibitors exerts their anticancer effects and further emphasizes targeting mTOR signaling in anticancer therapy </plain></SENT>
