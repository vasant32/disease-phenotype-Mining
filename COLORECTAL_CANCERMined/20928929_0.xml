<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subgroups sharing similar psychosocial characteristics may be targeted with specific intervention strategies aimed at increasing participation in screening, which could lead to increased early detection and decreased morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The male African American veterans in our sample (n = 260) had a mean age of 57.3 (SD = 7.3) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study employs latent class analysis, a quantitative-based, audience segmentation method to identify homogeneous subgroups of African American men with similar psychosocial characteristics related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, potentially in need of different health information and intervention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Latent class regression was used to examine the relationships among latent class structure and demographic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were four psychosocial risk classes across the three screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant subset of men had psychosocial characteristics indicative of willingness to be screened for each test (colonscopy = 21.8%, sigmoidoscopy = 31.5%, and FOBT = 10.8%), although they were currently non-adherent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men who received a past screening test, had greater than a high school education, or were married were more likely to be represented in a latent class indicative of being prepared for getting colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sociodemographic variables were unrelated to FOBT latent class structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Segmenting our sample of male African American veterans based on psychosocial risk characteristics can inform the development of more precisely targeted interventions for African American men who are non-adherent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
