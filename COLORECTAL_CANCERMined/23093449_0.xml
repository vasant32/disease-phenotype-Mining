<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of an <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> resulting from bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or anastomotic leakage has been suggested to enhance recurrence rates in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, it is unknown if bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or anastomotic leakage has prognostic significance in early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the impact of peri-operative bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> including anastomotic leakage on disease-free survival of stage I/II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective follow up data of 448 patients with stages I/II <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> that underwent resection were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who died within 3 months after initial surgery were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow up was 56.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with peri-operative bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (n = 25) had a higher recurrence rate compared to patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (n = 423), 36.0 % vs. 16.1 % (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival was significantly worse for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> group compared to patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis including T-stage, histological grade, and adjuvant chemotherapy showed peri-operative bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> to be an independent factor significantly associated with disease recurrence (odds ratio, 2.7; 95 % CI, 1.1-6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Peri-operative bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> is associated with increased recurrence rates and impaired disease-free survival in early-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
