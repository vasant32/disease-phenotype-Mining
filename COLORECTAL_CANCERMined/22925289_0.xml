<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, given the possibility of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence, surveillance colonoscopy is currently recommended after the initial screening and removal of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_557'>Aberrant crypt foci</z:mpath> (ACF) have been shown to serve as a reliable surrogate marker of colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the relationship between the number of ACF at the initial endoscopic polypectomy and the likelihood of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence after polypectomy were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-magnification chromoscopic colonoscopy was performed in 82 subjects who underwent endoscopic polypectomy to identify ACF in the lower rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surveillance colonoscopy was then performed 3 years after the baseline polypectomy at Yokohama City University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of ACF was greater in patients who showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence (7.88 ± 6.35) than in those who did not (2.19 ± 2.95) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver-operating curve analysis showed that the number of ACF was a highly specific predictor of the risk of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study conducted to investigate the relationship between the number of ACF after endoscopic polypectomy and the likelihood of recurrence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the number of ACF is a useful predictor of the likelihood of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> recurrence </plain></SENT>
