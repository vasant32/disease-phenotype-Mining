<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median survival time after the pulmonary resections was 34.5 months; the overall survival of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 90.9%, 45.4% and 4.5%, and the overall of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate in non-operated group were 59.6%, 14.0% and 0 </plain></SENT>
