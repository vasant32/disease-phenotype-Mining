<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined postoperative serum DNA, obtained within one month after surgery from 38 out of the 39 patients and found that TFPI2 was methylated in the serum DNA of only 18 (47%) of these patients, suggesting that TFPI2 methylation in the serum of the remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients was abolished by surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the correlation between the presence of TFPI2 methylation in postoperative serum DNA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e> status after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If R0 (no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e>) operations were successfully performed, TFPI2 methylation was not detected in postoperative serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, if R2 (obvious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual cancer</z:e>) operations were performed, 17 (77%) out of 22 postoperative sera, still exhibited TFPI2 methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results confirm that detection of methylated TFPI2 in serum DNA was derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and could serve as a marker of surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
