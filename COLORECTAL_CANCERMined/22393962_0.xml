<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: A case control study was designed and to investigate the genotype frequencies of P53Arg72Pro polymorphism in Malaysian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and healthy controls and to determine the associated risk of this polymorphism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this case-control study, peripheral blood samples of 202 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and 201 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were collected, DNA extracted and genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype analysis showed the frequency of homozygous variant (Pro/Pro) genotype (21%) to be significantly higher in cases compared to controls (13%), (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On examining the association between variant genotypes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, the Pro/Pro homozygous variant genotype showed significantly higher risk association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility (OR: 2.047, CI: 1.063-4.044, p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When stratified according to age, we observed that, individuals aged above 50 years and carriers of pro/pro genotype had significantly higher risk with OR: 3.642, CI: 1.166-11.378, p=0.026 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the codon 72 SNP which results in amino acid substitution of Arginine to Proline in cell cycle regulatory gene P53, is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and carriers of Pro/Pro genotype and more than 50 years old may have high susceptibility </plain></SENT>
