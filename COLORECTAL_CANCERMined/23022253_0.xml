<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2009, a 3-part transfusion reduction initiative (TRI) was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was that this would decrease transfusions without increasing complications in patients undergoing elective resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After institutional review board approval was obtained, the medical records of patients who underwent colon resection before (January 2006 to October 2009) and after (November 2009 to March 2011) the TRI were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients were included, 272 and 96 in the pre-TRI and post-TRI groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion rates decreased in the post-TRI group compared with the pre-TRI group (15% vs 28%, P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median postoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels among transfused patients were 8.4 and 7.3 g/dL in the pre-TRI and post-TRI groups, respectively (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in complications or 30-day mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transfused patients with stages I to III <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> had worse 4-year survival (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative transfusions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery decreased after the implementation of a TRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complication rates did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perioperative transfusions were associated with worse survival in patients with stages I to III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
