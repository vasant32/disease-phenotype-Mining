<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main treatment modalities for single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220650" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">brain metastases</z:e> are whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current guidelines recommend complete surgical excision for single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555278" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral metastases</z:e> and two randomised controlled trials (RCT) have also found survival benefit of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a more recent RCT and a Cochrane review have challenged the effectiveness of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555278" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aims to assess the effectiveness of surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555278" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral metastases</z:e> in current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review was performed for a single surgeon series of consecutive patients undergoing primary surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555278" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral metastases</z:e> between June 2005 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the survival time after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty three patients (61 males, 62 females) were identified with a mean age of 58.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eighty three patients (67%) were under 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall 30-day mortality rate was 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall median survival was 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 26 (21%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> with median survival of 13.5 months, 32 (26%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> with 8.3 months, 24 (19%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanomas</z:hpo> with 6.7 months, 13 (11%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> with 6.4 months, and 11 (9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007134" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">renal cell cancers</z:e> with 13.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> group was compared to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NSCLC</z:e> group, the difference was significant (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median survival differences were not significant (p &gt; 0.05) with regard to the RPA class, the site (supratentorial or infratentorial) and the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> (single or two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Median survival in this cohort was identical to those in the two RCTs that showed survival benefits from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This was significantly longer than that (5.6 months) in the single series demonstrating no benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results support the previous evidence of improved outcomes with surgery </plain></SENT>
