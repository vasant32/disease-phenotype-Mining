<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 265 patients with operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> before the initiation of adjuvant systemic therapy from 96 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> prepared from the Lovo and ARH-77 CRC and leukemic cell lines, respectively, was used as positive and negative controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detection of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was done using a real-time PCR assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association with known prognostic factors and the effect of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells on patients' prognosis was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analytical detection limit of the method was found to correspond to 0.7 Lovo cell equivalence/5 Î¼g <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, with a sensitivity of 1 tumor cell/10(5) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells and a specificity of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight (37%) patients had detectable circulating CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was significantly associated with higher relapse rate (P &lt; 0.001), decreased disease-free survival (DFS; P &lt; 0.001), higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (P = 0.017), and decreased median overall survival (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that the detection of circulating CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells was an independent prognostic factor for decreased DFS [HR = 3.4; 95% CI: 2.0-5.9; P &lt; 0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Detection of peripheral blood CEACAM5mRNA-positive cells is an adverse prognostic factor correlated with poor clinical outcome in patients with operable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
