<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>SCOPE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">Curcumin</z:chebi> is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26195">polyphenol</z:chebi> with a variety of pharmacologic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the effect of dietary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> on the severity of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two dietary groups: standard diet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> at 0.6% diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mice were exposed to 15 cycles of 0.7% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="32149">sodium sulphate</z:chebi> for 1 week followed by distilled water for 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> diet, the disease activity index presented a statistical reduction in the last cycles, macroscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were not seen and the microscopic study showed minor neoplasic lesions with respect to standard diet-group. β-Catenin translocation to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus was observed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue, but this translocation and its intensity were significantly minor in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> diet-DSS animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokines as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α and IFN-γ were significantly diminished in DSS-animals fed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, non-modification of p53 expression was observed and cyclo-oxygenase-2 and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase were significantly reduced in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> diet-DSS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the protective/preventive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3962">curcumin</z:chebi> in the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, which was correlated with a lowered immunoreactivity of ß-catenin, a non-modification of p53 expression, a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine levels and a decrease of inflammatory protein overexpression </plain></SENT>
