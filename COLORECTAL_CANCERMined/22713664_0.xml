<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a two-site comparison of two commercial KRAS mutation kits - the cobas KRAS Mutation Test and the Qiagen therascreen KRAS Kit - and Sanger sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A panel of 120 CRC specimens was tested with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The agreement between the cobas test and each of the other methods was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens with discordant results were subjected to quantitative massively parallel pyrosequencing (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA blends were tested to determine detection rates at 5% mutant alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reproducibility of the cobas test between sites was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six mutations were detected by cobas that were not detected by Sanger, and five were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cobas test detected eight mutations which were not detected by the therascreen test, and seven were confirmed by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="34761">MPP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Detection rates with 5% mutant DNA blends were 100% for the cobas and therascreen tests and 19% for Sanger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cobas test was reproducible between sites, and detected several mutations that were not detected by the therascreen test or Sanger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sanger sequencing had poor sensitivity for low levels of mutation </plain></SENT>
