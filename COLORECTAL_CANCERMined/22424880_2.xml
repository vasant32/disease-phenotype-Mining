<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab prolongs overall and progression-free survival when added to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, gastrointestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (GIP) occurs in 1-2% of treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to describe the incidence, temporal pattern, outcomes and potential risk factors for GIP in a large, community-based observational cohort study of patients treated with bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics, including potential GIP risk factors, were collected at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment, targeted adverse events, progression events and survival data were recorded every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed clinical information was collected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients experiencing a GIP event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Effects of baseline risk factors on GIP risk were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1953 evaluable patients followed for a median of 20.1 months, 37 (1.9%) experienced GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most GIP events were surgically managed with successful outcomes; four events were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of GIP events (26/37) occurred ≤6 months after starting bevacizumab (median, 3.35 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that age ≥65 years was significantly associated with lower GIP risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, intact <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumour</z:e> and prior adjuvant radiotherapy were significantly associated with increased risk of GIP within 6 months after starting bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A regression analysis that assessed the risk of GIP over time showed no cumulative risk associated with bevacizumab exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The observed rate of GIP in this large, community-based experience was consistent with rates reported in RCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most events were successfully managed with surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
