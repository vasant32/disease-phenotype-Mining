<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Worldwide, prices for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs have been under downward pressure where several governments have mandated price cuts of branded products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A better alternative to government mandated price cuts would be to estimate a final price based on drug performance, cost effectiveness and a country's ability to pay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a global pricing index for new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) that encompasses <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these attributes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model was developed to simulate mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy plus a 'new drug' that improves survival by 1.4, 3 and 6months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cost and utility data were obtained from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> centres and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> nurses (n=112) in Canada, Spain, India, South Africa and Malaysia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis was then used to develop the pricing index, which considers survival benefit, per capita GDP and income dispersion (as measured by the Gini coefficient) as predictor variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher survival benefits were associated with elevated drug prices, especially in higher income countries such as Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For Argentina with a per capita GDP of $15,000 and a Gini coefficient of 51, the index estimated that for a drug which provides a 4month survival benefit in mCRC, the value based price would be $US 630 per dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the same drug in a wealthier country like Norway (per capita GDP=$50,000) could command a price of $US 2,775 per dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The application of this index to estimate a price based on cost effectiveness and the wealth of a nation would be important for opening dialogue between the key stakeholders and a better alternative to government mandated price cuts </plain></SENT>
