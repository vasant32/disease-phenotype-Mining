<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of the complexes towards the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17172">2'-deoxyguanosine</z:chebi> 5'-monophosphate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17256">2'-deoxyadenosine</z:chebi> 5'-monophosphate was studied using capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity were measured in an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-sensitive and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-resistant ileocecal colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell line pair (HCT-8/HCT-8ox) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">Platinum</z:chebi> concentrations were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assay was used to assess cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early cellular <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> accumulation was predominantly affected by lipophilicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A relationship between reactivity and cellular accumulation was observed for three of four <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> complexes investigated, whereas the most lipophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> analogue was an exception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased reactivity and reduced lipophilicity were associated with high cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resistance was influenced by lipophilicity but not by reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observed relationships may help in the design of analogues with high antitumoral activity in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-sensitive as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
