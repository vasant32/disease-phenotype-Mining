<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> (mCRC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses </plain></SENT>
