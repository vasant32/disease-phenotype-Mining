<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate our experience of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> in patients with resected colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> who had concomitant or recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and treatment variables of patients undergoing RFA were collected, and their association with survival was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RFA was performed as concomitant sequential treatment of extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> after hepatectomy in 19 patients (30%) and as salvage treatment for pulmonary recurrences after hepatectomy in 45 patients (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing sequential treatment had a median survival of 31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.8-40.6) months compared to 59 (95% CI 35.0-82.0) months in the salvage treatment group (P = 0.142) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 (95% CI 1.0-18.8) months in the sequential treatment group and 16 (95% CI 8.1-23.1) months in the salvage treatment group (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver metastases</z:e> occurring within 12 months of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> negatively influenced overall survival (OS) and DFS in the sequential treatment group (P = 0.003 and P = 0.091) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poorly differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (P = 0.001) was associated with a poorer OS, and prehepatectomy carcinoembryonic antigen &gt; 200 ng/ml (P = 0.017) and bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> (P = 0.030) were associated with a shorter DFS in the salvage treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DFS and OS of patients undergoing sequential RFA of extrahepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> after hepatectomy appeared shorter when compared to patients who underwent RFA as salvage treatment for pulmonary recurrences after hepatectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It nonetheless remains better than the historical results of chemotherapy alone and thus supports the use of RFA as an ablative technology to achieve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
