<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of these two agents was associated with clinical activity in 5-FU refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients in a phase I clinical trial, therefore warranting the conduct of this prospective phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were randomized in a two-stage design to receive vorinostat at 800 or 1,400 mg/day once a day Ã— 3, every 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>5-FU, preceded by leucovorin, was administered as a bolus followed by a 46-h infusion on days 2 and 3 of vorinostat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A pre-specified 2-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 27/43 patients per arm was needed to deem an arm interesting for further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The high-dose vorinostat arm did not reach the needed efficacy endpoint at completion of the first stage, with only 8 out of 15 patients being alive and progression free at 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The low-dose vorinostat arm proceeded to accrue 43 patients with a 2-month PFS rate of 53% (23 out 43), including one partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median PFS and overall survival on the low-dose arm were 2.4 and 6.5 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both treatment arms were well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No differences were noted in the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat at the 800- or 1,400-mg dose-levels, suggesting bioavailability saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: While the addition of vorinostat to 5-FU resulted in 1 partial response and in some disease stabilizations, the limited activity does not warrant the unselected use of this combination in chemotherapy-refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
