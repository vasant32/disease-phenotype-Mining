<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The principal aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a large-scale comparative study, between the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden, to investigate whether delays in the diagnostic pathway of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> might explain differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival between countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following a planning meeting to agree the format of a data collection instrument, data on delays in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnostic pathway were abstracted from primary care-held medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on 50 cases each (total of 150) from practices in each of Grampian, Northeast Scotland; Maastricht, the Netherlands and Skane, Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were entered into SPSS 18.0 for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data on delays in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnostic pathway were readily available from primary care-held case records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, data on demographic variables, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage at diagnosis and treatment were less well recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between countries in the way in which cases were referred from primary to secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between countries in the time delay between a patient presenting in primary care and being referred to secondary care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median delay between referral and first appointment in secondary care [19 (8.0-47.5) days] was significantly longer in Scotland that in Sweden [1.0 (0-31.5) days] and the Netherlands [5.5 (0-31.5) days] (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary care delay (between first appointment in secondary care and diagnosis) in Scotland [22.5 (0-39.5) days] was also significantly longer than in Sweden [14.0 (4.5-31.5) days] and the Netherlands [3.5 (0-16.5) days] (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, overall delay in Scotland [53.5 (30.3-96.3) days] was also significantly longer than in Sweden [32.0 (14.0-71.0) days] and the Netherlands [22.0 (7.0-60.3) days] (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A large-scale study comparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> delays in European countries and based on primary care-held records is feasible but would require supplementary sources of data in order to maximize information on demographic variables, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage at diagnosis and treatment details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such a large-scale study is timely and desirable since our findings suggest systematic differences in the way <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> is managed in the three countries </plain></SENT>
