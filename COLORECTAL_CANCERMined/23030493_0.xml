<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the overall clinical response to such a therapy in clinical practice and assess the role of KRAS status on therapy response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS &amp; METHODS: This was a retrospective study enrolling 108 metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutation analysis was performed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 41.7% of patients had stable disease, 39.8% a partial response, 3.7% a complete response and 14.8% disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both clinical benefit and objective response rate tended to be higher in patients with only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastases</z:e> than those with extrahepatic or multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy would appear to be independent of KRAS status, but larger studies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy provides clinical benefit and objective response rate in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> independently of KRAS expression, especially in those patients with only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
