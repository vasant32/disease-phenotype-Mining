<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the effect of risk assessment on patient management, with particular emphasis on referral for clinical screening and selection of families for tertiary genetics assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of concordance between the initial risk assignment (using diagnoses reported by the family) and final risk assignment (using confirmed diagnoses) was no greater than 72.3 % in 1,363 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> families; a similar effect was seen in 764 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> families (77.3 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically important risk reassignment occurred at the three key stages in the risk assessment pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, genetic risk was reassigned in almost 30 % of colorectal families and 20 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> families, resulting in a change in screening recommendation and/or referral for tertiary genetic assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Careful, detailed family history assessment, with confirmation of reported diagnoses where it may affect risk assignment, is an important process for the point of view of patient management and resource allocation </plain></SENT>
