<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early endoscopic detection and removal of its precursor lesions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, and serrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_140'>hyperplastic polyps</z:mpath> results in a decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, miss rates in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection up to 26% underline the need for high compliance to basic measures and further improvement in methodology and technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basic parameters affecting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rates include sufficient training and awareness of the endoscopist, use of high-definition endoscopes, careful examination behind folds, cleansing the colon wall, accurate distention of the colon, and adequate withdrawal time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advanced imaging techniques, introduced to further improve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection, have yielded mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These include wide-angle colonoscopes, cap-assisted colonoscopy, and retroscopic methods which may add new obstacles to colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, chromoendoscopy either 'virtual' or by topically applied dyes has been suggested to enhance the detection of colonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Yet, studies on patients with average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk have failed to reproduce promising initial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, although autofluorescence has not enhanced the diagnostic yield in screening a population at average risk, it may be useful in patients at increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, technical feasibility of molecular imaging employing 'biomarkers' has been demonstrated, but needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The newest developments, employing light-scattering spectroscopy, suggest the existence of a 'field effect' of colonic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> and may enable detection of the earliest neoplastic events and distant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> even when applied to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upon confirmation, these technologies may result in a substantial change in patient management and risk stratification </plain></SENT>
