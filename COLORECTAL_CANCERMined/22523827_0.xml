<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specialized centers have demonstrated good results with simultaneous resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to report our outcomes at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) with simultaneous liver metastasectomy at the time of operation for primary colorectal or gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> STUDY DESIGN: From January 2010- September 2011, 6 patients underwent simultaneous resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> and primary colorectal or gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operative, postoperative, and pathologic data were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients with colorectal primaries underwent simultaneous resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One received abdominoperineal resection with resection of lesions in hepatic segments II and VII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second received right hemicolectomy with en bloc resection of gallbladder and segments IV and V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third and fourth patients both underwent left colectomy with resection of segments IV and V, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> resections were non-anatomic, and frozen-sections were confirmed to be negative at the resection base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients suffered additional postoperative morbidity or mortality related to liver resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> to the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first underwent en bloc resection ofgallbladder and segments IV and V along with extensive debulking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The second had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278689" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent ovarian cancer</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> with liver segments VI and VII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent simultaneous resection with no added postoperative morbidity or mortality attributed to hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, the objective is to remove bulky disease, and although microscopic margins were positive, the goal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> load reduction was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection at the time of operation for primary colorectal or gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> can safely be performed with the benefit of avoiding morbidity of a second laparotomy without compromising safety </plain></SENT>
