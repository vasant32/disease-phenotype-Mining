<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the compounds being active cytotoxic agents, four of them with minimal IC₅₀ values were chosen and studied in detail with MCF-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The compounds 1, 5, 23, and 25 were capable in eliciting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MCF-7 cells as shown by multiparameter cytotoxicity assay and caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 activities (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ROS level showed 1.3-fold increase (p &lt; 0.05) at the low concentrations used and thus it was concluded that the compounds increased the ROS level eventually leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in MCF-7 cells through intrinsic as well as extrinsic pathways </plain></SENT>
