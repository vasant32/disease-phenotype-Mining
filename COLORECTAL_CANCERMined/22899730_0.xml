<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: BRAF mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) are disproportionately observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI) and are associated with other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The independent association between BRAF mutation status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival, however, remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the association between the BRAF c.1799T&gt;A (p.V600E) mutation and survival in individuals with incident invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 in Western Washington State </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> specimens were tested for this BRAF mutation and MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used Cox regression to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between BRAF mutation status and disease-specific and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses were conducted by age, sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, stage, and MSI status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1,980 cases tested, 12% were BRAF c.1799T&gt;A (p.V600E) mutation-positive (n = 247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BRAF-mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was associated with poorer disease-specific survival adjusting for age, sex, time from diagnosis to enrollment, stage, and MSI status (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This association was limited to cases diagnosed at ages &lt;50 (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.70-5.52) and was not evident in cases with MSI-high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.44-2.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations with overall survival were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the prevalence of BRAF mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> differs by patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and suggest that the association between BRAF status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survival may differ by some of these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: The presence of a BRAF c.1799T&gt;A (p.V600E) mutation is associated with significantly poorer prognosis after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosis among subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
