<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A therapeutic strategy being explored takes advantage of checkpoint defects in p53-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in order to sensitize them to DNA-damaging agents by eliminating Chk1-mediated checkpoint responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using mouse models, we demonstrated that p21 is a key determinant of how cells respond to the combination of DNA damage and Chk1 inhibition (combination therapy) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Loss of p21 sensitized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells to the combination therapy much more than did p53 loss and the enhanced <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was partially blocked by CDK inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, basal pools of p21 (p53 independent) provided p53 null cells with protection from the combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results uncover a novel p53-independent function for p21 in protecting cells from the lethal effects of DNA damage followed by Chk1 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As p21 levels are low in a significant fraction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e>, they are predicted to be particularly sensitive to the combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results reported in this study support this prediction </plain></SENT>
