<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred consecutive Spanish individuals over 50 years of age completed a questionnaire to determine their screening intentions, previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnostic procedures, and knowledge about screening procedures, risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, 5-year prognosis, warning signs and symptoms, incidence, age-related risk and perceived barriers to screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although 78.8% of subjects reported that they were willing to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, only 12% had ever undergone a screening test, and none with screening intention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Awareness of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> screening test [odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.70; P = 0.035], visiting a general practitioner in the preceding year (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.86-5.08; P &lt; 0.0001), awareness of risk factors (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.49-3.61; P &lt; 0.001), awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> signs or symptoms (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.64; P = 0.04) and belief in the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (OR 8.85, 95% CI 1.53-51.3; P = 0.01) were independent predictors for intention to participate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common reasons given for refusing screening were '<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests might be dangerous' (28.2%), '<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests might be painful' (17.9%) and 'feeling healthy' (16.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although reported willingness to undergo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was high, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge and actual uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening were low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An educational intervention to reduce barriers and increase awareness could improve uptake of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
