<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the accuracy of preoperative imaging for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> degenerated by chemotherapy is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who had received adjuvant chemotherapy and undergone hepatectomy were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The whole resected liver was sliced at approximately 1mm intervals and the slices were examined carefully for gross lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative CT and EOB-MRI findings of each lesion were compared with gross and histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The accuracy of EOB-MRI was higher than that of CT for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of lesions detected on EOB-MRI was in agreement with that of histopathologically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> in 4 of the 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions that were grossly identified but turned out to be non-neoplastic were regenerative nodules associated with drug-induced liver injury or lobular nodules associated with marked fatty change, measuring about 1mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EOB-MRI was the most accurate method for the preoperative detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, enabling the visualization of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
