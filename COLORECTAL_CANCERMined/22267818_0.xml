<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A written survey was distributed to clinicians and staff at 15 primary care practices to determine whether they perceived that personnel in their practices performed a series of 4 steps associated with screening colonoscopy and 7 steps associated with stool blood test screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each discrete step, the percentage of respondents from each practice who indicated that a given step is performed in that practice was calculated along with the mean of practice percentages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survey results indicate wide variation in the degree to which these screening steps are performed across the 15 practices. â€ŠVariation was greater for steps that involved contacting nonresponders (reminders), scheduling, and rescheduling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survey responses suggest substantial variation and much room for improvement in practice performance of evidence-based steps in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening process </plain></SENT>
