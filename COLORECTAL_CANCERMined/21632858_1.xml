<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the expression of LDH5 (encoded entirely by the LDHA gene, regulated by the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> inducible factors) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues from patients recruited in the CONFIRM trials and relationship to response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Paraffin-embedded materials from 179 patients recruited in the CONFIRM trials were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the LDH5 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations with serum LDH, response, and survival were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and of poor performance status (PS) with serum LDH was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor PS and high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> LDH5 expression predicted for poor response rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High tissue LDH5 was related to poor progression-free survival (PFS) only in the placebo group of patients, whereas the addition of vatalanib seemed to improved response and PFS in this subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High serum LDH levels were linked with significantly poorer overall survival, which however was not sustained in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum LDH and tissue LDH5 levels are complementary features that help to characterize the activity of LDH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and have a potent value in predicting response to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of vatalanib diminished the impact of LDH expression on the prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
