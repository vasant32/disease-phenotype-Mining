<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study aims to optimize dosage and timing of ICG administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023903" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Liver tumors</z:e> were induced in 18 male WAG/Rij rats by subcapsular inoculation of CC531 rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells into three distinct liver lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided in two groups: imaging after 24 and 48 h or 72 and 96 h after intravenous ICG administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each time group, rats were allocated to three dose groups: 0.04, 0.08, or 0.16 mg ICG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative imaging and ex vivo measurements were performed using the Mini-FLARE imaging system and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence intensity was quantified using the Mini-FLARE software and the difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> signal and liver signal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-liver ratio; TLR) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 18 rats, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (n = 34), some as small as 1.2 mm, were identified using ICG and the Mini-FLARE imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-to-liver ratio (TLR) over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups was 3.0 Â± 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLR was significantly higher in the 72 h time group compared with other time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ICG dose did not significantly influence TLR, but a trend was found favoring the 0.08 mg dose group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated a clear fluorescent rim around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> can be clearly identified during surgery using ICG and the Mini-FLARE imaging system, with optimal timing of 72 h post-injection and an optimal dose of 0.08 mg (0.25 mg/kg) ICG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>NIR fluorescence imaging has the potential to improve intraoperative detection of micrometastases and, thus, the completeness of resection </plain></SENT>
