<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and paired adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues were obtained and differentially expressed protein spots were determined using PDQuest software, with identification on the basis of MALDI- TOF mass spectra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colorectal mucosa, protein abnormal expression of 65 spots varying more than 1.5 times were found in 2-DE gels from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> samples (P&lt;0.05); forty-two proteins were up-regulated and 23 were down-regulated; twelve protein spots were identified using mass spectrometry, of which 8 were up-regulated, including HSPB1 and Annexin A4, while 4 were down-regulated, the results being consistent with Western blot findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two-dimensional electrophoresis reference maps for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues and adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa (NMC) were established and 12 differentially expressed proteins were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up-regulated HSPB1 and Annexin A4 may play many important roles in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
