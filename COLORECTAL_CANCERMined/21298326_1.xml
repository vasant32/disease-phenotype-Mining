<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18388">apigenin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24043">a flavone</z:chebi> present in leafy vegetables like parsley, on the levels of CD26 in <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CD26 is a multifunctional cell-surface protein that through its associated dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV) and ecto-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (eADA) enzyme activities is able to suppress pathways involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumour metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD26 is down-regulated in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> including colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="18388">Apigenin</z:chebi> substantially up-regulated cell-surface CD26 on HT-29 and HRT-18 human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of CD26 protein, along with its associated DPPIV enzyme activity, capacity to bind eADA, and ability to link cells to fibronectin, were increased with a maximum after 24-48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevation of CD26 occurred at concentrations that were at least 10-fold less than those shown to affect cell growth, and 100-fold below those that could affect cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CD26 effect was enhanced when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18388">apigenin</z:chebi> was paired with chemotherapeutic agents utilized in the treatment of advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> including irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18388">apigenin</z:chebi> caused a 4-fold increase in the potency of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18388">apigenin</z:chebi> can increase the cellular levels of CD26 and its multiple functions, and may oppose the predicted effect of decreased DPPIV and eADA activities on <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, which is to facilitate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
