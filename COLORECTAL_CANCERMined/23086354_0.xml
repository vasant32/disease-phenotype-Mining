<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Elemental mapping and fluorescence imaging techniques are frequently employed to probe the distribution of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>-based chemotherapeutics within biological systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although useful, these techniques have unique limitations: elemental mapping methods, such as those that use particle beams, typically require rigorous sample preparation that can alter chemical distributions, whilst in situ visible fluorescence studies require fluorescent-tagging of the <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> component and may be confounded by factors such as ligand loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to establish reliable methods for accurately probing the bio-distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33749">platinum compounds</z:chebi> within the model <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> micro-environment of the well characterised DLD-1 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell spheroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3D X-ray fluorescence computed micro-tomography (XRF-CT) was performed on intact untreated spheroids to determine the effect of physical sectioning and chemical fixation on elemental distributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was revealed for the first time that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> can readily penetrate through DLD-1 spheroids and accumulate in the central hypoxic and necrotic regions of the spheroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, formalin fixing was shown to cause significant changes to the distributions and concentrations of the elements, particularly in the cases of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> and zinc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed in the cryo-fixed and cryo-sectioned samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) was used to re-examine the fate of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> in the previously reported fluorescence distribution studies of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>(ii) complexes tagged with fluorescent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22580">anthraquinone</z:chebi> moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the fluorescence distributions, in which fluorescence was observed predominantly around the periphery of the spheroids, the XFM revealed a high level of <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> in the spheroid centre, indicating that ligand exchange occurred within the peripheral cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> maps and the fluorescence images exhibit similar diffusion trends, supporting the conclusion that charge on the compound can slow cellular uptake can enhance <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> penetration </plain></SENT>
