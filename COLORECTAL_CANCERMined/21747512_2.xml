<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The capabilities of using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50825">gold nanoparticle</z:chebi> based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to obtain blood serum biochemical information for non-invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> detection were presented in this paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SERS measurements were performed on two groups of blood serum samples: one group from patients (n = 38) with pathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and the other group from healthy volunteers (control subjects, n = 45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tentative assignments of the Raman bands in the measured SERS spectra suggested interesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific biomolecular changes, including an increase in the relative amounts of nucleic acid, a decrease in the percentage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23008">saccharide</z:chebi> and proteins contents in the blood serum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients as compared to that of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both empirical approach and multivariate statistical techniques, including principal components analysis (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were employed to develop effective diagnostic algorithms for classification of SERS spectra between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The empirical diagnostic algorithm based on the ratio of the SERS peak intensity at 725 cm(-1) for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> to the peak intensity at 638 cm(-1) for tyrosine achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 68.4% and specificity of 95.6%, whereas the diagnostic algorithms based on <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-LDA yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 100% for separating cancerous samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves further confirmed the effectiveness of the diagnostic algorithm based on <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-LDA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from this exploratory study demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50825">gold nanoparticle</z:chebi> based SERS serum analysis combined with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-LDA has tremendous potential for the non-invasive detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
