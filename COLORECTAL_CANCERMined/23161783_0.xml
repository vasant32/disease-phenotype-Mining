<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vagal sensory axons have been shown to respond to the axon guidance molecule netrin and to its receptor, deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As there are regions of the gut wall into which vagal axons do and do not extend, it is likely that a combination of attractive and repellent cues are involved in how vagal axons reach specific targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that Slit/Robo chemorepulsion can contribute to the restriction of vagal sensory axons to specific targets in the gut wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transcripts encoding Robo1 and Robo2 were expressed in the nodose ganglia throughout development and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding the Robo ligands Slit1, Slit2, and Slit3 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found in the fetal and adult bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slit2 protein was located in the outer gut mesenchyme in regions that partially overlap with the secretion of netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurites extending from explanted nodose ganglia were repelled by Slit2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that vagal sensory axons are responsive to Slit proteins and are thus repelled by Slits secreted in the gut wall and prevented from reaching inappropriate targets </plain></SENT>
