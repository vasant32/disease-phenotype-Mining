<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to apply the theoretical model of strength and vulnerability integration (SAVI; Charles, 2010) to understand age-related patterns in emotional experiences and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> appraisals among people diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals recently diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (N = 139; 28-89 years-old) completed measures of positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms, and appraisals about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at four time points: baseline (prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery), 6-, 12-, and 18-months postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multilevel modeling examined changes in affective experience and appraisals over time, across age, and the interaction of time by age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Negative affect decreased more rapidly over time among older adults than younger adults, p &lt; .05, but positive affect was reasonably stable and unrelated to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depressive symptoms were also fairly stable over time, but consistently higher among younger adults, p &lt; .01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Older age was significantly related to lower threat appraisals and greater levels of challenge, p &lt; .01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Threat, but not challenge, mediated the age-by-time interaction predicting negative affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Older age was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms and negative affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older adults also reported more adaptive appraisals of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, which accounted for their more rapid decline in negative affect compared to younger adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, SAVI is a useful model for understanding age-related patterns in emotional well-being and appraisals in the context of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
