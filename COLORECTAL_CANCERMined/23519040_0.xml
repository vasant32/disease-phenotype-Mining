<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: We examined subgroups of Chinese American patients nonadherent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening guidelines to better inform clinical practices to effectively promote screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Using latent class analysis of data from 327 participants recruited from 18 primary care clinics, we classified nonadherent patients based on sociodemographics, screening barriers, and attitudinal and clinical factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The best-fitting latent class analysis model described 3 distinctive classes: Western healthcare class (36%), Eastern healthcare class (18%), and mixed healthcare class (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western healthcare class patients were highly educated, with average US residency of 20 years, a high level of English proficiency, the least Eastern cultural views of care, and the greatest exposure to physician recommendations, but reported having no time for screenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eastern healthcare class patients were highly educated seniors and recent immigrants with the least <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge and the most Eastern cultural views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mixed healthcare class patients had low level of education, resided in the United States for 20 years, and half had sought services of their physicians for at least 3 years, but their knowledge and cultural views were similar to those of Eastern healthcare class patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: Nonadherent Chinese American patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is essential to have future intervention programs tailored to address specific screening beliefs and barriers for subtypes of nonadherent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Training primary care physicians to recognize patients' different demographic characteristics and healthcare beliefs may facilitate physicians' communication with patients to overcome their barriers and improve screening behaviors </plain></SENT>
