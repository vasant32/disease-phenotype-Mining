<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: general and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> mortality rates were obtained from the National Statistics Institute and survival data was obtained from the EUROCARE study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimations were carried out through the program MIAMOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The joinpoint program was used to quantify the annual change expected in the projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: in men, an increase in prevalence is expected, from 237.2 (Crude Rate - CR = 303.5) to 237.7 (CR = 412.7) per 100.000 inhabitants/year in 2022 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates would increase from 48.2 (CR = 61.6) in 2007 to 55.2 (CR = 83.1), and mortality would increase from 22.7 (CR = 29.4) to 26.0 (CR = 39.6) when comparing 2007 and women, a reduction in prevalence is expected from 181.5 (CR = 268.3) to 167.9 (CR = 286.2) cases per 100,000 inhabitants/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence would change from 25.0 (CR = 38.0) in 2007 to 22.7 (CR = 39.2), and for mortality there is also an expected decrease, from 11.3 (CR =18.0) to 10.3 (CR = 18.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the projections indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in follows an increasing trend in incidence, mortality and prevalencein men, in opposition to corresponding decreasing trends in women.These projections must be considered in order to plan more effective prevention and treatment measures </plain></SENT>
