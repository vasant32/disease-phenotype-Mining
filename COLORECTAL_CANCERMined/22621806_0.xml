<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> subsequent to surgery are based mainly on the TNM system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a need to establish novel prognostic markers based on the molecular characterization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence exists that sialyl Le(X) expression is correlated with an unfavorable outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish a simple sialyl Le(X) staining score and to determine a potential correlation with the prognosis in a series of advanced colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to implement routine use of sialyl Le(X) immunohistology, we established a new, easily reproducible score and defined a cutoff which discriminated groups with better or worse outcome, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then correlated sialyl Le(X) expression of 215 UICC stage III and IV patients with disease-free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A five-stage score could be established based on automated immunohistochemical stainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a statistical model, we calculated a cutoff to discriminate between weak and strong staining positivity of sialyl Le(X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with strong positive specimens had a worse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related survival (P = 0.004) but no difference was observed for disease-free survival (P = 0.352) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a strong correlation between high sialyl Le(X)-expression in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our highly standardized and easy-to-use staining score is suitable for routine use and hence it could be recommended to evaluate sialyl Le(X)-expression as part of the standard histopathological analysis of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and to validate the score prospectively based on a larger population </plain></SENT>
