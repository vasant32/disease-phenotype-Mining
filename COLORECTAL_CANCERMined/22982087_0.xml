<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) have been implicated in the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> based therapy is a current interest for drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent cell culture studies have suggested that in the absence of a TP53 mutation, OIS mediated by PI3K/AKT activation can be circumvented by high expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while PI3K/AKT activation and KRAS mutations are independent inducers of OIS, PI3K/AKT activation can suppress KRAS-induced OIS when both are present in cultured cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As KRAS mutations, PI3K/AKT activation and TP53 mutations are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, it is possible that the requirement for <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> to inhibit OIS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is dependent on the mutation spectrum of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, work on <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> that utilised mutation profiled human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> tissues has been limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterised the expression of two major <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> proteins (HSP27 and 72) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), the mutation status of TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA genes by direct sequencing and the activation status of AKT by IHC in a cohort of unselected primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (n=74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compare our data with findings generated from cell-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of HSP27 and HSP72 was correlated to clinicopathological and survival data but no significant association was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also established the mutation status of TP53, KRAS and PIK3CA genes and the activation status of AKT in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any associations between HSP27 or HSP72 expression with TP53 mutation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, HSP27 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> was strongly associated with the co-presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> KRAS and activated PI3K/AKT (p=0.004), indicating a possible role of HSP27 in overcoming PI3K/AKT induced OIS in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
