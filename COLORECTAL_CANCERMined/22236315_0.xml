<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether driving time or driving distance is a better indicator of travel burden is also of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Driving distances and times from patient residence to primary care provider were calculated for 3,917 breast, colorectal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> Medicaid patients in Washington State from 1997 to 2003 using MapQuest.com </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Later stage at diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> Medicaid patients is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> diagnosis and treatment than driving distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More intensive efforts at early detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and early treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed </plain></SENT>
