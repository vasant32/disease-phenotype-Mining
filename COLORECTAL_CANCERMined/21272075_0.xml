<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether or not there was an increased incidence of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients compared with an average-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 360 patients with solid organ transplants who underwent colonoscopy between February 1995 and July 2008, and 360 age- and gender-matched patients in an average-risk population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration from transplantation to colonoscopy in the SOT group was 40.4 Â± 34.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three (25.8%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in the SOT group, while 98 (27.2%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were detected in the control group (p = 0.763) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001) in the number of patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in the SOT group (24 patients [6.7%]) compared with the control group (3 patients [0.8%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The independent risk factors of advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were old age (odds ratio [OR], 1.067; 95% CI, 1.019-1.118) and transplantation (OR, 6.069; 95% CI, 1.455-25.314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, there was a significant increase in the incidence of advanced colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in SOT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reason for this finding is unclear, and studies with a larger number of patients are needed to further evaluate this group </plain></SENT>
