<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG(2) antibody targeting the EGF receptor (EGFR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This agent represents a new class of drug owing to its fully human nature, and no need for premedication and loading dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Panitumumab selectively binds to EGFR, blocking the extracellular domain of the receptor, and has not been associated with the formation of any antibodies directed against it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with non-mutated (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>- and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The safety profile is favorable and is generally well tolerated; the most common toxicities are skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, panitumumab's hypersensitivity reaction rate is lower when compared with a chimeric monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Panitumumab increases the clinician's repertoire of agents to treat metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The available clinical data are the most promising for a single-agent anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in this disease at the present time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These new data open different clinical scenarios in metastatic colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients and encourage clinicians and basic researchers to investigate new therapeutic approaches for this patient subset </plain></SENT>
