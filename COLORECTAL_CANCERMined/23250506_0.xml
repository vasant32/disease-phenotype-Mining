<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into three prognostic groups based on significant differences in median overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is conducted to validate this classification in an external validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 193 patients of an external validation cohort who received irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy after first-line <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab at three institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of the five predefined factors (poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, LDH ≥400 IU/L, progression-free survival of first-line therapy &lt;6 months) remained highly significant in the validation cohort, although two (performance status 2 and peritoneal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>) were associated with borderline significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the three prognostic groups (low risk = no factors, intermediate risk = 1 factor, high risk = 2 or more factors) was low risk (n = 68; 35 %), intermediate risk (n = 80; 41 %), and high risk (n = 45; 23 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median OS of each group were 19.8, 11.0, and 7.9 months, respectively, with significant differences between groups, as found in the previous cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The previous prognostic classification of patients with MCRC who received irinotecan-based second-line chemotherapy was validated in another independent cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Validation in prospective studies is warranted </plain></SENT>
