<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Curcuminoids are derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has shown anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> activity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induction in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This aims to study the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Poloxamer</z:chebi> 407 as the thermogelling and mucoadhesive polymer for development of a site-targeting delivery system to enhance the localized delivery of curcuminoids to the colorectal cells for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mucoadhesive strength and rheological properties were measured as a function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">poloxamer</z:chebi> loaded with curcuminoids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The gelation temperature of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Poloxamer</z:chebi> 407 was found to vary with its concentration and start gelling at 37Â°C at the concentration of 15.5% (w/v) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To ensure gelation at physiological temperature after intra-rectal application, gelation temperature was determined by rheological measurement as well as by its physical appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that its mucoadhesive strength also shows a dependency on temperature, which appears to be related to the increment in the maximum strength and average strength of the polymer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results have suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53514">Poloxamer</z:chebi> 407 could be a potential thermogelling and mucoadhesive polymer for the development of a site-targeting colorectal drug delivery system for curcuminoids in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
