<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten-year simulation modeling was used to assess a virtual asymptomatic, average-risk population 50-74 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Negative OC was repeated 10 years later, and OC positive for advanced or non-advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> 3 or 5 years later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FOBT was repeated biennially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Negative CTC was repeated 5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive CTC and FOBT led to triennial OC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total cost and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> rate after 10 years for each screening strategy and 0-100% adherence rates with 10% increments were computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transition probabilities were programmed using distribution ranges to account for uncertainty parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct medical costs were estimated using the French national health insurance prices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic sensitivity analyses used 5000 Monte Carlo simulations generating model outcomes and standard deviations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For a given adherence rate, CTC screening was always the most effective but not the most cost-effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FOBT was the least effective but most cost-effective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OC was of intermediate efficacy and the least cost-effective strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Without screening, treatment of 123 CRC per 10,000 individuals would cost €3,444,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For 60% adherence, the respective costs of preventing and treating, respectively 49 and 74 FOBT-detected, 73 and 50 CTC-detected and 63 and 60 OC-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would be €2,810,000, €6,450,000 and €9,340,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Simulation modeling helped to identify what would be the most effective (CTC) and cost-effective screening (FOBT) strategy in the setting of mass <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening in France </plain></SENT>
