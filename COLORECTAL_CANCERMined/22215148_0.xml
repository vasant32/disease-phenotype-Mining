<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results from published studies on the association of NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism with the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the possible association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eligible published studies were searched from PubMed and Elsevier ScienceDirect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed for additive, dominant, and recessive models to assess the association using fixed- or random-effect model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 12 case-control studies that include 5,525 cases and 6,272 controls for the present meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant associations between NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were observed in additive (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16, p = 0.009) and dominant models (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.21, p = 0.004 for TT + CT vs. CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Caucasians but not in Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provided evidence that NQO1 rs1800566 genetic polymorphism was associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and that the T allele probably acts as an important risk factor </plain></SENT>
