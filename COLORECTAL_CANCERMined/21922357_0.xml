<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 127 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients who underwent curative surgery were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were assayed, and radiological examinations were performed routinely for 5 years after surgery or until recurrence was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Yearly recurrence rates (number of recurrences/number of patients assessed in a given year), sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-test probabilities were calculated from these values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrences tended to show almost the same frequencies in the first and second year after surgery (20 of 127 patients and 18 of 107 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the post-test probability of recurrence in patients with positive and negative serum CEA levels was significantly lower in the second year than in the first year (test positive: 40.0% and 76.0%; test negative: 9.3% and 0.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measuring CEA can help to identify patients likely to demonstrate recurrence with high accuracy only within the first year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another examination, such as imaging, is therefore necessary for monitoring patients at 2 or more years after surgery </plain></SENT>
