<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Girdin is crucial for cellular motility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cell lines and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expression has been demonstrated in a range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> by a few studies and was a prognostic factor in a subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of Girdin expression to clinicopathologic factors in terms of the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of immunohistochemical and clinicopathologic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital/referral center in South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Tissue microarrays were made from surgical biopsies of 298 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> diagnosed between November 1996 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were included in the study if their survival time was known and if well-preserved surgical biopsy specimens were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were Girdin expression and its association in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive staining for Girdin was observed in samples from 66 of 242 patients (27.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of Girdin was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-node-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> stage (p = 0.036), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> (p = 0.025), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> involving the liver and other organs (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, Girdin expression did not correlate significantly with the overall survival of patients and was not a significant negative prognostic factor for survival by univariate or multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The number of investigated patients and the number of cases with positive staining for Girdin were rather small for the multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inclusion time frame is long and includes other surgical and medical improvements, which influence a patient's survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of Girdin is related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">tumor metastasis</z:e> but not to survival in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
