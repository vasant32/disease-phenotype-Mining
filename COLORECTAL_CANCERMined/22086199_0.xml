<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The optimal surgical strategy for patients presenting with colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short- and long-term outcomes must be considered if simultaneous resection of primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> is to gain acceptance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examine the prognostic value of patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics in predicting short- and long-term outcomes following simultaneous resection for synchronous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients undergoing simultaneous resection between April 2002 and June 2010 in a single institution were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics included preoperative <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade and POSSUM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> characteristics included TNM stage, Petersen Index and the Clinical Risk Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (seven patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean hospital stay with an uncomplicated postoperative recovery was 11 days versus 17 days with complicated recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age (p = 0.015), <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> grade (p = 0.010) and POSSUM score (p = 0.032) were associated with postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No pathological characteristics of the primary or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumours</z:e> related to surgical morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 37 months (5-87) during which 24 patients died, 23 from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven had disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>N stage of the primary (p = 0.035), high-risk Petersen Index of the primary (p = 0.010) and Clinical Risk Score ≥ 3 (p = 0.005) were associated with poorer recurrence-free and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Post operative morbidity was determined by patient factors rather than operative or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Clinical Risk Score, pathological characteristics of the primary are important determinants of long-term outcome following simultaneous resection for synchronous disease </plain></SENT>
