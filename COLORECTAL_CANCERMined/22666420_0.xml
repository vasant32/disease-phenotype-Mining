<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Association studies have identified low penetrance alleles that participate to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 8q24 chromosomal region contains several such loci involved in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> that have been recently studied for their propensity to influence the clinical outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated here two 8q24 breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> risk alleles in the close vicinity of the MYC gene for their role in the occurrence of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A retrospective series of 449 patients affected with breast or <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> was genotyped for the rs13281615 and/or rs6983267 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were done using the survival package v2.30 in the R software v2.9.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs did not influence the development of distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>; rs6983267 showed a mild effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this effect was greatly emphasized when considering inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (IBC) solely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Replicated on a larger and independent series of IBC the contribution of the genotype to the metastatic risk of IBC was found an independent predictor of outcome (p = 2e-4; OR 8.3, CI95:2.6-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows first that the monitoring of this specific germline variation may add a substantial tool for IBC prognostication, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> that evolves towards distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> much more frequently than non-IBC and for which no reliable prognostic factor is available in medical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Second, it more generally suggests that risk alleles, while associated with low susceptibility, could correlate with a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
