<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab is being used increasingly in the treatment of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, although data regarding its effect on post-embolization <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this observational study was to assess the impact of pre-embolization bevacizumab on liver <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computed tomography scans before and 4 weeks after PVE were evaluated in patients who received perioperative chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scans were compared with scans obtained in a control group in which no PVE was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Future liver remnant (FLR), total liver volume (TLV) and total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> volume (TTV) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bevacizumab was discontinued â‰¥ 4 weeks before PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 109 patients and 11 control patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Portal vein embolization induced a significant increase in TTV: the right lobe increased by 33.4% in PVE subjects but decreased by 34.8% in control subjects (P &lt; 0.001), and the left lobe increased by 49.9% in PVE subjects and decreased by 33.2% in controls (P= 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 52.8% of the study group received bevacizumab and 47.2% did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the two chemotherapy groups in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour growth</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median FLR after PVE was similar in both groups (28.8% vs. 28.7%; P= 0.825) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adequate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e> was achieved in patients who underwent PVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> was also observed post-embolization </plain></SENT>
