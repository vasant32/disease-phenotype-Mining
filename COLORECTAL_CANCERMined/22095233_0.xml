<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Alterations in different signaling pathways are involved in initiation and progression of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, such as those related to p53, MLH1, p16INK4a, Kras, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: This study was conducted with the aim to investigate the expression of p16INK4a and p53 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and evaluated their correlation with major clinicopathologic features and patients' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of p16INK4a and p53 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on 70 paraffin specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive immunostaining for p16INK4a and p53 was observed in 27 (38.6%) and 53 (80%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation between loss of p16INK4a expression and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was found (P=0.008), whereas overexpression of p16INK4a correlated with favorable prognosis parameters, such as absence of lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (P=0.029) and early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (P=0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, p53 overexpression significantly correlated with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location (P=0.022) and was related to a better overall survival in the group of patients with distal colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with p16INK4a-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> had a significant longer overall survival time than patients with p16INK4a-negative <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (P=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, Cox regression model showed that overexpression of p16INK4a is an independent factor for prognosis with depth of invasion, p53 accumulation, and coincident abnormal expression of p16INK4a or p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the assessment of both p53 and p16INK4a expression might be helpful in predicting prognosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
