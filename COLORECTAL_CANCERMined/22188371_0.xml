<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No previous studies have compared outcomes with and without SFM in laparoscopic and open <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to determine whether routine or selective SFM should be advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Data were collected prospectively on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> elective anterior resections for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in our unit between October 2006 and November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 263 resections, SFM data were recorded in 216; 138 were laparoscopic (32% with SFM, 3.6% converted) and 78 open (68% with SFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight were low anterior resections (LARs) for mid-low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e>, with 54 laparoscopic (50% with SFM) and 34 open (91% with SFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing laparoscopic with SFM to without, differences were found in the proportion of LARs (61%vs 29%, P&lt;0.001), defunctioning ileostomy rates (75%vs 46%, P=0.001) and operative time (median 255 vs 185 min, P&lt;0.001), with no differences in age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiology score, preoperative treatment, length of stay, lymph node yield, conversion rate, mortality, anastomotic leakage, reoperation, readmission and R0 resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in outcomes were seen between laparoscopic LARs with and without SFM or between open resections with and without SFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show no disadvantage in short-term clinical or oncological outcomes when SFM was avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic anterior resections with SFM take longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A selective approach to SFM is safe during anterior resection (open or laparoscopic), including mid-low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
