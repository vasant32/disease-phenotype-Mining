<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to identify CEC threshold proposal, by CellSearch system, for determining response to bevacizumab-based chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2007 to June 2008, 33 patients treated with FOLFOX4 plus bevacizumab were enrolled in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From January 2007 to June 2007, before bevacizumab was approved by the government in Japan, 31 patients treated with FOLFOX4 as a control were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CECs of whole blood at the baseline, day 4, 2 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy were isolated and counted using CellSearch system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no correlation between CEC levels and the outcome in the FOLFOX4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bevacizumab-based chemotherapy, CEC levels at the baseline were significantly associated with the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with 65 or more CECs at the baseline had a shorter median PFS and OS, than the median PFS and OS of less than 65 CECs at the baseline in the bevacizumab-based chemotherapy (P = 0.003, P = 0.027, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression, CEC levels (cut-off; 65) at the baseline indicated the strongest predictor for the outcome to bevacizumab-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A threshold of lower than 65 CECs, by the CellSearch System, at the baseline was a significant predictor of the outcome for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients treated with bevacizumab-based chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
