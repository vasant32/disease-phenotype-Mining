<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The MONW phenotype is defined as a BMI &lt;25, but fulfilling the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (MS) criteria with a modified waist circumference (≥90 cm for men and ≥85 cm for women) appropriate for Korean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 3,430 subjects (2,263 men and 1,167 women; 23-75 years old) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were diagnosed in 775 men and 199 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in males was 24.3% and in females 21.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant association between MONW and advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was found in men (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-3.47) but not in women (age-adjusted OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.50-6.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that men with MONW may have an increased risk of developing advanced colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> whereas this does not seem true for females </plain></SENT>
