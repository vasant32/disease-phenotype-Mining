<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The density and functionality of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is regulated by the antigen processing machinery through regulator proteins such as transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the in vivo association of those factors and their impact on prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TAP1, TAP2 and MHC class I antigen expression, inflammatory infiltrate and TIL (CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD20(+)) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 336 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The factors were correlated with each other and with clinic-pathological parameters and patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found TAP1 and TAP2 expression to be significantly associated with MHC class I antigen expression (TAP1: r = 0.363, P &lt; .001; TAP2: r = 0.393, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased density of CD8(+) TIL was predominantly found in TAP1, TAP2 and MHC class I antigen-positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased density of CD4(+) TIL was linked with TAP1 and TAP2, but not with MHC class I antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell count but not TAP1, TAP2 and MHC class I antigen expression had favorable prognostic impact in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (P = .003 and P = .003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data show that the expression of key components of the antigen processing machinery is tightly linked to the density of TIL, which are positive prognostic factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This implies that modulation of these factors may help to enhance antitumor <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> which in turn may improve patient prognosis </plain></SENT>
