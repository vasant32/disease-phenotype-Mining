<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we examined potential effect-modification between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at 10 of these loci and probable or established environmental risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in 7,016 CRC cases and 9,723 controls from nine cohort and case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used meta-analysis of an efficient empirical-Bayes estimator to detect potential multiplicative interactions between each of the SNPs [rs16892766 at 8q23.3 (EIF3H/UTP23), rs6983267 at 8q24 (MYC), rs10795668 at 10p14 (FLJ3802842), rs3802842 at 11q23 (LOC120376), rs4444235 at 14q22.2 (BMP4), rs4779584 at 15q13 (GREM1), rs9929218 at 16q22.1 (CDH1), rs4939827 at 18q21 (SMAD7), rs10411210 at 19q13.1 (RHPN2), and rs961253 at 20p12.3 (BMP2)] and select major <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk factors (sex, body mass index, height, smoking status, aspirin/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> use, alcohol use, and dietary intake of calcium, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, red meat, processed meat, vegetables, fruit, and fiber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest statistical evidence for a gene-environment interaction across studies was for vegetable consumption and rs16892766, located on chromosome 8q23.3, near the EIF3H and UTP23 genes (nominal P(interaction) = 1.3 Ã— 10(-4); adjusted P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the main effect of the SNP increased with increasing levels of vegetable consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other interactions were statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, the association of most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility loci identified in initial GWAS seems to be invariant to the other risk factors considered; however, our results suggest potential modification of the rs16892766 effect by vegetable consumption </plain></SENT>
