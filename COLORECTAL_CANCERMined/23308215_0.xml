<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, handling and processing of clinical specimens may significantly affect the molecular data obtained from their analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of tissue handling time on gene expression in human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> colon tissues undergoing routine surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from specimens of 15 patients at four time points (for a total of 180 samples) after surgery was analyzed for gene expression on high-density oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mixed-effects model was used to identify probes with different expression means across the four different time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The p-values of the model were adjusted with the Bonferroni method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two probe sets associated with tissue handling time in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> specimens, and thirty-one in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissues, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most genes exhibited moderate changes in expression over the time points analyzed; however four of them were oncogenes, and two confirmed the effect of tissue handling by independent validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a critical time point for tissue handling in colon seems to be 60 minutes at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the number of time-dependent genes we identified was low, the three genes that already showed changes at this time point in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> oncogenes, hence recommending standardization of tissue-handling protocols and effort to reduce the time from specimen removal to snap freezing accounting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1567664" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">warm ischemia</z:e> in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
