<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in pathogenesis and development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, lots of studies showed that there were associations between polymorphisms in the promoter regions of MMPs and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; however, the results remained inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify these associations, we conducted a meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a computerized literature search in the database of PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Medline (from January 2000 to July 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall and subgroup analysis based on the ethnicity of study population was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to evaluate these associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with software Review Manager (version 5.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 12 studies involving five polymorphic sites in four MMP genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For MMP1 (-1607), 2G polymorphism increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under dominant and recessive models (dominant, OR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.01-1.49; recessive, OR = 1.52, 95%CI 1.30-1.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For MMP3 (-1612), 6A/6A genotype increased this risk under the recessive model (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.04-1.70); however, this association was lost under the dominant model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For MMP2 -1306 C&gt;T, MMP3 -1171 5A&gt;6A, and MMP9 -1562 C&gt;T, there was no association between these polymorphisms and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> under the dominant and recessive models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of MMP1 (-1607) and MMP3 (-1612) increased the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>; these two polymorphic sites could be used as markers for early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, for MMP2 (-1306), MMP3 (-1171), and MMP9 (-1562), further studies with large sample size should be carried out </plain></SENT>
