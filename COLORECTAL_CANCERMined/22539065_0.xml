<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Rising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening rates in the last decade are attributable almost entirely to increased colonoscopy use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about factors driving the increase, but primary care physicians (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e>) play a central role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Explore <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e> attitudes toward screening colonoscopy and their associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening practice patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2006-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: 1,266 family physicians, general practitioners, general internists, and obstetrician-gynecologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN MEASURES: Physician-reported changes in the volume of screening tests ordered, performed or supervised in the past 3 years, attitudes toward colonoscopy, the influence of evidence and perceived norms on their recommendations, challenges to screening, and practice characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cooperation rate (excludes physicians without valid contact information) was 75%; 28% reported their volume of FOBT ordering had increased substantially or somewhat, and the majority (53%) reported their sigmoidoscopy volume decreased either substantially or somewhat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A majority (73%) reported that colonoscopy volume increased somewhat or substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (86%) strongly agreed that colonoscopy was the best of the available <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening tests; 69% thought it was readily available for their patients; 59% strongly or somewhat agreed that they might be sued if they did not offer colonoscopy to their patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three attitudes were significantly related to substantial increases in colonoscopy ordering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCPs</z:e> report greatly increased colonoscopy recommendation relative to other screening tests, and highly favorable attitudes about colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Greater emphasis is needed on informed decision-making with patients about preferences for test options </plain></SENT>
