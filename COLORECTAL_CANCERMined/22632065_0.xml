<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUNDS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> is one of the most common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Literature that focuses on the impact of the basic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752357" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">attributes, disease</z:e> characteristics and diarrhoea distress on the quality of life in diarrhoea patients is quite rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A longitudinal study design was employed with a three-month tracking period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were collected in structured, one-on-one interviews at one week and one, two and three months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variance and effects of quality of life were analysed by repeated-measures analysis of variance and generalised estimating equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients (n = 35) with diarrhoea after surgery will over time be gradually satisfied with their overall quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physical health satisfaction is lowest at 1 week after surgery, and it will over time gradually increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with mental health has the lowest score and does not improve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction with social relationships is highest between one week and two months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Satisfaction of environmental relationship will improve with time after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study results also indicate that patients with lower quality of life satisfaction are younger, women, have had R hemicolectomy and experience higher diarrhoea distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with diarrhoea after surgery will become more satisfied with their overall quality of life with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Physical and environmental satisfaction will <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Younger patients will be more dissatisfied with their social and environmental health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>More severe diarrhoea distress will impact patients' quality of life the most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These results can serve as reference for clinical care providers to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> after surgery </plain></SENT>
