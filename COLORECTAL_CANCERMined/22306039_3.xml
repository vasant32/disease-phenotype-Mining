<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The work was aimed at developing calcium-pectinate matrix tablet for colon-targeted delivery of meloxicam (MLX) microsponges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modified quassi-emulsion solvent diffusion method was used to formulate microsponges (MS), based on 3(2) full factorial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of volume of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15767">dichloromethane</z:chebi> and EudragitRS100 content (independent variables) were determined on the particle size, entrapment efficiency and %cumulative drug release of MS1-MS9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The optimized formulation, MS5 (d(mean)=44.47 Î¼m, %EE=98.73, %CDR=97.32 and followed zero order release) was developed into colon-targeted matrix tablet using calcium pectinate as the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimized colon-targeted tablet (MS5T2) shielded MLX loaded microsponges in gastrointestinal region and selectively delivered them to colon, as vizualized by vivo fluoroscopy in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic evaluation of MS5T2 in rabbits, revealed appearance of drug appeared in plasma after a lag time of 7h; a t(max) of 30 h with Fr=61.047%, thus presenting a formulation suitable for targeted colonic delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CLSM studies provided an evidence for colonic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> retentive ability of microsponges at the end of 8h upon oral administration of MS5T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus calcium pectinate matrix tablet loaded with MLX microsponges was developed as a promising system for the colon-specific delivery that has potential for use as an adjuvant therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
