<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the genetic analysis of KRAS mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> can be routinely conducted using DNA obtained on one occasion from one organ, from the primary or a metastatic site, whichever is preferentially available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the issue of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> resulting from acquired/intratumoral mutations remains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the possibility of acquired/intratumoral mutations in the KRAS gene has been reported by two research groups and has ranged from 7.4 to 15.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens were collected from advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with resected primary, and at least one metastatic, site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct sequence analysis was performed for KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA, and immunohistochemistry for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase II (GSTP) and EGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we identified an acquired mutation rate of approximately 11.1% in the KRAS gene (1/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This figure is not negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observation indicates, particularly in the case of metastatic recurrence after a long interval, that there may be considerable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> resulting from acquired or intratumoral mutations of the KRAS gene </plain></SENT>
