<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although experimental studies have shown that gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) has a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e>, epidemiologic evidence for a relationship between GGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the association between GGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence and assessed the role of alcohol consumption in this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined a cohort of 15 031 Japanese adults aged 40 to 79 years who attended a health checkup in 1995 and were free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GGT was measured using the Szasz method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants were then followed from 1 January 1996 until 31 December 2005, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence was recorded by using the Miyagi Regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each quartile of GGT and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest quartile (GGT &lt;13.0 IU/ml) was used as the reference category </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 1505 cancers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among participants in the highest quartile (GGT â‰¥31.0 IU/ml), the multivariate HR for any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.08-1.53; P for trend, &lt;0.001), the HR for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> was significantly greater than unity, and the HRs for esophageal, pancreatic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> were greater than unity but not significantly so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This positive trend was observed only in current drinkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between GGT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence only for alcohol-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in current drinkers and that the positive association of GGT with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence largely reflects alcohol consumption </plain></SENT>
