<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In the United States, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is the third leading cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> after breast and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous improvement programs have been implemented to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates, but few have focused on improving the care and management of patients with a diagnosis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As national medical organizations focus on quality of care, efforts are necessary to provide clinicians the opportunity for self-assessment and methods for practice improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this goal in mind, a national continuing medical education-certified performance improvement initiative was conceived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: THE INITIATIVE CONSISTED OF THREE STAGES: First, participants self-assessed their performance of predetermined topic measures through a review of patient charts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The topic areas included patient safety and supportive care, evidence-based surveillance, and evidenced-based treatment and were derived from current guidelines and other successful quality-improvement initiatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, an actionable plan for practice improvement was developed in at least one of the three topic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Third, after a period of self-improvement, participants reassessed their performance of the same topic measures to determine tangible changes in patient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 540 patient charts were reviewed by 27 clinicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notable results showed large gains in areas of supportive care, such as quantitative pain assessments and emotional well-being evaluations, which traditionally have been a minor focus of other quality-improvement initiatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants also showed tangible improvements in the performance of leading measures of quality care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings support the need for continued efforts toward performance improvement in both established and emerging areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patient care </plain></SENT>
