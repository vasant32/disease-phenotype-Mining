<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This observational retrospective study was performed in 160 French centres during a 2-week period in 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its main objective was to evaluate the rate of KRAS testing in patients with mCRC having initiated their first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives included time of process, techniques used and reasons for non-prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five hundred and thirty eight mCRC patients (67.1±11.3years, synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>: 69.9%) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KRAS testing was prescribed in 81.1% of patients, in a median of 15days after the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, and of 15days prior to the initiation of the first-line metastatic chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS status was available for 87% of patients, after 23.6±28.2days, but after the choice of the first-line therapy in 56.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneity</z:hpo> of reception time was noteworthy within regions (8.3±7days to 38.8±101days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>KRAS testing was not prescribed mainly due to the planned non-prescription of an anti-EGFR antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that KRAS testing is definitely part of the management of most of mCRC patients, despite discrepancies observed in the rate of prescription and the time of results </plain></SENT>
