<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate an endoscopic trimodal imaging (ETMI) system (high resolution, autofluorescence, and NBI) in the detection and differentiation of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective randomised trial of tandem colonoscopies was carried out using the Olympus XCF-FH260AZI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each colonic segment was examined twice for lesions, once with HRE and once with AFI, in random order per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> detected lesions were assessed with NBI for pit pattern and with AFI for colour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were removed and sent for histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any lesion identified on the second examination was considered as missed by the first examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> miss rates of AFI and HRE, and diagnostic accuracy of NBI and AFI for differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy with ETMI (47 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 47 patients examined with AFI first, 31 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in 15 patients were detected initially [detection rate 0.66 (0.52-0.75)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent HRE inspection identified six additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 47 patients examined with HRE first, 29 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> in 14 patients were detected initially [detection rate 0.62 (0.53-0.79)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Successive AFI yielded seven additional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> miss rates of AFI and HRE were 14% and 16.2%, respectively (p = 0.29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of AFI alone for differentiation was lower than NBI (63% vs. 80%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combined use of AFI and NBI achieved improved accuracy for differentiation (84%), showing a trend for superiority compared with NBI alone (p = 0.064) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AFI did not significantly reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> miss rate compared with HRE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>AFI alone had a disappointing accuracy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> differentiation, which could be improved by combination of AFI and NBI </plain></SENT>
