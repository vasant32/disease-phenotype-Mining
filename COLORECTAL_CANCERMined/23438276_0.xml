<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The upper lobe of his left lung and his left adrenal gland were resected because of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, 7 and 10 years after the initial surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to the middle lobe of the right lung and left adrenal gland were sequentially detected in 2007, and a multimodal therapy, consisting of the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, was conducted since 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemotherapy included drugs such as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, bevacizumab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>, and cetuximab </plain></SENT>
