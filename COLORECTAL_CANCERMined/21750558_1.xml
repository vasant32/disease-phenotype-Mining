<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1167791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin toxicity</z:e> (ST) was evaluated separately for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> and cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present analysis investigates the correlation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi>-attributed ST (Cape-ST) and parameters of treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with mCRC were randomised to cetuximab (400 mg m(-2), day 1, followed by 250 mg m(-2) weekly) plus CAPIRI (irinotecan 200 mg m(-2), day 1; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 800â€‰mg m(-2), twice daily, days 1-14, every 3 weeks), or cetuximab plus CAPOX (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> 130 mg m(-2), day 1; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">capecitabine</z:chebi> 1000 mg m(-2), twice daily, days 1-14, every 3 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 185 recruited patients, 149 (CAPIRI-C, n=78; CAPOX-C, n=71) received study treatment beyond the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> assessment and were evaluable for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi>-attributed ST, predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549410" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hand-foot syndrome</z:e>, was observed in 32.2% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31348">Capecitabine</z:chebi>-attributed ST grade 1-3 was associated with a significantly higher disease control rate (DCR) (97.9 vs 86.1%, P=0.038) compared with grade 0 toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Cape-ST grade 1-3 related to a markedly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (9.9 vs 5.6 months, P&lt;0.001) and overall survival (OS) (32.8 vs 22.4 months, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Separate analyses of treatment arms indicated that the effect of Cape-ST on PFS remained significant for both arms, whereas the effect on OS remained apparent as a strong trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This analysis supports the hypothesis that for the evaluated regimens, a correlation exists between Cape-ST and treatment efficacy regarding DCR, PFS, and OS </plain></SENT>
