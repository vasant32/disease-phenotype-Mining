<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of screening practices in the population controls of the multi-case control study (MCC-Spain) study and to evaluate its association with lifestyles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional analysis of 1505 population controls of the MCC-Spain study, aged 20-85, enrolled from 2008-2010 in five areas of Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of screening tests in the last 5 years was estimated and its association with lifestyles was assessed using logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most prevalent tests were mammography (98.2%, age 50-69 years) and cytology (94.5%, age 25-65 years) in women and prostate-specific antigen in men (71.5%, age 50 or over) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participation in fecal occult blood testing was lower (11.2% and 16.2% in women and men aged 50-74, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eating at least three pieces of fruit and vegetables per day was associated with higher participation in mammography (ORa: 5.24, 95% CI: 1.96-14.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In men, overweight-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was linked to higher participation in prostate-specific antigen testing (ORa: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.15-3.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In general, the presence of comorbidities was associated with utilization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of screening practices was high for breast, cervical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> and was low for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No common lifestyle patterns were associated with participation, although differences were found by sex and type of screening test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results may be useful to guide further studies on screening practices and review possible inefficiencies </plain></SENT>
