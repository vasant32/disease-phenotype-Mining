<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some data have shown that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> has carcinogenic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the present work, we determined concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> and its hydroxy metabolite (MTZOH) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MTZ and MTZOH were measured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> tissue and surrounding healthy tissue by LC-ESI-MS-MS method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found different concentration of MTZ and MTZOH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and healthy tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we noted a higher level of the above substances in women vs. men, both in healthy and cancerous gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that women are more exposed to a potential carcinogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6909">metronidazole</z:chebi> than men </plain></SENT>
