<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 564 (288 gynaecological, 208 breast and 68 colorectal) outpatient consultations of 141 patients were audio-recorded and analysed to identify discussed issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Issues were ranked from most to least commonly discussed within each disease group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Existing HRQoL instruments were evaluated against these lists and best fitting items entered into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific item banks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Item banks were evaluated during semi-structured interviews by twenty-one oncologists (13 consultants and 8 specialist registrars), four clinical nurse specialists and thirty patients, from breast, gynaecological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pilot questionnaires were completed by 448 (145 breast, 148 gynaecological and 155 colorectal) patients attending outpatient clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Item selection and scale reliability was explored using descriptive data and psychometric methods alongside qualitative patient and clinician ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each questionnaire includes five physical and three psychosocial function scales each with good internal consistency reliability (α &gt; 0.70) plus disease-specific individual-symptom items identified as useful in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific health-related quality of life measures were developed for use in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial analyses suggest good clinical utility and acceptable psychometric properties for the new instruments </plain></SENT>
