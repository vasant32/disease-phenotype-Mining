<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 2-6Â % of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> harbor NRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab is a backbone of most therapeutic regimens; however, biomarkers predicting its activity are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of mCRC with a Q61K NRAS mutation that had a favorable response to bevacizumab and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of ten patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NRAS or unknown NRAS status and mutated KRAS (NRAS and KRAS mutations are mutually exclusive) responded to the same regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that NRAS mutation merits further investigation as a potential biomarker predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab-based treatment </plain></SENT>
