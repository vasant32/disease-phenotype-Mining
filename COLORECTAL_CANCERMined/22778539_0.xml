<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy for screening the population at an average risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is recommended by many leading gastrointestinal associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective was to assess the quality, complications and acceptance rate of colonoscopy by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We prospectively gathered data from colonoscopies which were performed between October 2003 and September 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were asked to return a follow-up form seven days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those who failed to do so were contacted by phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>6584 patients were included (50.4% males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average age of subjects was 57.73 (SD 15.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening was the main indication in 12.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cecal intubation was achieved in 92% of patients and bowel preparation was good to excellent in 76.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The immediate outcome after colonoscopy was good in 99.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>Perforations</z:mpath> occurred in 3 cases-1 in every 2200 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in 3 cases (treated conservatively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>94.2% of patients agreed to undergo repeat colonoscopy in the future if indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The good quality of examinations, coupled with the low risk for complications and the good acceptance by the patients, encourages us to recommend colonoscopy as a primary screening test for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Israel </plain></SENT>
