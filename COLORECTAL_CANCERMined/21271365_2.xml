<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There have been few studies of tailored interventions to promote <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized trial of a tailored, interactive intervention to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients 50-70 years completed a baseline survey, were randomized to one of three groups, and attended a wellness exam after being exposed to a tailored intervention about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (tailored group), a public web site about <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (web site group), or no intervention (survey-only group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was completion of any recommended <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening by 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in screening by 6 months: 30%, 31%, and 28% of the survey-only, web site, and tailored groups were screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to the tailored intervention was associated with increased knowledge and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening self-efficacy at 2 weeks and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Family history, prior screening, stage of change, and physician recommendation moderated the intervention effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A tailored intervention was not more effective at increasing screening than a public web site or only being surveyed </plain></SENT>
