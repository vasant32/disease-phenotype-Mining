<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 255 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 255 clinically and histopathologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients were genotyped for IL-8 -251T&gt;A polymorphism employing allele-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative association of variant allele and genotypes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility risk was determined by calculating the odds ratios (ORs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Corresponding χ² tests on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients and controls were carried out and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies and its risk association were calculated using FAMHAP, haplotype association analysis software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On comparing the frequencies of genotypes of patients and controls, the homozygous variant AA was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (P = 0.002) compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigation on the association of the polymorphic genotypes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility risk, showed that the homozygous variant IL-8 -251AA had a significantly increased risk with OR 3.600 (95% CI: 1.550-8.481, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of allele frequencies, variant allele A of IL-8 -251 showed a significantly increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition with OR 1.32 (95% CI: 1.03-1.69, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Variant allele and genotype of IL-8 (-251T&gt;A) was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility risk and could be considered as a high-risk variant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
