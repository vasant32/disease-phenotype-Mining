<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A synergistic association of PIK3CA mutation with KRAS mutation has been suggested to increase AKT signaling and resistance to antiepidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy for advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, although studies have been conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to clarify this by examining PIK3CA mutation frequency in relation to other key molecular features of defined pathways of <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA mutation was assessed by high resolution melt analysis in 829 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples and 426 colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were independently correlated with clinicopathological features including patient age, sex and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location as well as molecular features including microsatellite instability, KRAS and BRAF mutation, MGMT methylation and the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the helical (Exon 9) and catalytic (Exon 20) domain mutation hotspots were also examined independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, PIK3CA mutation was positively correlated with KRAS mutation (p &lt; 0.001), MGMT methylation (p = 0.007) and CIMP (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel, exon-specific associations linked Exon 9 mutations to a subgroup of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> characterized by KRAS mutation, MGMT methylation and CIMP-Low, whilst Exon 20 mutations were more closely linked to features of serrated pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> including BRAF mutation, microsatellite instability and CIMP-High or Low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PIK3CA mutations were uncommonly, but exclusively, seen in tubulovillous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (4/124, 3.2%) and 1/4 (25.0%) tubulovillous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with a focus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
