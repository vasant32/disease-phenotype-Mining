<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Specialty of the endoscopist has been related to the postcolonoscopy interval risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of such a difference on the long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention rate by screening colonoscopy is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the efficacy and cost of colonoscopy screening according to the specialty of the endoscopist in 100,000 individuals aged 50 years until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postcolonoscopy interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (0.02%) and the relative risk (1.4) of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> between gastroenterologist (GI) endoscopists and non-GI endoscopists were extracted from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both efficacy and costs were projected over a steady-state US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eventual increase in endoscopic capacity when assuming <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures to be performed by GI endoscopists was simulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the simulation model, screening colonoscopy performed by non-GI endoscopists resulted in a 11% relative reduction in the long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> incidence prevention rate compared with the same procedure performed by GI endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When projected on the US population, the reduced non-GI efficacy resulted in an additional 3043 CRC cases and the loss of $200 million per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When increasing the relative risk from 1.4 to 2.0, the difference in the prevention rate between GI endoscopists and non-GI endoscopists increased to 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It increased further to 38% when also assuming a 3-fold increase in the risk of interval <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional 165 screening colonoscopies per endoscopist per year would be required to shift <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-GI procedures to GI endoscopists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When screening colonoscopy is performed by non-GI endoscopists, a substantial reduction in the long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention rate may be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Such difference appeared to be greater when a suboptimal efficacy of colonoscopy in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A 10-year saving of $2 billion may be expected when shifting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> screening colonoscopies from non-GI endoscopists to GI endoscopists </plain></SENT>
