<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients and relatives have varying preferences for genetic testing and interventions related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027672" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary cancer syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how the impact of these services on quality of life (QoL) affects the cost-effectiveness of screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> among probands newly diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We constructed a state-transition model comparing screening strategies (clinical criteria, prediction algorithms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> testing, and upfront germline testing) with no screening to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The model incorporated individuals' health state utilities after screening, germline testing, and risk-reducing surgeries, with utilities persisting for 12 months in the base case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes consisted of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost per QALY gained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity analyses assessed how the duration and magnitude of changes in QoL influenced results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiple screening strategies yielded gains in QALYs at acceptable costs compared with no screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preferred strategy-immunohistochemistry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> followed by BRAF mutation testing (IHC/BRAF)-cost $59,700 per QALY gained in the base case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration and magnitude of decreases in QoL after decisions related to germline testing and surgeries were key determinants of the cost-effectiveness of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IHC/BRAF cost &gt; $100,000 per QALY gained when decrements to QoL persisted for 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> in the population is likely to yield long-term gains in life expectancy that outweigh any short-term decreases in QoL, at acceptable costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Counseling for individuals should aim to mitigate potential negative impact of genetic testing and risk-reducing interventions on QoL </plain></SENT>
