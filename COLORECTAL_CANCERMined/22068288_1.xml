<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening rates remain low among low-income and minority populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing patients with screening information, activating them to ask for a screening test, and telephone barriers counseling improves <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates compared with providing screening information only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening information plus patient activation and barriers counseling (n = 138) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening information (n = 132) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Barriers counseling was attempted among activated patients if screening was not completed after one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening test completion was determined by medical record review at two months after the medical visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to determine whether activated patients were more likely to complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening, after adjustment for confounding factors (e.g., demographic characteristics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> knowledge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were African American (72.2%), female (63.7%), had annual household incomes less than $20,000 (60.7%), no health insurance (57.0%), and limited health literacy skills (53.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In adjusted analyses, more patients randomized to the activation group completed a screening test (19.6% vs. 9.9%; OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.14-5.56; P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, more activated patients reported discussing screening with their provider (54.4% vs. 27.5%, OR = 3.29, 95% CI: 1.95-5.56; P &lt; 0.001) and had more screening tests ordered (39.1% vs. 17.6%; OR = 3.40, 95% CI: 1.88-6.15; P &lt; 0.001) compared with those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient activation increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening rates among low-income minority patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: Innovative strategies are still needed to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening discussions, motivate providers to recommend screening to patients, as well as assist patients to complete ordered screening tests </plain></SENT>
