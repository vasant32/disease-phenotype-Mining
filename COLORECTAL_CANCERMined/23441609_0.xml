<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hypotheses are proposed to explain this association, via <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-induced oxidation of fat, heterocyclic <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi>, or N-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso compounds</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats have often been used to study these hypotheses, but the lack of enterosalivary cycle of nitrate in rats casts doubt on the relevance of this animal model to predict <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-associated human colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was thus designed to clarify whether a <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> intake that mimics the enterosalivary cycle can modulate <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-induced nitrosation and fat peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that, in contrast with the starting hypothesis, drinking water added with <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> to mimic the salivary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> content did not change the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> on biochemical markers linked to colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, notably <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and cytotoxic activity in the colon of rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, ingested <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> increased fecal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35800">nitroso-compounds</z:chebi> level, but their fecal concentration and their nature (iron-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16480">nitrosyl</z:chebi>) would probably not be associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We thus suggest that the rat model could be relevant for study the effect of red meat on colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, in spite of the lack of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> in the saliva of rats </plain></SENT>
