<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is general concern that high-risk patients are more susceptible to the adverse effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> and they are often denied laparoscopic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the impact of laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection for patients with high operative risk, which was defined as American Society of Anesthesiologist classes 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred thirty-five consecutive high-risk patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection by open or laparoscopic surgery were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics and operative outcomes were recorded prospectively, and comparison was made between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to open surgery, patients with laparoscopic resection had a shorter hospital stay (8 [6-12] vs. 6 [4-9] days; P &lt; 0.001), less blood loss (200 [100-400] vs. 140 [80-250] mL; P = 0.006), reduced cardiac complication rate (13.2% vs. 3.7%; P = 0.006), overall operative complication rate (36.6% vs. 21.3%; P = 0.006), and a trend toward a lower mortality rate (4.4% vs. 0.9%; P = 0.083) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in 3-year overall and disease-free survival between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Operative blood loss (P = 0.035; odds ratio = 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-6.78) and open surgery (P = 0.007; odds ratio = 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.23) were independent factors for occurrence of complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection is associated with more favorable short-term results and should be recommended as the preferred treatment option for high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
