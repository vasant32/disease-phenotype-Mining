<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This preoperative treatment has many effects which have to be analysed, like the safety of liver resection, toxicity, tissue regeneration, radiological and pathological response and survival data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of bevacizumab containing preoperative chemotherapy and functional recovery of the liver after resection for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CLM) and to analyse radiological and pathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data of three groups of 120 consecutive patients-(1) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> + BV: cytotoxic chemotherapy + bevacizumab, (2) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>: cytotoxic chemotherapy, (3) NC: no treatment before liver resection-were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative liver function and complications were compared, clinical, radiological and pathological data were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 01.12.2006 and 31.12.2010 41 resections was performed after chemotherapy + bevacizumab (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> + BV) and 27 resections was performed after preoperative chemotherapy without bevacizumab (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 60 hepatic resections in this period without neoadjuvant treatment (NC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8 patients had repeated resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complication rate was 40 % but there was no statistical difference between the groups (P = 0.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only the type of resection was associated with a significantly higher complication rate (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The subgroup of patients, who received irinotecan had a higher complication rate in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> group than in the BV + <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> group (55 % vs 41 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preoperative administration of bevacizumab was associated with higher peak postoperative AST, ALT levels but did not affect functional recovery of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The RECIST system was not able to predict the outcome after chemotherapy in every patient and in many cases this system overestimated the effect of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On histopathological examination the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was not associated with chemotherapy or pathological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Use of chemotherapy before hepatic resection of CLM was not associated with a significant increase in complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery of the liver was not affected by the preoperative administration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The use of combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy is safe before hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
