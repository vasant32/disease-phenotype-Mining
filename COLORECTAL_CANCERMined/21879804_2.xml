<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The revised 2004 Bethesda guidelines were developed to identify potential LS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate utilization and adequacy of the guidelines in general pathology practice and to determine if a universal LS screening approach increased the potential LS detection rate in newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Included were 445 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> surgically resected from November 2006 to March 2009, when reflex microsatellite instability (MSI) testing was based on histomorphology and age as well as 145 CRCs resected from July 2009 to July 2010 when a universal LS testing paradigm was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reflex MSI testing rates and MSI testing results were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall LS screening rate from November 2006 to March 2009 was 34.8%, and the extrapolated microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) rate was 8.5% (38/445) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strict adherence to the revised Bethesda guidelines, that is, without testing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> diagnosed in patients â€¡60 years, would have missed 26 (68.4%) MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall LS screening rate from July 2009 to July 2010 was 76.3% and the MSI-H rate was 20.6% (30/145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the MSI tested group, the untested group had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> removed by local excision (22.2% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.00035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The revised Bethesda guidelines are inadequate for LS screening when personal and family <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> history is not available to the pathologist, a universal screening paradigm greatly increased the rate of MSI testing and MSI-H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> detection and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> less likely to be screened for LS were those diagnosed in locally excised specimens </plain></SENT>
