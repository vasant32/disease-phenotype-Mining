<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these mutations disrupt the open reading frame of the genes involved and, as such, lead to constitutive inactivation of the mutated allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a subset of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> patients MSH2 was found to be specifically inactivated in cell lineages exhibiting EPCAM expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients carry deletions of the 3' end of the EPCAM gene, including its polyadenylation signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to concomitant transcriptional read-through of EPCAM, the promoter of MSH2 15Â kb further downstream becomes inactivated through hypermethylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As these 3' EPCAM deletions occur in the germline, this MSH2 promoter methylation ('epimutation') is heritable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Worldwide, numerous EPCAM 3' end deletions that differ in size and location have been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> in carriers of such EPCAM deletions is comparable to that of MSH2 mutation carriers, and is in accordance with a high expression of EPCAM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0476089" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">endometrial cancer</z:e> in the entire group of EPCAM deletion carriers is significantly lower than that in MSH2 mutation carriers, but the actual risk appears to be dependent on the size and location of the EPCAM deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations may have important implications for the surveillance of EPCAM deletion carriers and, thus, calls for an in-depth assessment of clinically relevant genotype-phenotype correlations and its underlying molecular mechanism(s) </plain></SENT>
