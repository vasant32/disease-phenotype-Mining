<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there may be a group of patients who are diagnosed with low volume and asymptomatic disease and who may be suitable for a WW plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From the South Australian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Registry for mCRC we examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> characteristics and outcomes of patients who were suitable for chemotherapy but had their treatment delayed by more than 3 months from diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: â€ƒ Data from 417 mCRC patients who received chemotherapy as first intervention have been entered in the Registry to date and 38 (9.1%) had chemotherapy commencement delayed by more than 3 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 76.7 years (range 38-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall 87% of patients had metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> with a median time to recurrence of 2.1 years (range 0.53-7.71) and 65.5% had single organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median delay from the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> to chemotherapy was 5.03 months (range 3-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median survival has yet to be reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year overall survival is 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that almost 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with mCRC had a delay in the initiation of chemotherapy, with most due to a WW approach based on case note review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a delay in chemotherapy initiation are more likely to have a single organ site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> and are older than those who do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the treatment delay, there is no evidence of a negative impact on survival </plain></SENT>
