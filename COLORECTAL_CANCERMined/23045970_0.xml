<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here preliminary immunohistochemical analyses on different human tissues are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for Tβ4 in human salivary glands show high quantities of Tβ4 before birth, followed by downregulation of expression in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Tβ4 is detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036095" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors of salivary glands</z:e>, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells might utilize fetal programs, including Tβ4 synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analyses in the gastrointestinal tract showed strong reactivity for Tβ4 in enterocytes during development, but weak immunostaining in mature enterocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, the association of a high expression of Tβ4 with epithelial-mesenchymal transition was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition could represent the unifying process that explains the role of Tβ4 during fetal development and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
