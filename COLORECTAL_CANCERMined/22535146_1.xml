<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Higher serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations have shown to be associated with an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used diet information to identify food groups that correlated with fasting serum concentrations of C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and assess the association of this dietary pattern and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Major food contributors to fasting C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations were identified with stepwise linear regression in a subsample (n = 833) of women from a large cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then summed the consumption frequency of the major food contributors to form a C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dietary pattern for the entire cohort (n = 66,714) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was computed using Cox proportional hazard model with the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dietary pattern score as the predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In up to 20 years of follow-up, we ascertained 985 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 758 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for confounders, the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dietary pattern, characterized by higher meat, fish, and sweetened beverage intake, but lower coffee, high fat dairy, and whole grains intake, showed direct association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (RR comparing extreme quintiles = 1.29, 95 % CI = 1.05-1.58, p trend = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same comparison was slightly stronger for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (RR = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.07-1.70, p trend = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stratified analysis, there was no association between the C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> dietary pattern and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> among lean and active women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, for overweight or sedentary women, RR for the same comparison was 1.58 (95 % CI = 1.20-2.07, p trend = 0.002) (p for interaction = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We derived a dietary pattern that correlated with C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This pattern was associated with an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, especially among women who were overweight or sedentary </plain></SENT>
