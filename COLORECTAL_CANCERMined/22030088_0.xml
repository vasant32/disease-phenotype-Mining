<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in the UGT1A6 enzyme are associated with delayed aspirin metabolism and greater chemopreventive efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of combining aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in relation to UGT1A6 T181A and R184S variants among 1,647 patients in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>Adenoma</z:mpath> Prevention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> (APC) trial who were stratified according to the use of low-dose aspirin after removal of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and randomized to placebo, 200-mg twice daily, or 400-mg twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent follow-up colonoscopies at 1 and 3 years to assess on-treatment efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 5 years, 538 patients underwent a colonoscopy to assess risk of recurrence after treatment was discontinued for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During treatment, the relative risk (RR) of recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59-0.79] for 200-mg twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.46-0.64) for 400-mg twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aspirin use was not independently associated with recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (RR, 0.98, 95% CI, 0.86-1.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results did not vary according to UGT1A6 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, among those with a variant UGT1A6 genotype on aspirin, the RR of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> was 1.60 (95% CI, 0.81-3.15) after withdrawal of 200-mg twice daily and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.06-3.70) after withdrawal of 400-mg twice daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with withdrawal of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no increased risk associated with discontinuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> among any other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Concurrent use of low-dose aspirin does not influence the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, discontinuing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> among aspirin-using individuals who initially developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> despite a UGT1A6 variant genotype resulted in rapid reemergence of disease </plain></SENT>
