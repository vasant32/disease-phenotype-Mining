<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination chemotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU), leucovorin, irinotecan and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> (FOLFOXIRI) in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This phase I dose-finding study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended dose (RD) or both of FOLFOXIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="15" ids="17659">UDP</z:chebi>-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*6/*6, *28/*28 and *6/*28 genotypes were excluded, because these UGT1A1 genotypes are linked to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 10 Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MTD of FOLFOXIRI in these Japanese patients was 165 mg/m(2) irinotecan, 85 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and 2,400 mg/m(2) 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the RD of FOLFOXIRI was determined to be 150 mg/m(2) irinotecan, 85 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> and 2,400 mg/m(2) 5-FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Toxic effects, evaluated until the completion of 4 cycles, were manageable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> occurred in 27% of cycles, but there was no febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 9 assessable patients, the objective response rate was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We thus determined the RD of FOLFOXIRI in Japanese patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who do not have UGT1A1*28/*28, *6/*6 or *6/*28 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that FOLFOXIRI is a well-tolerated regimen for these Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
