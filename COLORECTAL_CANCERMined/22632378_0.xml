<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bowel screening started in Ayrshire and Arran in September 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the impact of this screening on the diagnosis and stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and characterize screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> in comparison with those diagnosed through other pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Diagnoses were identified from an audit database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Referrals were grouped into screen detected, routine, urgent and emergency presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2001 and December 2010, 2289 diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 2001 to 2006, the mean (range) number of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal-cancer</z:e> diagnoses per year was 210 (198-220) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between 2007 and 2010, the mean (range) number of diagnoses per year was 256 (239-274), a significant (P = 0.008) increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since September 2007, 877 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> have been diagnosed: 17% were screen detected; 11% were detected as a result of routine GP referral; 51% were detected after urgent GP referral; and 21% were emergency presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNM stage increased with urgency of referral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately two-thirds (66%) of screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were node negative vs 25% of emergency presentations (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were distal to the splenic flexure (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screened <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> had favourable pathology; lower T and N stages (both P &lt; 0.001), less venous invasion (P &lt; 0.001) and better differentiation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen after stratification for TNM stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Screening has not yet resulted in a significant shift towards early-stage disease since 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening has been associated with an increase in the numbers of both new and early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Screen-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> are predominantly early-stage disease with favourable pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At present, it remains to be seen whether screening will ultimately translate into an overall reduction in advanced-stage disease </plain></SENT>
