<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> included dietary fat intake; consequently, the role of genes in the fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways is of particular interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> has been associated with different type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels could be affected by genetic factors, including polymorphisms in the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism pathway </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression and association analysis were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several LIPC (lipase, hepatic) polymorphisms were found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk, although no particular haplotype was related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
