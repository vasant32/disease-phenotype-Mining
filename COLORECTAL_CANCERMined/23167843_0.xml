<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported associations between a variant allele in a let-7 microRNA complementary site (LCS6) within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of KRAS (rs61764370) and clinical outcome in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> (mCRC) patients receiving cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variant allele has also been associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to reveal the incidence of the variant allele in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening population and to investigate the clinical relevance of the variant allele in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX (bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi>/folinic acid and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>) +/- cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The feasibility of the variant allele as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was investigated by comparing the LCS6 gene frequencies in 197 CRC patients, 1060 individuals with colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, and 358 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between clinical outcome and LCS6 genotype was analyzed in 180 mCRC patients receiving Nordic FLOX and 355 patients receiving Nordic FLOX + cetuximab in the NORDIC-VII trial (NCT00145314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LCS6 frequencies did not vary between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients (23%), individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> (20%), and healthy controls (20%) (P = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the NORDIC-VII cohort even if numerically increased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found in patients with the LCS6 variant allele (8.5 (95% CI: 7.3-9.7 months) versus 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.4-8.3 months), P = 0.16 and 23.5 (95% CI: 21.6-25.4 months) versus 19.5 months (95% CI: 17.8-21.2 months), P = 0.31, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Addition of cetuximab seemed to improve response rate more in variant carriers than in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> carriers (from 35% to 57% versus 44% to 47%), however the difference was not statistically significant (interaction P = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The LCS6 variant allele does not seem to be a risk factor for development of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant effect of the LCS6 variant allele on response rate, PFS or OS was found in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX +/- cetuximab </plain></SENT>
