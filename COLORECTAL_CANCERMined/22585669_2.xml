<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been postulated that long-term use of beta blockers might decrease the risk of certain types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> because of weakening of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) yielded inconsistent results, but lacked information on covariates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the authors investigated the association of beta blocker use and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in a large population-based case-control study (DACHS study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 2003 and 2007, information on beta blocker use and potential confounders was collected by personal interviews for 1762 CRC cases and 1708 control individuals from Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk and beta blocker use and subclasses of beta blockers was estimated by multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, site- and stage-specific analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, no association was observed with beta blocker use (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-1.29) or with duration of beta blocker use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the analysis by subclasses of beta blockers (cardioselectivity) and active ingredients (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6904">metoprolol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3127">bisoprolol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3441">carvedilol</z:chebi>, and atenolol) or by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> subsite showed no associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stage-specific analyses, long-term beta blocker use (6+ years) was associated with a significantly higher risk of stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.25-3.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our adjusted results do not support the hypothesis that beta blocker use is associated with decreased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we found a positive association of long-term beta blocker use and risk of stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter result should be further evaluated in future studies </plain></SENT>
