<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with a colon-specific pro-carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride to achieve the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination was performed for the analysis of neoplastic lesions while flow cytometry was performed for the relative quantification of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), differential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential (MMP or ΔΨ (M)), and apoptotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various target biomolecules were analyzed either for their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> or protein expression profiles via RT-PCR and quantitative Real-Time PCR, or Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhanced gene as well as protein expression of pro-apoptotic agents was observed with the daily oral administration of two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> viz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> (cyclooxygenase (COX)-non-specific) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> (a selective COX-2 inhibitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in early growth response-1 (EGR-1) protein expression and nuclear localization in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> co-administered animals may have positively regulated the expression of NAG-1 with a significant enhancement of intracellular ROS in turn decreasing the ΔΨ (M) to initiate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In silico molecular docking analysis also showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9352">Sulindac</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">Celecoxib</z:chebi> can block the active site pocket of B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>-extra large (Bcl-xL, anti-apoptotic transmembrane <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> protein) which could be a putative mechanism followed by these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> to overcome anti-apoptotic properties of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi>-mediated up-regulation of EGR-1 and thereby NAG-1 along with implication of higher ROS load may positively regulate the intrinsic pathway of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> for the chemoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
