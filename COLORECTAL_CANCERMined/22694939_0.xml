<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the effect of coffee intake on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk, we performed a meta-analysis based on both case-control and cohort studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Review study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: We identified case-control and cohort studies related to coffee consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk listed on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, Science Citation Index and PubMed (until May 2011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Research literature on the relationship between coffee consumption and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five case-control (15 522 cases) and sixteen cohort studies (10 443 cases) were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparing the highest v. the lowest/non category of coffee consumption, the combined results from case-control studies showed a significant relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0·85, 95 % CI 0·75, 0·97) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 0·79, 95 % CI 0·67, 0·95), but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0·95, 95 % CI 0·79, 1·15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For cohort studies, there was a slight suggestion of an inverse association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (relative ratio = 0·94; 95 % CI 0·88, 1·01) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> (OR = 0·93, 95 % CI 0·86, 1·01), rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (OR = 0·98, 95 % CI 0·88, 1·09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analyses using case-control studies, significant inverse associations were found in females for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and in Europe for colorectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, while the subgroup analyses of cohort studies found that coffee drinks substantially decreased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> only in Asian women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results from case-control studies suggest coffee consumption can significantly decrease the risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, especially in Europe and for females </plain></SENT>
