<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the palliative role of radiotherapy (RT) and define the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined with palliative RT (CCRT) in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From August 1995 to December 2007, 80 patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> were treated with palliative RT at Samsung Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial presenting symptoms were pain (68 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (18 cases), and obstruction (nine cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pelvic mass originated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> in 58 patients (73%) and from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in 22 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially 72 patients (90%) were treated with surgery, including 64 complete local excisions; 77% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and 81% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total RT dose ranged 8-60 Gy (median: 36 Gy) with 1.8-8 Gy per fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the α/β for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was assumed to be 10 Gy for the biologically equivalent dose (BED), the median RT dose was 46.8 Gy10 (14.4-78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty one patients (26%) were treated with CCRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptom palliation was assessed one month after the completion of RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptom palliation was achieved in 80% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the median follow-up period of five months (1-44 months), 45% of the cases experienced reappearance of symptoms; the median symptom control duration was five months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median survival after RT was six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, the only significant prognostic factor for symptom control duration was BED ≥40 Gy10 (p &lt; 0.05), and CCRT was a marginally significant factor (p = 0.0644) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, BED and CCRT were significant prognostic factors for symptom control duration (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RT was an effective palliation method in patients with a symptomatic pelvic mass of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For improvement of symptom control rate and duration, a BED ≥ 40 Gy10 is recommended when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Considering the low morbidity and improved symptom palliation, CCRT might be considered in patients with good performance status </plain></SENT>
