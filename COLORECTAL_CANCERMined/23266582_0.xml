<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, rates of irresectable disease at laparotomy for colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) have ranged from 15 to 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic laparoscopy has been shown to be effective at preventing nontherapeutic laparotomy in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the resectability rate and role of diagnostic laparoscopy in a contemporary cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a prospectively maintained database, we identified patients who were explored for presumed resectable CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and pathologic data associated with the finding of irresectable disease were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2008-2010, 455 patients were explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 35 (7.7%) did not undergo a resection and/or ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 patients with irresectable disease, 15 (43%) had disease limited to the liver, 17 (49%) had extrahepatic disease (EHD), and 3 (9%) had other reasons precluding resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the whole cohort, 45 patients (9.9%) were found to have EHD, and 27 of these (60%) underwent complete resection or ablation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only factor associated with irresectable disease was a prior history of EHD, which was present in 29% of those found irresectable versus 13% of those resected (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed in 55 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of these patients had irresectable disease, and three were spared unnecessary laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the yield was 5% and the sensitivity 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The finding of irresectable disease is a rare event with modern radiologic assessment and the expansion of indications for resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic laparoscopy has a low yield and should be considered if there is a history of EHD or suspicious findings on preoperative imaging </plain></SENT>
