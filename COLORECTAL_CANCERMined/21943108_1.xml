<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:mp ids='MP_0003711'>Pathological angiogenesis</z:mp> is associated with various human diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 system plays critical roles in several steps of angiogenic remodelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated the anti-angiogenic effect of a novel angiopoietin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using computational methods, we identified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from helical segments within angiopoietins, which were predicted to inhibit their activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were tested using biochemical methods and models of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> with best efficacy, A11, was selected for further characterization as an anti-angiogenic compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KEY RESULTS: The potent anti-angiogenic activity of A11 was demonstrated in a multicellular assay of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and in the chorioallantoic membrane model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A11 bound to angiopoietins and reduced the binding of Ang-2 to Tie2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A11 was also significantly reduced vascular density in a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its ability to inhibit Ang-2 but not Ang-1-induced endothelial cell migration, and to down-regulate Tie2 levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> microvessels, suggests that A11 targets the Ang-Tie2 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of oxygen-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, A11 strongly inhibited <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, combination of A11 with an anti-VEGF antibody showed a trend for further inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, suggesting an additive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that A11 is a potent anti-angiogenic compound, through modulation of the Ang-Tie2 system, underlining its potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of ocular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> neovascularization, as well as other pathological conditions that are dependent on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
