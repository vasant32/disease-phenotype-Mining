<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in the elderly is a major undertaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data on the outcome and survival of elderly patients who underwent laparoscopic resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study of patients older than 75 years compared outcome and survival between those who underwent laparoscopic resection and those who had open resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2000 to 2009, 434 patients ages 75 years and older who underwent elective resection for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> or had undergone emergency operations were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative diagnosis was determined by colonoscopy, and computed tomography scan was performed for preoperative staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data on the patients' demographics, operative details, pathology results, postoperative results, and survival were collected prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were compared with those who had open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 434 patients (210 men) with a median age of 80 years (range 75-95 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these 434 patients, 189 underwent laparoscopic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (4.8%) required conversion to open operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients did not differ in terms of age, gender, incidence of medical comorbidities, or stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median operating time was longer in the laparoscopic group, but the blood loss was significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic resection was associated with a lower mortality rate and a shorter hospital stay (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The open resection group had significantly more cardiac complications (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the patients who had laparoscopic resections and those who had open surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients older than 75 years, laparoscopic resection of colon is associated with less intraoperative blood loss, a shorter hospital stay, fewer cardiac complication, and a lower mortality rate than open resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors recommend laparoscopic resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> as the treatment of choice for elderly patients </plain></SENT>
