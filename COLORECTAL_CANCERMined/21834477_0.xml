<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have examined 50 pts surgically treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> on at least 5 years follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNM, grading score and survival have been compared to CD10 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four out of fifty cases have been analyzed (18 males and 16 female) of whom nineteen were CD10 positive and fifteen were CD10 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 cases were droping out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in survival rate between CD10 positive and negative in N0, N1, N2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference on survival rate and grading 1, 2, 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have then analyzed CD10 positive and CD10 negative cases, according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> grading, in patients with positive linphonodes N1 and N2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We showed a statistical difference between the CD10 positive/N2 (grading 1.66 +/- 0.5) and the CD10 negative/N2 (grading 3) (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We can hypothesize that CD10 positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> display a more invasive behaviour, independently from the N score and the G score, compared to CD10 negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
