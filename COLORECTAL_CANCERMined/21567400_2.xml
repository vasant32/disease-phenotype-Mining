<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is an important factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which SDF-1 mediates uPA expression in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cells remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the molecular mechanism governing the interaction between SDF-1 stimulation and uPA expression in three human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines (DLD-1, SW48, and COLO 205) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that SDF-1 stimulation led to an increase in the expression and secretion of uPA in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments involving specific inhibitors and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> demonstrated that the activation of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways are critical for SDF-1-induced uPA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of transcription factor binding using ELISA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SDF-1 increased Sp1- and AP-1-DNA-binding activities in DLD-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Sp1 and AP-1 activation blocked the SDF-1-induced expression and activity of the uPA promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of SDF-1 on DLD-1 signaling and uPA expression was mediated by the CXCR4/Î²1 integrin axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our findings elucidate the mechanisms of SDF-1/CXCR4 downstream signaling and provide insights into the function of SDF-1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
