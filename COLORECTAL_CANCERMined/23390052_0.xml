<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cosmc is a molecular chaperone required for the formation of an active T-synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of T antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the expression and role of Cosmc in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, real-time PCR showed that overexpression of Cosmc <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> compared with paired non-tumorous tissues was associated with increased American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> (AJCC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of Cosmc in HCT116 cells significantly increased T antigen expression and enhanced cell growth, migration, and invasion, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> kinase (FAK), ERK, and Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These Cosmc-enhanced malignant phenotypes were significantly suppressed by specific inhibitor of MEK or PI3K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that Cosmc overexpression increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and decreased survival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, knockdown of Cosmc with siRNA in SW480 cells decreased malignant behaviors and the signaling pathways, which were substantially reversed by constitutively active Akt or MEK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that Cosmc promotes malignant phenotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells mainly via activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, and that Cosmc may serve as a potential target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> treatment.
