<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The axonal guidance cues that organize this precise projection pattern are only beginning to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To aid in their identification and characterization, we generated a transgenic zebrafish line, OR111-7:IRES:Gal4, in which a small subset of olfactory sensory neurons is labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most sensory neurons expressing the OR111-7 transgene project to a specific location within the bulb, the central zone protoglomerulus, while a smaller number project to the lateral glomerulus 1 protoglomerulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting Netrin/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> (deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>) signaling perturbs the ability of OR111-7-expressing axons to enter the olfactory bulb and alters their patterns of termination within the bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Netrin receptor <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> is expressed in olfactory sensory neurons around the time that they elaborate their axons, netrin1a is expressed near the medial-most margin of the olfactory bulb, and netrin1b is expressed within the ventral region of the bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of Netrin/<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> signaling components causes some OR111-7-expressing sensory axons to wander posteriorly after exiting the olfactory pit, away from netrin-expressing areas in the bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>OR111-7-expressing axons that enter the bulb target the central zone less precisely than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, spreading away from netrin-expressing regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These pathfinding errors can be corrected by the reexpression of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> within OR111-7 transgene-expressing neurons in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi> morphant embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings implicate Netrins as the only known attractants for olfactory sensory neurons, first drawing OR111-7-expressing axons into the bulb and then into the ventromedially positioned central zone protoglomerulus </plain></SENT>
