<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exosomes are microvesicles that are released from various cells into the extracellular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the components within exosomes vary according to the type of secreted cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the tetraspanin family proteins CD63, CD9 and CD81 as useful collection markers of exosomes derived from the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines HCT-15, SW480 and WiDr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we aimed to detect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, microRNAs and natural antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> within the exosomes secreted from the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we examined whether exosomes containing their <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> were transferred into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cell line HepG2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> cell line A549 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD81 was detected in exosomes secreted from the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that CD81 can be a collection marker of exosomes derived from the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> species within exosomes derived from the three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were examined, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> of housekeeping genes such as ACTB and GAPDH, the microRNAs such as miR-21, miR-192 and miR-221, and the natural antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> of LRRC24, MDM2 and CDKN1A genes, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We discovered their natural antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> within exosomes for the first time in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PKH67-labeled exosomes derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines were taken up into HepG2 and A549 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the intracellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> enclosed within exosomes are secreted to the outside, and exosomes derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines are transferred into HepG2 and A549 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we reveal that exosomes derived from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines contain <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>, microRNAs and natural antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi>, and can be delivered into HepG2 and A549 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that exosomal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> can shuttle between cells, and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in recipient cells </plain></SENT>
