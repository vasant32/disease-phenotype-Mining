<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Indisulam (N-(-3-chloro-7-indolyl)-1,4-benzenedisulfonamide; E7070) is an experimental anticancer agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis indicates that indisulam downregulates several genes involved in drug resistance, and this finding led us to test the effect of combining indisulam with other anticancer drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the antitumor effect and mechanism of synergism when indisulam was administered in combination with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro cytotoxic activity was examined using a cell counter kit, and the combination effect was determined by isobologram analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of topoisomerase IIα was measured by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vivo antitumor effect was assessed in mice inoculated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> SW620 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Isobologram analysis indicated that a 24-h exposure to indisulam and SN-38, an active metabolite of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11, had a synergistic effect in HCT116 and SW620 cells and an additive effect in HCT15 and WiDr cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of exposure to 48 h resulted in a synergistic effect in HCT15 and WiDr cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with SN-38 alone increased the amount of intracellular topoisomerase IIα in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment with indisulam suppressed the SN-38-induced upregulation of topoisomerase IIα after 24 h of exposure in HCT116 and SW620 cells and after 48 h of exposure in HCT15 and WiDr cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This apparent association between a synergistic effect and suppression of SN-38-mediated upregulation of topoisomerase IIα suggests that indisulam enhances SN-38 cytotoxicity by suppressing topoisomerase IIα upregulation to compensate for topoisomerase I inhibition by SN-38 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Synergy was also observed in xenografted <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and was accompanied by complete suppression of topoisomerase IIα upregulation induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations prompted the clinical evaluation of indisulam and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 combination therapy </plain></SENT>
