<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed to evaluate the association of these two variants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> susceptibility via the meta-analysis methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For variant TGFBR1*6A, nine reports including 6,765 CRC patients and 8,496 unrelated controls were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The heterozygotes *6A/*9A showed a significant increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with the pooled OR was 1.12 (95% CI = 1.02-1.23), and the pooled OR for the homozygotes *6A/*6A was 1.13 (95% CI = 0.80-1.58) compared to the homozygotes *9A/*9A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, under the dominant effect model, the TGFBR1*6A carriers showed a significantly increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (pooled OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23, *6A/*6A and *6A/*9A vs. *9A/*9A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For variant Int7G24A, three case-control studies with 1,074 cases and 1,945 controls were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no significant association was found for heterozygosity Int7G24A carriers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk (pooled OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.67-1.42), the homozygosity A/A carriers showed a significant elevated risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (pooled OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.14-2.47) compared to G/G homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Under the recessive effect model, homozygotes A/A showed a 71% increase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk compared to the A/G and G/G genotype carriers (pooled OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.17-2.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggested that the two polymorphisms of TGFBR1 may confer low-penetrance susceptibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
