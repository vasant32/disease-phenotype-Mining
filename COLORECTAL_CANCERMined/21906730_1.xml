<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 2008 to October 2010, 27 patients with 35 hepatic metastatic lesions (mean size 1.99cm; range 0.7-3.8cm) underwent RFA using ICW electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 35 tumours, 32 had diameters ≤3cm, and three had diameters of 3-4cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 18 tumours were non-subcapsular and 17 were subcapsular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients (0%) had major complications after RFA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (median 27 months; range 4.5-36 months), 14 of the 35 treated lesions (40%) showed local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e>-free survival rates at 1 and 3 years were 73 and 56%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour progression</z:e>-free survival period was significantly longer in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> ≤2cm than &gt;2cm (p&lt;0.001), but did not differ significantly between patients with non-subcapsular and subcapsular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p=0.454) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall 1 and 3 year survival rates after RFA were 100 and 77%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous RFA using ICW electrodes is safe and technically feasible for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It provides effective local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> control with low complication rates and reduced number of needle placements </plain></SENT>
