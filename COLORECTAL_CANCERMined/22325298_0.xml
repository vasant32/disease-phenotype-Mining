<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its dose-limiting toxicity is the development of a painful neuropathic syndrome sustained by unclear mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the oxidative hypothesis is a matter of debate, direct data about oxidative damage induced in vivo by anticancer agents are lacking and the efficacy of the available <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compounds are unsatisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a rat model of painful <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> (2.4 mgkg(-1) i.p., daily for 21 days), we described an important component of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the plasma of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-treated rats, the increases in carbonylated protein and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substances were the index of the resultant protein oxidation and lipoperoxidation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same pattern of oxidation was revealed also in the sciatic nerve, and in the spinal cord where the damage reached the DNA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> compound silibinin (100 mgkg(-1) per os), administered once a day, starting from the first day of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> injection until the 20th, prevented oxidative damage as did α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repetitive administration of silibinin, as well as α-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="27013">tocopherol</z:chebi>, reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-dependent pain induced by mechanical and thermal stimuli </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antineuropathic effect of both molecules improved by about 50% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi>-induced behavioral alterations </plain></SENT>
