<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35218,38697">anthocyanins</z:chebi> (ACs) in black raspberries are responsible, at least in part, for their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-inhibitory effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we asked if ACs are responsible for the demethylation effects observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25 μg/ml suppressed activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and SW480 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of some of these genes was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of β-catenin and c-Myc, downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although it was reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, DNMT3B did not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that ACs are responsible, at least in part, for the demethylation effects of whole black raspberries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
