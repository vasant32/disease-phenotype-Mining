<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous resection of primary colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) and synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (SLMs) is subject of debate with respect to morbidity in comparison to staged resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate our initial experience with this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and a clinical diagnosis of SLM underwent combined laparoscopic colorectal and liver surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> was located in the colon in two patients and in the rectum in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SLM was solitary in four patients and multiple in the remaining patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical approach was total laparoscopic (2 patients) or hand-assisted laparoscopic (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The midline umbilical or transverse suprapubic incision created for the hand port and/or extraction of the specimen varied between 5 and 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median operation time was 303 (range 151-384) minutes with a total blood loss of 700 (range 200-850) mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative hospital stay was 5, 5, 9, 14, and 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An R0 resection was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>From this initial single-center experience, simultaneous laparoscopic colorectal and liver resection appears to be feasible in selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and SLM, with satisfying short-term results </plain></SENT>
