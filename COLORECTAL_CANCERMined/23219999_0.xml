<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Caspases are cysteine proteases that regulate embryonic development, cell differentiation, tissue homoeostasis, and removal of damaged and harmful cells from the intestine and other parts of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspase activity is mainly regulated at the posttranslational level, which allows their rapid activation and response to cellular stress and pathogenic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cell types, caspases are initially expressed as inactive proenzymes, which undergo proteolytic cleavage to become functional enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Caspase dysfunction has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal diseases</z:e>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the roles of caspases have been studied extensively in regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, recent discoveries have highlighted cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-independent functions of this protein family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, caspase-1, caspase-4, caspase-5, and caspase-12 are activated during innate immune responses and participate in the formation of the inflammasome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caspase-8 controls necroptosis of Paneth cells and potentially the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of intestinal epithelial cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and appears to be involved in mucosal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regulators of caspase-8 might therefore be used to prevent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improving our understanding of the regulation and function of caspases in the intestine might lead to new therapeutics for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001858'>intestinal inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
