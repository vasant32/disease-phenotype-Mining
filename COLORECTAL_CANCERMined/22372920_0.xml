<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Where proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapies remain unfunded, patients are faced with difficult decisions regarding personally covering some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the treatment cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials provide an alternative form of access to unfunded drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To examine the patient population and utilisation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cetuximab Interim Access Programme (IAP) in Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed de-identified data collected as part of the costsharing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cetuximab IAP in Australia, which extended from June 2005 until November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impact of the CO20 clinical trial that opened in early 2008 and provided free access to cetuximab was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-eight patients received â‰¥1 treatment on the IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age of participants was lower than the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> population (61 vs 71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A greater uptake by males was limited to patients over 65 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Socioeconomic status correlated with programme enrolment, and there appeared to be lower uptake among regional patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority (93%) of patients received combination treatment with irinotecan, with a trend towards increasing use of single-agent cetuximab over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time-on-treatment was longer in patients treated with combination therapy than with monotherapy (12 vs 8 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CO20 trial had minimal impact on IAP enrolment and approximately doubled the number of Australian patients receiving cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients' age and gender in older patients impacted on participation in the IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both the IAP and the CO20 trial contributed to a substantial proportion of Australian patients accessing an unfunded treatment, with an estimated 50% of the eligible patient population receiving cetuximab </plain></SENT>
