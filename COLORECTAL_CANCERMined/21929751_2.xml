<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenograft growth was arrested following treatment with liposomal preparation of siDCAMKL-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have utilized Nanoparticle (NP) technology to deliver DCAMKL-1 specific siRNA to knockdown potential key <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> regulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>/miRNA were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR and protein by western blot/immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>siDCAMKL-1 was encapsulated in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53493">Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)</z:chebi>-based NPs (NP-siDCAMKL-1); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> xenografts were generated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>nude</z:mp> mice, treated with NP-siDCAMKL-1 and DAPT (Î³-secretase inhibitor) alone and in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To measure let-7a and miR-144 expression in vitro, HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the firefly luciferase gene with let-7a and miR-144 miRNA binding sites in the 3'UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Administration of NP-siDCAMKL-1 into HCT116 xenografts resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath>, downregulation of proto-oncogene c-Myc and Notch-1 via let-7a and miR-144 miRNA-dependent mechanisms, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A corresponding reduction in let-7a and miR-144 specific luciferase activity was observed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, an upregulation of EMT inhibitor miR-200a and downregulation of the EMT-associated transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail and Slug were observed in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lastly, DAPT-mediated inhibition of Notch-1 resulted in HCT116 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> and down regulation of Notch-1 via a miR-144 dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that nanoparticle-based delivery of siRNAs directed at critical targets such as DCAMKL-1 may provide a novel approach to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> through the regulation of endogenous miRNAs </plain></SENT>
