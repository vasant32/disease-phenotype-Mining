<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Germline mutations in MMR genes are responsible for the development of the hereditary form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various mutations mainly in two MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, have been identified so far, whereas 55% are detected within MLH1, the essential component of the heterodimer MutLα (MLH1 and PMS2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of those MLH1 variants are pathogenic but the relevance of missense mutations often remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many different recombinant systems are applied to filter out disease-associated proteins whereby fluorescent tagged proteins are frequently used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, dye labeling might have deleterious effects on MutLα's functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of N- and C-terminal fluorescent labeling on expression level, cellular localization and MMR activity of MutLα </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides significant influence of GFP- or Red-fusion on protein expression we detected incorrect shuttling of single expressed C-terminal GFP-tagged PMS2 into the nucleus and found that C-terminal dye labeling impaired MMR function of MutLα </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, N-terminal tagged MutLαs retained correct functionality and can be recommended both for the analysis of cellular localization and MMR efficiency </plain></SENT>
