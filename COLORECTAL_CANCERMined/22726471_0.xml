<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in the Asia-Pacific region in the past decade has resulted in recommendations to implement mass <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the knowledge of screening and population screening behaviors between countries is largely lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This multicenter, international study investigated the association of screening test participation with knowledge of, attitudes toward, and barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests in different cultural and sociopolitical contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Person-to-person interviews by using a standardized survey instrument were conducted with subjects from 14 Asia-Pacific countries/regions to assess the prevailing screening participation rates, knowledge of and attitudes toward and barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and screening tests, intent to participate, and cues to action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of the primary endpoint, screening participation was determined from subanalyses performed for high-, medium-, and low-participation countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 7915 subjects (49% male, 37.8% aged 50 years and older) were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the respondents aged 50 years and older, 809 (27%) had undergone previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> testing; the Philippines (69%), Australia (48%), and Japan (38%) had the highest participation rates, whereas India (1.5%), Malaysia (3%), Indonesia (3%), Pakistan (7.5%), and Brunei (13.7%) had the lowest rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Physician recommendation and knowledge of screening tests were significant predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> test uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In countries with low-test participation, lower perceived access barriers and higher perceived severity were independent predictors of participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Respondents from low-participation countries had the least knowledge of symptoms, risk factors, and tests and reported the lowest physician recommendation rates. "Intent to undergo screening" and "perceived need for screening" was positively correlated in most countries; however, this was offset by financial and access barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Ethnic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may exist in each country that was not addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the participation tests and physician recommendation recalls were self-reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the Asia-Pacific region, considerable differences were evident in the participation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tests, physician recommendations, and knowledge of, attitudes toward, and barriers to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Physician recommendation was the uniform predictor of screening behavior in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Before implementing mass screening programs, improving awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and promoting the physicians' role are necessary to increase the screening participation rates </plain></SENT>
