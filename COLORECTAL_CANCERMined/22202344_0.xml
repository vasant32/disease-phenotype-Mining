<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Second-line IRIS therapy using S-1 and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>-11 was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IRIS therapy reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker levels to a degree greater than that previously achieved with 5-FU hepatic arterial infusion, and diagnostic imaging allowed a judgment of partial response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, diagnostic imaging allowed a judgment of progressive disease and an eminent elevation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> marker levels in one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third-line panitumumab therapy was started </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report herein a successful case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic arterial infusion therapy is one of the treatment methods characterized by a lower incidence of adverse reactions, relatively low cost, and expectation of high anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> efficacy as compared to chemotherapy such as FOLFIRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IRIS therapy does not require a port insertion and pump carrying, and its cost is about half of FOLFIRI therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When used as second-line therapy for unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, non-inferiority of IRIS therapy to FOLFIRI therapy has been demonstrated in a phase II/III clinica (l FIRIS) study </plain></SENT>
