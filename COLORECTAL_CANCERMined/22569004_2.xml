<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As only 20% of KRAS <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) patients respond to cetuximab it is possible that other mutations, constitutively activating the EGFR pathway, are present in the non-responding KRAS WT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> response rate, (ORR) progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with respect to the mutational status of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN expression in mCRC patients treated with a cetuximab-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 67 mCRC patients were enrolled onto the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded sections derived from primary or metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exon 2 of KRAS and exon 15 of BRAF were analyzed by direct sequencing, PIK3CA was evaluated by pyrosequencing and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were independently associated with worse PFS (p = 0.006 and p = 0.028, respectively) and OS (p = 0.008 and p = 0.029, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences in clinical outcome were found between patients who were positive or negative for PTEN expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients negative for KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were characterized by significantly better ORR, PFS and OS than patients with at least one of these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BRAF and PIK3CA mutations would seem to be independent predictors of anti-EGFR therapy effectiveness and could be taken into consideration during treatment decision making </plain></SENT>
