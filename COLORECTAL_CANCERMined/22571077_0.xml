<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of laparoscopically assisted and open surgery for nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2006 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with nonmetastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon and rectum were considered for inclusion in this prospective non-randomised trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall survival, disease free survival and recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 365 resections were performed for nonmetastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> of the colon and rectum during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those resections, 220 were colonic and 145 were rectal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> 119 (54.1%) were operated laparoscopically and 101 (45.9%) by open surgery, in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> 75 (51.7%) were treated by laparoscopy and 70 (48.3%) by open technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found between the laparoscopic and open group regarding 5-year overall survival (p = 0.17 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, p = 0.60 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>), 5-year disease free survival (p = 0.25 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, p = 0.81 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) and overall recurrence (p = 0.78 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, p = 0.79 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> the probability of 5-year disease free survival was significantly higher in the laparoscopic group in stage III (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is an oncologically safe procedure that is associated with a survival and recurrence rate equal to open surgery </plain></SENT>
