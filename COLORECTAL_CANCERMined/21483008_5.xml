<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Decision making in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> is increasingly complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a decision aid (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) for patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who are considering first-line chemotherapy and reviewing treatment options, prognostic information, and toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined its impact on patient understanding, treatment decisions, decisional conflict, decision making, consultation satisfaction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and quality of life by using a randomized trial design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 207 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> who were considering first-line chemotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> were randomly assigned to receive a standard medical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> consultation or a consultation in which the <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> (take-home booklet with audio recording, reviewed by an oncologist) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants completed questionnaires postconsultation, postdecision, and 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, 100 patients were randomly assigned to the control arm, and 107 received the <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age of the sample was 62 years, 58% were male, 89% had a performance status of 0 or 1, and 36% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving the <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> demonstrated a greater increase in understanding of prognosis, options, and benefits, with higher overall understanding (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decisional conflict, treatment decisions, and achievement of involvement preferences were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> was similar across groups and decreased over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most patients were confident in a decision during the first consultation; 74% chose chemotherapy, 7% supportive care alone, and 10% observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This randomized trial of a decision aid in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> showed that its use in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> improved patient understanding of prognosis, treatment options, risks, and benefits without increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DAs</z:mp> can improve informed consent and can be tested through randomized trials even in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> setting </plain></SENT>
