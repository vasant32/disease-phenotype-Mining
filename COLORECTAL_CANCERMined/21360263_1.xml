<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Phospholipase C-γl (PLC-γl) is known to play a critical role in cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration and is highly expressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we found that cells transformed by PLC overexpression (PLC-γl cells) exhibited a marked decrease in expression of the Epo receptor (EpoR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed the role of EpoR-dependent signaling pathways in PLC-γl-dependent regulation of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression and phosphorylation of EpoR and its functional role in PLC-γl cells were evaluated by immunoblot analysis or cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for PLC-γ1-induced EpoR downregulation was analyzed by blockage of proteosomal degradation with MG132 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EpoR expression was also confirmed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues in which PLC-γl was highly expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EpoR was present on rat fibroblasts, where it functionally active and capable of increasing cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migratory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, PLC-γl cells significantly decreased the Epo-dependent effects via ubiquitination-proteosomal degradation of EpoR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A marked decrease of EpoR expression was confirmed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues that showed high-level of PLC-γl expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Epo/EpoR complex plays a critical role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and migration of rat fibroblasts, and its functional inactivation is associated with PLC-γl-dependent reduction of cell-matrix <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and this also affects cell migration </plain></SENT>
