<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This article analyzes patients with PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) uneligible for debulking and hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy, describing patient- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-related factors possibly affecting survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2009, 43 patients presented with unresectable PC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>: male/female ratio was 29/14, median age was 57.1 years (range 34.8-76.8). "Unresectability" was defined as: six to seven abdominal regions affected by PC, involvement of mesentery or small bowel in the PC, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e>, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, vascular invasion, and/or neural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median time interval between diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and diagnosis of PC was 7.2 months (range 0.0-102.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Primary tumors</z:e> were right-sided in &gt;50% and had been previously resected in &gt;58%, 74.4% of PC occurred synchronously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>Ascites</z:hpo> was present at primary diagnosis in 37.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 70% of cases, six to seven abdominal regions were affected and in 58.1% PC involved small bowel/mesentery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Systemic disease</z:e> was present in 16.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 18.6% of patients, a palliative diversion or ostomy was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 6.3 months (range 0.4-33.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (72.1%) received palliative chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median OS was 9.3 months (range 0.9-33.1) with versus 3.1 months (range 0.4-6.5) without chemotherapy (P = 0.000), with less favorable patient and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No other factors clearly influenced OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Palliative chemotherapy results in better OS, but this is probably attributable to factors influencing the patient's general condition </plain></SENT>
