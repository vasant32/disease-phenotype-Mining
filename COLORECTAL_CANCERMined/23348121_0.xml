<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The expression and distribution of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> (CAN) is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated FXR expression in neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) patients, with or without primary sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> (PSC), as well as the role of DNA methylation in FXR expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples from the right (RC) and left (LC) colon of patients with UC, with and without PSC, and with or without CAN, were stained by immunohistochemistry and scored semiquantitatively for nuclear FXR expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FXR expression was analyzed by western blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nine different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines before and after demethylation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2038">5-azacytidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nondysplastic samples, FXR expression demonstrated a diminishing expression from proximal to distal colon (strong FXR expression: 39% RC samples vs. 14% LC samples; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With moderate-to-severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, FXR expression was almost always absent or weak in both UC and PSC-UC, regardless of location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With quiescent/mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, 56% of UC samples in the RC retained strong FXR expression versus 24% of PSC-UC samples (P= 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FXR was absent in 72% of the neoplastic samples, with an inverse association with the grade of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FXR expression was absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, in some cases due to DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FXR expression is inversely correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic progression</z:e> and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with PSC-UC have diminished FXR expression in the proximal colon compared to UC patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding could contribute to the higher risk of proximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> in PSC patients </plain></SENT>
