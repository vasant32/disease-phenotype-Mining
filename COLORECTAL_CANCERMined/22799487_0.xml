<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Large deletions in APC are a common cause of FAP; despite the existence of a variety of gene dosage detection methodologies, most are labor intensive and time and resource consuming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a new duplex qPCR method for gene dosage analysis based on the coamplification of a target and a reference gene in a SYBR Green reaction, followed by a comparison of the ratio between the target and the reference peaks of the melting curve for the test (patient) and control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reliability of the described duplex qPCR was validated for several genes (APC, HPRT1, ATM, PTEN and BRCA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using this novel gene dosage method, we have identified an APC gene deletion in a FAP patient undergoing genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization based on microarrays (aCGH) was used to confirm and map the extent of the deletion, revealing a 5.2 MB rearrangement (5q21.3-q22.3) encompassing the entire APC and 19 additional genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The novel assay accurately detected losses and gains of one copy of the target sequences, representing a reliable and flexible alternative to other gene dosage techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we described a FAP patient harboring a gross deletion at 5q21.3-q22.3 with an unusual phenotype of the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> and dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
