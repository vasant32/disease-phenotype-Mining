<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies investigating the associations between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) risk in Chinese population have reported controversial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, a meta-analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four hundred and seven relevant records were identified through a literature search up to September 7, 2011, and 19 studies were finally included, involving a total of 3,130 CRC cases and 6,423 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses were performed by language and study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the software programs Review Manager (version 5.1.2) and STATA (version 11.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the GSTM1 polymorphism, the null genotype of GSTM1 was not associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in Chinese population (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.97-1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were found for GSTT1 polymorphism (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.29) and the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.93-1.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For subgroup analyses, studies published in English and population-based studies further identified these associations for the three aspects above in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> not risk factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
