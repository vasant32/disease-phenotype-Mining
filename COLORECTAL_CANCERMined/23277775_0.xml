<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Causes of racial disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) screening may extend beyond individual-level characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined how physician density, beyond socioeconomic factors, affected observed racial disadvantages in recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening for blacks and Hispanics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained socioeconomic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening information on adults age â‰¥ 50 years from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1997 to 2008) and information on the number of primary care physicians and gastroenterologists from the American Medical Association Masterfile (1997 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used fixed-effect multivariate logistic regression to model the probability of receiving a fecal occult blood test within the past year or endoscopic screening within the past 5 years as a function of individual-level socioeconomic factors and state-level physician supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2008, 60.6% of whites were current on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening (95% CI, 60.6% to 61.0%) compared with 57.9% of blacks (95% CI, 56.7% to 59.2%) and 42.9% of Hispanics (95% CI, 41.0% to 44.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of socioeconomic variables reversed black-white disparities (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.19) but did not explain disadvantage for Hispanics (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once interaction of race and physician supply was considered, likelihood of recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening became statistically indistinguishable for Hispanics and whites of similar socioeconomic status residing in states with high physician supplies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors and physician supply are key predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment for socioeconomic determinants explained black-white disparities; further adjustment for physician supply explained Hispanic-white disparities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Physician distribution is a potentially remediable contributor to ethnic/racial disparities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether the United States is able to equitably meet future demand for screening may depend on access, physician supply, and organization of the health care system </plain></SENT>
