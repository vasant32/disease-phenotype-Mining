<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), CD133 expression is an independent prognostic marker associated with adverse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD133 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> AC133 allowed isolating stem cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and cancerous tissues, although its use in colon was questioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify differences between AC133 and AC133 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the gene expression profiles of EpCAM/CEA/AC133 and EpCAM/CEA/AC133 cells from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> tissues (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry confirmed these results in a validation set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 68 genes differentially expressed between both populations, including genes of notorious importance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> pathogenesis, and several candidates not previously shown to play a major role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, EGR1 belonged to the most highly expressed genes in AC133 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the validation set, the presence of EGR1 and CD133 correlated (r = 0.625) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since EGR1 regulates Wnt through up-regulation of TCF4, which induces stem cell marker LGR5, the potential association between LGR5, EGR1 and CD133 was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of LGR5 correlated with the presence of EGR1 and CD133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Strong signals for LGR5 were detected throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> invasion fronts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a connection between CD133 and EGR1 and emphasises the importance of the EGR1/TCF4/CD133/LGR5 network in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
