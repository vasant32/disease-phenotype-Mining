<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We contrast screening-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> not detected by screening among participants assigned to flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Screening Trial to determine the reasons for the lack of detection of prevalent lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancers</z:e> detected within 1 year of a screening FSG with abnormal findings were classified as screening detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were categorized, based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stage and years until detection, as either not detectable or prevalent but not detected at the time of screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING/PATIENTS: A total of 77,447 subjects in the multicenter PLCO trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: A total of 977 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were diagnosed with a mean follow-up of 11.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 243 (24.9%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were screening detected, 470 (48.1%) were not detectable at screening, and 264 (27.0%) were considered prevalent but not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among prevalent nondetected lesions, 35.6% (n = 94) were attributed to problems in patient compliance (58 never screened, 34 delayed colonoscopy follow-up, and 2 inadequate bowel preparation), 43.9% (n = 116) were attributable to a limitation in the FSG procedure (97 beyond the reach of the sigmoidoscope and 19 inadequate depth of insertion on FSG), and 20.5% (n = 54) were caused by endoscopist limitation (33 missed on FSG, 21 missed at initial colonoscopy) (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Had colonoscopy instead of FSG been used for screening, an additional 15.6% and as many as 19.0% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> may have been screening-detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: These estimates are reasonable approximations, but biological variability precludes precise determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prevalent nondetected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were more often attributable to problems with patient compliance or limitations in the FSG procedure than to missed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopy instead of FSG could have moderately increased the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> via screening </plain></SENT>
