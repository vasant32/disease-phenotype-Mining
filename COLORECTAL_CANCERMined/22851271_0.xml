<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Medicare expenditures for high-cost diagnostic imaging have risen faster than those for total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> care and have been targeted for potential cost reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine recent and long-term patterns in high-cost diagnostic imaging use among elderly (aged â‰¥65 years) patients with stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified claims within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography, and nuclear medicine scans between January 1994 and December 2009 for patients diagnosed with stage IV breast, colorectal, lung, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012125'>prostate cancer</z:hpo> between January 1995 and December 2006 (N = 100,594 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of these patients imaged and rate of imaging per-patient per-month of survival were calculated for each phase of care in patients diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2006 (N = 55,253 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to estimate trends in imaging use in stage IV patients diagnosed between January 1995 and December 2006, which were compared with trends in imaging use in early-stage (stages I and II) patients with the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types during the same period (N = 192,429 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the stage IV patients diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2006, 95.9% underwent a high-cost diagnostic imaging procedure, with a mean number of 9.79 (SD = 9.77) scans per patient and 1.38 (SD = 1.24) scans per-patient per-month of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the diagnostic phase, 75.3% were scanned again; 34.3% of patients were scanned in the last month of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between January 1995 and December 2006, the proportion of stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients imaged increased (relative increase = 4.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.7% to 5.6%), and the proportion of early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients imaged decreased (relative decrease = -2.5%, 95% CI = -3.2% to -1.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic imaging is used frequently in patients with stage IV disease, and its use increased more rapidly over the decade of study than that in patients with early-stage disease </plain></SENT>
