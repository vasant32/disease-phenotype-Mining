<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Direct-infusion positive and negative ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (DI-ESI(±)-FTICR MS) was applied to analyze the serum metabolites from 52 CRC patients and 52 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metabolites whose inter-group intensities were determined to be statistically significant by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were further identified by a combination of the Human Metabolome Database, accurate mass measurement, isotopic abundance distribution simulation, and tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>), based on the data from DI-ESI(±)-FTICR MS, revealed a remarkable discrimination among early stage patients, late stage patients, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 15 differentially expressed metabolites were identified and categorized into four <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> class demonstrated specific changing trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biomarker panel 1 containing palmitic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>, oleamide, hexadecanedioic acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28842">octadecanoic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53460">eicosatrienoic acid</z:chebi>, LPC(18:2), LPC(20:4), LPC(22:6), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28875">myristic acid</z:chebi> and LPC(16:0) achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.991, a sensitivity of 0.981 and a specificity of 1.000 for differentiating early stage patients from healthy controls, which was better than the carcinoembryonic antigen biomarker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> stages would be necessary in diagnostic biomarker discovery, as well as that attention should be paid to the facile loss of <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> from the [M + Cl](-) form of LPC(16:0) in its tandem mass spectrum </plain></SENT>
