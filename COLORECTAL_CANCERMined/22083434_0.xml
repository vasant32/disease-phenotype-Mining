<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients operated on for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> during 2006-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with abdominal procedures and bowel resection without anastomotic leakage were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolonged POI was defined as no flatus by postoperative day (POD) 6, with or without intolerance to oral intake by POD 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables studied included demographics, prior medical conditions, details of the surgical procedure, and hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 773 patients met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>POI occurred in 15.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was 11 days without POI and 20 days for POI patients (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with POI in the univariate analysis were <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> III-IV (P &lt; 0.005), male sex (P &lt; 0.004), smoking (P &lt; 0.015), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (COPD) (P &lt; 0.002), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> (P &lt; 0.02), and ileostomy (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-3.5]; COPD (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.25-31.0), and ileostomy (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.23-3.07) as risk factors for POI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of POI seems increased in patients with preoperative COPD and patients with an ileostomy, especially in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consideration of these factors could be important for the prevention and treatment of POI </plain></SENT>
