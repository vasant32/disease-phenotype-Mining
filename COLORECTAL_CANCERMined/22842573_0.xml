<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB have recently emerged as anticancer targets, and we have previously shown increased BDNF levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the findings from in vitro experiments suggesting that BDNF/TrkB signaling can protect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells from the antitumor effects of EGFR blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab reduced both cell proliferation and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of BDNF and TrkB in human HT-29 CRC cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of cetuximab on cell proliferation and survival was counteracted by the addition of human recombinant BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the Trk inhibitor K252a synergistically enhanced the effect of cetuximab on cell proliferation, and this effect was blocked by BDNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first evidence that increased BDNF/TrkB signaling might play a role in resistance to EGFR blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is possible that targeting TrkB could potentiate the anticancer effects of anti-EGFR therapy </plain></SENT>
