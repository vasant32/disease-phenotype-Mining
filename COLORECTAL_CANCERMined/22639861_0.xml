<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were drawn from a hospital registry of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those receiving chemotherapy after it was introduced in 1992 were compared with an age and sex matched control group from the preceding period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From an initial 104 patients treated with chemotherapy and 104 matched controls, 26 were excluded because of non-informative immunohistochemistry, leaving 95 in the treated group and 87 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival did not differ significantly among patients with low GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> who did or did not receive chemotherapy and those with high GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> who received chemotherapy (lowest pair-wise p = 0.11) whereas patients with high GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> who did not receive chemotherapy experienced markedly poorer survival than any of the other three groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pair-wise p &lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result was unaffected by GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stage C <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients with low GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> did not benefit from 5-fluourouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy whereas those with high GST <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> did </plain></SENT>
