<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e>, cell migration and cellular transformation and its enhanced expression is almost completely restricted to malignant tissues, thus making AGR2 an interesting target for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the AGR2 molecule comprises human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201-binding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> recognized by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which could be targeted in dendritic cell (DC)-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> immunotherapy against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the sequence of AGR2 for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> that could potentially bind to HLA-A*0201 with the aid of a computer-based program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five candidate <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with different binding scores were synthesized and tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were then assessed for their immunogenicity to elicit specific immune responses mediated by CTLs in vitro by means of enzyme-linked immunospot assays and CTL assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AGR2 was highly expressed in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines, including DK01, DLD1, KM12C, HCT-8 and HT-29 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DCs pulsed with AGR2-P2 (aa 11-19; LLVALSYTL) or AGR2-P4 (aa 127-135; RIMFVDPSL) generated potent CTLs that could lyse T2 cells pulsed with AGR2-P2 or AGR2-P4 and HLA-A0201(+) AGR2-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cell lines in a strong dose-dependent and HLA-A*0201-restricted manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> derived from AGR2 protein may be attractive candidates for DC-based immunotherapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
