<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A high throughput protein biomarker discovery tool has been developed based on multiplexed proximity ligation assays in a homogeneous format in the sense of no washing steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The platform consists of four 24-plex panels profiling 74 putative biomarkers with sub-pm sensitivity each consuming only 1 Î¼l of human plasma sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system uses either matched monoclonal antibody pairs or the more readily available single batches of affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to generate the target specific reagents by covalently linking with unique nucleic acid sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These paired sequences are united by DNA ligation upon simultaneous target binding forming a PCR amplicon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiplex proximity ligation assays thereby converts multiple target analytes into real-time PCR amplicons that are individually quantified using microfluidic high capacity qPCR in nano liter volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assay shows excellent specificity, even in multiplex, by its dual recognition feature, its proximity requirement, and most importantly by using unique sequence specific reporter fragments on both antibody-based probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the potential of this protein detection technology, a pilot biomarker research project was performed using biobanked plasma samples for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> using a multivariate signature </plain></SENT>
