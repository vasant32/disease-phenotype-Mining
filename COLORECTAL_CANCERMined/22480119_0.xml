<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is obvious that the therapeutic results and the social costs are primarily dependent on the precocity of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present paper aims to bring to attention a number of orientations, which may open a new perspective in approaching the genetic and molecular level of these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of these, the value of the molecular screening based on the detection of the APC gene located on the short arm of chromosome 5, a method that allows the selection of the subjects to be subjected to further endoscopic screening is underlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimization of the costs as well as the increased compliance of the subjects to such a method is thus accomplished </plain></SENT>
