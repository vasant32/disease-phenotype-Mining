<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The miRNA-regulating enzymes Dicer and Drosha exhibit aberrant expression in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dicer and Drosha play a crucial role during the angiogenetic process in vitro and, for Dicer, in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the potential role of Dicer and Drosha in predicting response to Bevacizumab-based therapy in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Dicer and Drosha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were analysed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from patients affected by advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treated with or without Bevacizumab-containing regimens (n=116 and n=50, respectively) and from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diverticulosis</z:e> as control group (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The experimental data were obtained using qRT-PCR, analysed comparing Dicer and Drosha expression levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa and then compared to clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> samples from Bevacizumab-treated patients showed a significantly higher Drosha expression (P&lt;.001) versus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa, while Dicer levels did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we found that low Dicer levels predicted a longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P&lt;.0001) and overall survival (OS) (P=.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, low Dicer levels were associated with better response to Bevacizumab-based treatments versus high Dicer levels (1.7% complete responses and 53.4% partial responses versus 0% and 32.7%, respectively; P=.0067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified three independent predictors of improved OS: high performance status (PS) (relative risk (RR) 1.45; P=.011), lower organs involvement (RR 0.79; P=.034) and low Dicer expression (RR 0.71; P=.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Drosha levels were not associated with prognosis and outcome associated with treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In non-Bevacizumab-treated patients, Dicer and Drosha expression did not correlate with outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that low Dicer <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels seem to be independent predictors of favourable outcome and response in patients affected by advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> treated with Bevacizumab-based therapy </plain></SENT>
