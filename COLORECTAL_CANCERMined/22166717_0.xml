<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>THE AIM OF THE STUDY: was to determine the diagnostic value of colonoscopy in case of patients with clinical symptoms suggesting the possibility of colorectal pathology, as well as evaluate the technical aspects and results of colonoscopic polypectomies, considering the efficacy and safety of the above-mentioned procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the course and results of the polypectomies performed during 3638 colonoscopies was undertaken, considering patients with suspicion of colorectal pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete colonoscopy with cecal intubation was performed in 3310 (91%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic polypectomies were performed during 806 (22.1%) examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected in 459 (56.9%) cases, while multiple lesions in 347 (43.1%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of removed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> amounted to 1184 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 882 (74.6%) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> of which 225 (25.5%) were considered as an advanced pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the pathologist detected 4 malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> with features of adenocar-<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In case of 30 examinations, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> coexisted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and were removed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Post-polypectomy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was observed after 15 (1.7%) polypectomies, although only two patients required surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, amongst the 343 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100896'>rectal polyps</z:hpo>, 19 (6%) non-pedunculated lesions were surgically removed (18 of them by means of the trans-anal approach) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The method proved effective and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> were detected and removed in more than 22% of the colonoscopic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In two (0.28%) cases surgical intervention was required, in order to stop post- polypectomy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>'s peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Some of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100896'>rectal polyps</z:hpo> (6%) had to be surgically removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Preoperative endoscopic "clearance" of large bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath>, facilitated the adjustment of the resection margin in subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
