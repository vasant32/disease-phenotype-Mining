<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers (STMs) have been proposed for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), but their detection should be combined to increase accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurement of a serum biomarker panel may improve the diagnostic value of single STM and a multianalyte immunoassay approach can shorten assay time and lower sample consumption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the simultaneous multianalyte immunoassay is useful for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured a panel of five STMs namely, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> antigen (CA) 19-9 and 72-4, cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA) 21-1, and osteopontin, in a selected homogeneous population of 102 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, range 42-75 years) with Dukes B, G1-2, colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (cases) and in a group of 99 age- and sex-matched patients suffering from confirmed benign colorectal diseases (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, 141 (70.1%) men and 60 (29.9%) women were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest sensitivity was 45.1% (osteopontin), while the highest specificity was 90.9% (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy was lower, ranging from 24.9% (CA 19-9) to 67.2% (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CYFRA 21-1 and CA 72-4 had similar sensitivity (35.3% and 31.4%, respectively), but a significantly different specificity (37.4% vs. 89.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of the five markers achieved 74.1% sensitivity and 94.3% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> single STMs show low sensitivity and specificity, while the simultaneous measurement of a panel of STMs may increase the diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the sample volume is limited, the multianalyte immunoassay can be a reliable tool for studying patients undergoing laboratory screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
