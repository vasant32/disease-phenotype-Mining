<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: S-1 was administered orally in two divided doses daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose was assigned according to body surface area (BSA) as follows: BSA &lt;1.25 m(2), 80 mg/day; BSA ≥1.25 to &lt;1.5 m(2), 100 mg/day; and BSA ≥1.5 m(2), 120 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>S-1 was given for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study objects were the rate of completion of treatment as planned at 1 year, the ratio of the actually administered dose to the planned dose at 1 year, and the total number of days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 1 year, the rate of completion of treatment as planned was 77.7 % (42/54 patients), and the ratio of the actually administered dose to the planned dose was 82.9 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean and median total numbers of days of treatment were 209 and 252, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 or higher toxicity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152227" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">watery eyes</z:e>) occurred in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy had acceptable compliance, safety, and efficacy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy is considered a possible standard treatment regimen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
