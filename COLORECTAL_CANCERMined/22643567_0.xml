<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Our objectives were to: (1) compare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening (CRCS) among US born citizens (USBs), naturalized citizens (NACs), and noncitizens (NOCs) and (2) evaluate clinical factors and potential barriers associated with CRCS in these populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Screening-eligible patients were identified from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up-to-date CRCS was defined as a fecal occult blood test within 1 year, a sigmoidoscopy within 5 years, or a colonoscopy within 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using logistic regression, we determined the effects of immigrant status on CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses based on location of residence, health insurance status, and English proficiency were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: A total of 30,434 average-risk adults aged 50 years or older completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 67% of USBs, 61% of NACs, and 46% of NOCs underwent CRCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Advanced age, male sex, high-income earners, nonsmokers, and those who were married or visited their physicians frequently were more likely to receive CRCS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with USBs, both NACs and NOCs showed decreased odds of CRCS (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.06 and odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.88, respectively; P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratified analyses revealed that the associations between immigrants and decreased CRCS were more prominent for those who lived in rural areas, lacked insurance, or were not English proficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: CRCS remains suboptimal, especially in new US immigrants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Improving health care access and mitigating language barriers may minimize this disparity </plain></SENT>
