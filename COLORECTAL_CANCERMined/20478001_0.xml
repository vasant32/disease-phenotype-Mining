<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospective study of 192 patients was carried out over a six-month period in the 13 units of the Greater Manchester and Cheshire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stoma problems were categorized into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, leakage, pancaking, <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, retraction, separation, stenosis, skin problems, parastomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, suboptimal stoma site and need for resiting or refashioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in incidence between units (anonymized) were analysed, and the effect of stoma complications on length of hospital stay and the need for additional community stoma care was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two patients with stomas were included, of which 52 (27.1%) were identified as being problematic (range 0-66.7% between units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant risk factors included stoma type (colostomy) (P &lt; 0.05), short stoma length (P = 0.006), higher BMI (P = 0.043), emergency surgery (P = 0.002) and lack of preoperative site marking (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Problematic stomas were associated with longer hospital stay (P &lt; 0.001) and increased community care (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stoma type, stoma length, body mass index, emergency surgery and lack of preoperative marking were significant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall complication rates compare favourably with other studies </plain></SENT>
