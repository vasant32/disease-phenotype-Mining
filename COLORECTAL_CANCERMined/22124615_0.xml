<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate which glycemic index is more strongly associated with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This cross-sectional study enrolled 2,776 participants in a comprehensive health management program which included measurement of fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c, along with screening colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> were determined by the multivariate regression analysis, which evaluated the interrelationship among different glycemic indices in a hierarchical way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were found in 605 (21.79%) examinees, 68 (2.45%) of whom had high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycemic indices including diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and HbA1c were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> in the univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, HbA1c outperformed the other two markers as an independent risk factor (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.36%) for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, only HbA1c remained independently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumor</z:e> after patients with established diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 132) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also identified age, male gender, and smoking were independent risk factors for colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HbA1c as compared with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is more strongly and independently associated with colorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further research is warranted to elucidate the value of HbA1c in stratifying risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
