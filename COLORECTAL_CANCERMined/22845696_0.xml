<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Aim:  Colonoscopic follow-up after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> resection (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) is recommended to screen for anastomotic recurrence and metachronous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>, though guidelines vary in the timings of the first investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to quantify current practice and yield of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at first colonoscopy in relation to time from original resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Method:  We conducted a retrospective case note study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRCs</z:e> treated with curative intent within our hospital between two time periods: 2001 to 2003; and 2006 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Variables collected were: extent of preoperative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> imaging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> site, procedure, timing and findings of initial colonoscopy, post operative CT findings and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first follow-up colonoscopy findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> formation and recurrence rates were matched with rates of complete preoperative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two year and five year outcomes were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results:  863 patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with curative intent within these two time periods, (518vs 345) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic follow up rates by two years were 32.8% vs 54.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the first cohort 63.5% of patients underwent colonoscopy by 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant volumes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> and resectable recurrences were found before two years within these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier detection of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> was associated with an improved patient outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete preoperative screening of the bowel was not associated with a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> at first postoperative colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion:  Our study demonstrates significant colonoscopic detection rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> within two years of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient outcomes were improved with earlier detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We would therefore suggest an interval of no more than two years between resection and first surveillance colonoscopy. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland </plain></SENT>
