<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on results and adverse effects of screening colonoscopy are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In autumn 2002, colonoscopy was introduced as part of a nationwide <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> screening program in Germany; it was offered to the general population for individuals 55 years of age or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected and analyzed data from this program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective cross-sectional study, collecting results from 2,821,392 screening colonoscopies performed at more than 2100 practices by highly qualified endoscopists in Germany from January 2003 to December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on participation, colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> detection, and complications were collected using standardized documentation forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data generated were centrally processed and evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cumulative participation rate was 17.2% of eligible women and 15.5% of eligible men 55-74 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate (ADR) was 19.4%, with a higher rate in men (25.8% vs 16.7% in women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> were found in 6.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>Carcinomas</z:mp> were detected in 25,893 subjects (0.9%); most were of an early UICC stage (I, 47.3%; II, 22.3%; III, 20.7%; IV, 9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ADRs for gastroenterologists and nongastroenterologists were 25.1% and 22.3%, respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall complication rate was 2.8/1000 colonoscopies, and the rate of serious complications was 0.58/1000 colonoscopies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A nationwide colonoscopy screening program that uses highly qualified endoscopists can detect a significant number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and early-stage <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ADR for gastroenterologists was higher than for nongastroenterologists </plain></SENT>
