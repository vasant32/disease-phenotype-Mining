<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY AIM: Immunohistochemical screening of hMLH1 and hMSH2 gene mutations in patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e>, suspected of having microsatellite instability, as diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2009 in the Surgery Department of the CF Clinical Hospital Cluj-Napoca (prospective non-randomised study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inclusion criteria were <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> pathology finding and also minimum one of the revised Bethesda criteria for genetic testing of microsatellite instability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>110 eligible patients were divided in 2 study groups according to the number of Bethesda criteria met (group A - 1 criteria; group B - 2 or more criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups were statistically compared considering the clinical and pathological parameters specific to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed immunohistochemical staining to determine the expression of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found the differences in age, colorectal family history and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon tumor</z:e> site between the two groups to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical stainings showed lack of hMLH1 gene expresion in 9 patients and of hMSH2 gene in 4 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining can identify patients who need to be genetically tested for mutations of the DNA mismatch repair genes, in order to establish the correct diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
