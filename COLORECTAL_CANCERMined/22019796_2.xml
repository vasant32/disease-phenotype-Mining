<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the sensitivities of a multimarker test for stool DNA (sDNA) and a plasma test for methylated septin 9 (SEPT9) in identifying patients with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed paired stool and plasma samples from 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 22 with large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> from Mayo Clinic archives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stool (n = 46) and plasma (n = 49) samples from age- and sex-matched patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonoscopy results were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sDNA test is an assay for methylated BMP3, NDRG4, vimentin, and TFPI2; mutant KRAS; the Î²-actin gene, and quantity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (by the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8337">porphyrin</z:chebi> method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was performed blindly at Exact Sciences (Madison, Wisconsin); the test for SEPT9 was performed at ARUP Laboratories (Salt Lake City, Utah) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results were considered positive based on the manufacturer's specificity cutoff values of 90% and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sDNA test detected <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> (median, 2 cm; range, 1-5 cm) with 82% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-95%); SEPT9 had 14% sensitivity (95% CI, 3%-35%; P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sDNA test identified patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with 87% sensitivity (95% CI, 69%-96%); SEPT9 had 60% sensitivity (95% CI, 41%-77%; P = .046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sDNA test identified patients with stage I-III <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with 91% sensitivity (95% CI, 71%-99%); SEPT9 had 50% sensitivity (95% CI, 28%-72%; P = .013); for stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, sensitivity values were 75% (95% CI, 35%-97%) and 88% (95% CI, 47%-100%), respectively (P = .56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>False positive rates were 7% for the sDNA test and 27% for SEPT9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on analyses of paired samples, the sDNA test detects nonmetastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> with significantly greater levels of sensitivity than the SEPT9 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings might be used to modify approaches for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> prevention and early detection </plain></SENT>
