<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: As a result of advances in surgical techniques and (neo)adjuvant therapy, mortality rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have declined significantly in the last two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors report good health-related quality of life in survivorship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many survivors, including those who describe their quality of life as good, also report <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> that persist long after treatment is completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: In this article, we review the effects of different treatment modalities for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> on sexual functioning in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We highlight both the physical and psychological aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment and discuss the management of common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the existing available published articles regarding this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our review of the evidence suggests that surgical treatment and (neo)adjuvant therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are commonly associated with a wide range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856619" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning is an important functional outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment and is influenced by a myriad of clinical and patient factors, including an individual's physical and psychological well-being after a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As such, the assessment and management of sexual functioning in men and women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> should begin prior to the initiation of treatment and continue throughout treatment and survivorship </plain></SENT>
