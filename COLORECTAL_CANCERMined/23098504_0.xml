<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to look into <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening participation and its barriers among average risk individuals in Malaysia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main reason for them to undergo screening was being advised by health care providers (84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study showed that participation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening in Malaysia is extremely low and multiple factors contribute to this situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the importance of the disease, efforts should be made to increase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> screening activities in Malaysia </plain></SENT>
