<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Increased expression of tissue factor (TF) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously observed that TF/FVIIa upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) expression at the transcriptional level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMP-7 overexpression is believed to play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which TF/FVIIa induced MMP-7 expression and cell invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, luciferase assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which TF/FVIIa induced MMP-7 expression and cell invasion in LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) and cell invasion assay was used to examine whether blocking c-Fos expression could abolish FVIIa-mediated upregulation of MMP-7 and cell invasion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that FVIIa induced the upregulation of MMP-7 both at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner and increased the invasive behavior of LoVo cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FVIIa enhanced the promoter activity of MMP-7, and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site was responsible for the activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Site mutation of the AP-1 binding site in the promoter almost completely abolished FVIIa-mediated response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ChIP assay confirmed that FVIIa promoted the direct binding of c-Fos with the MMP-7 promoter in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FVIIa also induced the expression and nuclear accumulation of the AP-1 subunit c-Fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Fos eliminated FVIIa-stimulated MMP-7 expression and cell migration in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor (PD98059) and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 suppressed MMP-7 upregulation induced by FVIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a novel TF/FVIIa/MAPK/c-Fos/MMP-7 axis plays an important role in modulating the invasion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells and blockage of this pathway holds promise to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
