<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Consensus guidelines of the American <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Colorectal Cancer</z:e>, and the American College of Radiology recommend first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> before age 60 should be screened every 5 years with colonoscopy starting at age 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the identical recommendation for those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) before age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is good evidence that first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> before age 60 are at substantially increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether an individual with a first-degree relative with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> diagnosed before age 60 is at increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> portend the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in the individual who has the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath>, they would not be expected to portend the same risk in their first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of these uncertainties, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend more aggressive screening of first-degree relatives of individuals with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> detection rate for individuals 50 to 59 years old without a first-degree relative with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is sufficiently high (approximately 25%-30%) that almost half the population would be high risk on the basis of one first-degree relative having an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of evidence supporting the guidelines, suboptimal levels of screening in the general population, and lack of resources to comply with the recommendation, first-degree relatives of individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> should be screened as average-risk persons until more compelling data are available to justify more aggressive screening </plain></SENT>
