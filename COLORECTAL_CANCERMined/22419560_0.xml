<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Understanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients' supportive care needs can help optimize health-care systems and inform services development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the prevalence of supportive care needs in Chinese breast (BC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) patients to identify prevalence and correlates of unmet needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed supportive care needs (Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> (the Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale), symptom distress (The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form), and satisfaction with care (Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire) among 210 Chinese BC (97) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (104) outpatient clinic attendees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> patients (89.7%) reported more unmet needs (χ(2)  = 4.409, p = 0.027), but both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and BC samples ranked unmet needs prevalence similarly, with health system and information needs reported as the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Younger patients reported higher health system and information and sexuality needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the strength of unmet needs did not differ by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unmet psychological, physical and daily living, and sexuality needs were positively associated with greater symptom distress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater health system information needs were associated with high global distress and low <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, whereas greater psychological needs were associated with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hong Kong Chinese BC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients strongly prioritized needs related to health systems and information provision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> were associated with unmet needs, reflecting a service shortfall in symptom management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improving care provision by optimizing communication and clinic organization can better prepare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients for their rehabilitation and improve symptom control </plain></SENT>
