<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients with five or less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No limitations concerning dimension or localization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> were imposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy, delivering a total dose of 40 Gy in fractions of 4 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was carried out at baseline and 3 months after the initiation of radiotherapy to evaluate the metabolic response rate according to PET Response Criteria in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Solid Tumors</z:e> (PERCIST) version 1.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side-effects were scored using National <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC AE) version 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 52 metastases were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient (4%) experienced grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>; two patients (9%) grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were evaluated by post-treatment PET-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five (23%) and seven patients (32%) achieved a complete and partial metabolic response, respectively, resulting in an overall metabolic response rate of 55% </plain></SENT>
