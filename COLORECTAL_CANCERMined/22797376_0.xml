<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tools currently available to risk-stratify patients are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the prognostic utility of metabolic measurements derived from(18)F-FDG PET compared with previously proposed prognostic scoring systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Preoperative (18)F-FDG PET/CT studies from a series of 30 patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative (18)F-FDG PET analysis calculated the maximum and mean standardized uptake value, metabolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume (MTV), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> glycolytic volume (TGV) as measures of the metabolic activity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predictive value of these parameters was compared with that of 4 prognostic scores developed by Fong, Iwatsuki, Nordlinger, and Rees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High MTV and TGV in patients before metastasectomy were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (MTV: P = 0.001; TGV: P = 0.004) and recurrence-free survival (MTV: P = 0.001, TGV; P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum and mean standardized uptake value did not show any significant predictive ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the prognostic scores, prediction of outcome was most accurate using the Basingstoke index (area under the curve, 0.898) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Assessment of metabolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden with volumetric (18)F-FDG PET parameters appears to be a valuable adjunct in determining the biology of CRLM before surgical resection and may enable better risk stratification of patients </plain></SENT>
