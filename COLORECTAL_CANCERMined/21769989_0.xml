<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the effectiveness of a volunteer-delivered tailored telephone-based intervention in reducing prevalence of unmet supportive care needs, elevated levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> among people with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> over a 9-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 653 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire and were randomised to usual care (n = 341) or intervention (n = 306) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three follow-up questionnaires were completed at 3-monthly intervals (response rates: 93%, 87%, 82%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four questionnaires contained the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS), Hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale (HADS) and checklists for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> symptoms and use of support services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intervention consisted of trained volunteers providing emotional support, service referral and information and was delivered after completion of each of the first three questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were prevalence of moderate to high SCNS needs and elevated levels (scores of 8+) of HADS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the study period, SCNS needs decreased similarly for both groups, and prevalence of elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> did not change for either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a greater reduction in the prevalence of elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> in the intervention than usual care group (p &lt; 0.01), with the intervention group decrease mainly occurring between baseline and the first follow-up survey (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> was similar between the two groups at each follow-up point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The intervention had no effect on supportive care needs or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, although it may be associated with a greater reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future research should test the intervention with patients closer to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
