<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biliary stenting is the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, which patients benefit most is not well-defined, yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to delineate the clinical factors affecting prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Charts of 140 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877373" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">advanced cancer</z:e> who underwent biliary stenting were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 63.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 73 (52.1 %) were male, 32 (22.9 %) had ECOG PS 1 and 81 (57.9 %) had PS 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types were cholangiocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> (64, 45.7 %) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002894'>pancreatic cancer</z:hpo> (36, 25.7 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 141 (95 % CI, 100.7-185.3) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female patients lived longer (161.0 vs. 124.0 days) (p = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> lived the longest (667.0 days), followed by cholangiocellular (211.0 days), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>gastric cancers</z:hpo> (106.0 days) (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The distribution of primary diagnosis differed significantly between sexes: cholangiocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was present in 22 (30.1 %) out of 73 men and 42(62.7 %) out of 67 women (chi-square p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for longer overall survival if ALT (p = 0.08) and AST (p = 0.06) were normalized after stent insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 137 patients, 63 (45.5 %) did not experience any complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 74 patients with complications, there were 39 (28.5 %) episodes of cholangitic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and 35 (25.5 %) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0400979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">biliary obstructions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In three patients, we could not find data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, hence the natural biology and the therapeutic expectations are probably the most important factors which must be considered during decision-making </plain></SENT>
