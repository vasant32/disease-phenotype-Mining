<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a method for differentiating prevalence into the proportions expected to survive without relapse, die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within a year, and die of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> within 10 years or survive with relapse at the end of the 10th year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The method was applied to samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> cases, randomly extracted from four Italian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registries (CRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CRs collected data on treatments, local relapses, distant relapses, and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: 1) over the entire follow-up to 31 December 2007 for 601 cases diagnosed in 2002 (cohort approach); 2) over a single year (2007) for five cohorts of cases defined by year of diagnosis (from 1997 to 2001), alive at 1 January 2007 (total 298 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cohorts were combined into a fictitious cohort with 10 years survival experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For each year j after diagnosis the health status of cases alive at the beginning of j was estimated at the end of the 10th year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these estimates the 10-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> prevalence was differentiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We estimated: 74.7% alive without relapse or not undergoing treatment at the end of 10 years; 8.1% had died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> within a year; 11.4% had died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> 1-10 years after diagnosis or had relapsed or were undergoing treatment at the end of the 10th year; and 5.8% had died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced a new method for estimating the healthcare and rehabilitation demands of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survivors based on CR data plus treatment and relapse data specifically collected for samples of cases archived by CRs </plain></SENT>
