<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> that are involved in different biological processes by suppressing target gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of miR-30a-5p has been reported in colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate its potential biological role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, miR-30a-5p was overexpressed via a lentiviral vector system in two different <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This induced in both lines miR-30a-5p-mediated growth inhibition, attributable to a cell cycle arrest at the G(1) phase and an induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Combining global gene expression analyses of miR-30a-5p transgenic line HCT116 with in silico miRNA target prediction, we identified the denticleless protein homolog (DTL) as a potential miRNA-30a-5p target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent reporter gene assays confirmed the predicted miR-30a-5p binding site in the 3'untranslated region of DTL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, overexpression of DTL in HCT116 cells partially rescued these cells from miR-30a-5p-mediated growth suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, TP53 and CDKN1A expression were increased in miR-30a-5p-overexpressing HCT116 cells, suggesting that miR-30a-5p is able to modulate the cell cycle via a DTL-TP53-CDKN1A regulatory circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, 379 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues were screened for DTL expression and DTL was found to be overexpressed in 95.8% of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data identified miR-30a-5p as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-suppressing miRNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells exerting its function via modulation of DTL expression, which is frequently overexpressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest that restoring miR-30a-5p function may prove useful as therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with reduced miR-30a-5p expression </plain></SENT>
