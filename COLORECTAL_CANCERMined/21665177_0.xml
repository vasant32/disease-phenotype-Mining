<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations are associated with 16% to 50% of isolated villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and approximately 30% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation between the gross and histological subset of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with KRAS mutation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Archived surgical resection specimens of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> (n = 42) and villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> (n = 9) were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gross appearance and histopathological features of these lesions were thoroughly reviewed, including the presence of a pre-existing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections and then subjected to TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the seven most common KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KRAS mutations were found in 13 of 42 cases (31%) of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and 7 of 9 cases (78%) of villous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 cases of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> with a KRAS mutation showed a gross polypoid configuration, compared to no KRAS mutation in the colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> with ulcerative configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 13 of 17 of these cases (76%) had histological features of <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> with a persistent preexisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> with villous architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, grossly polypoid colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinomas</z:mp> with a persistent pre-existing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_490'>adenomatous polyp</z:mpath> with villous architecture are strongly associated with KRAS mutations </plain></SENT>
