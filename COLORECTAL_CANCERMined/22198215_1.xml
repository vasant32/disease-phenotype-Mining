<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="20551">5-aminosalicylate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi>) is discussed as a chemopreventive agent as it reduces the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study analyses the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> on Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo in colon epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was determined using a β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)-reporter assay and by western blotting in cultured <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formalin fixed paraffin embedded material from 227 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyps</z:mpath> removed from a subgroup of 56 patients, who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled 3-year prevention trial with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> was evaluated according to histomorphological characteristics and expression of β-catenin and target genes Cox2, cyclin D1 and E-cadherin as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped into a low-risk and a high-risk group according to the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> at initial colonoscopy. ß-catenin/TCF signaling activity was significantly reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> treatment possibly through a reduction in ß-catenin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> significantly reduced ß-catenin levels and nuclear localization in patients' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> also significantly changed expression of the downstream targets Cox2, cyclin D1 and E-cadherin, correlating with ß-catenin status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> significantly reduced levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of p53 was unaltered by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study shows a significant in vitro and long-term in vivo effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> on ß-catenin signaling as a key signaling pathway in the development of colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-ASA</z:chebi> as a promising drug for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
