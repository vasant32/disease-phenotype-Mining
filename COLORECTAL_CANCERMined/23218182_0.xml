<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wider adoption of specific aspects of westernized lifestyles would translate to still greater increases in certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In many countries the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and other non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> will add to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">communicable diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> to impose a "double burden" on the poorest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These trends represent major challenges to health, poverty, sustainable development and equality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevention is, however, possible based on implementing existing knowledge about risk factors and the natural history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both primary and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> prevention offer therefore many opportunities to combat the projected increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tobacco control, reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and physical inactivity, reduced consumption of alcohol, vaccination against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B and human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> viruses, safe sex, avoidance of environmental and occupational carcinogens and excessive sun exposure as well as the early detection and screening for breast, cervix and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> would <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> make significant contributions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time, for a number of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (e.g., colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, brain, lympho-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haematological malignancies</z:e>) research is needed to identify as yet unknown risk factors whilst for existing prevention strategies additional work is needed on their implementation into health services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, there is a remarkable opportunity for advances in understanding the molecular basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> to provide new tools and insights into aetiology and prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is only by complementing efforts to improve treatment with those aimed at prevention that the impending epidemic of this disease can be addressed </plain></SENT>
