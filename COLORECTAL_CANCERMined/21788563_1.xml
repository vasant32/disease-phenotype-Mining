<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, obtaining personal and familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> data can sometimes be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Microsatellite Path Score (MsPath), a pathological score, based on age, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location, and pathologic features, has been developed to effectively predict <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the MsPath model's performance in an unselected, population-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) population is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> regardless of age, personal or family history, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> characteristics from the EPICOLON study, an independent, prospective, multicenter, population-based cohort (N = 1,222) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis and immunostaining for MLH1/MSH2, and those with MMR underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> BRAF mutation analysis and MLH1/MSH2 germline testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the pathologic features were centralized and evaluated blinded to the MMR status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MsPath score for prediction of having MSI high, with the recommended MsPath cutoff score â‰¥1.0, had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of 92.8% (95% CI, 86.9 to 98.3), 64.1% (95% CI, 61.1 to 66.8), and 15.8% (95% CI, 12.2 to 18.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MsPath score had a sensitivity, specificity, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of 81.8% (95% CI, 59.0 to 99.8), 60.6% (95% CI, 57.8 to 63.4), and 1.9% (95% CI, 0.7 to 3.1), respectively, for the identification of MLH1/MSH2 gene carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Application of the MsPath score, resulted in two (18%) of 11 mutation carriers being missed, both pathogenic germline MSH2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the general nonselected population, the MsPath score accurately predicted the probability of bearing a MSI high <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, but it was insufficiently accurate to use for the selection of patients warranting MLH1/MSH2 mutation testing in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
