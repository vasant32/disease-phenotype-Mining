<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>914 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study (352 &gt; 75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the elderly group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were predominantly right sided, and the overall number of comorbidities was statistical more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients underwent emergency surgery more than the control group (p = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of curative and palliative resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall operative mortality rate was 5.9% in the study group compared with 2.1% in the control study (p = 0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall 3-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates were, respectively, 37, 16.2 and 5.1% in the study group, when compared with 52.3, 35.1 and 24.7% in the control group (p = 0.022, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
