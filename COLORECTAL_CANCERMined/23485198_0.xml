<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess their utility in prediction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-specific survival (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>136 patients undergoing curative surgery for colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were taken from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free intestinal mucosa and ELISA was used to assess protein levels in the tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included patients was 65 months (range: 45-92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was CSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T stage, lymph node involvement and high levels of MMP-1 as well as MMP-9 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free mucosa tissue were significantly associated with CSS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This prognostic strength was maintained for MMP-1 and N-status in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that MMP-1 is independently associated with CSS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a possible clinical implication is that MMP-1 protein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-free mucosa could identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> patients with poor CSS in need of more intensified adjuvant treatment </plain></SENT>
