<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) as well as to investigate the relationship between the cellular pH and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells.To pursue our aims, we conducted investigations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DHD</z:e>/K12/Trb rat <z:mp ids='MP_0009314'>colon adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracellular pH was measured by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) using the lysosensor Green DND-189 probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of crucial molecules in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was analyzed by CLSM, western blot, and real time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of activation (phosphorylation state) of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38MAPKinase were performed by Reverse-Phase Protein Microarray Analysis (RPMA).We showed that ANP triggered a NHE-1-mediated increase of the intracellular acidity, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed that the Wnt1a, a Wnt signaling activator, affected the intracellular pH in an opposite fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from the comparative analysis of ANP and EIPA (a NHE-1 specific inhibitor) showed that these two molecules affect both the intracellular acidification and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, ANP acts on the upstream of the cascade, through a Frizzled-mediated activation, while EIPA does on the downstream.We show for the first time that the Akt activity might be a relevant molecular event linking the NHE-1-regulated intracellular pH and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This provides evidence for a cross-talk between the intracellular alkalinization and the Wnt signaling in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
