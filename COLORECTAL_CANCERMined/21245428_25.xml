<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The prognosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> has sometimes proved uncertain; thus, the prognostic significance of immune criteria was compared with that of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension criteria using the American Joint Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>/International Union Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e>-TNM (AJCC/UICC-TNM) staging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the intratumoral immune infiltrates in the center of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and in the invasive margin of 599 specimens of stage I to IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> from two independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed these findings in relation to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension and to the frequency of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Growth of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> and metastatic spread were associated with decreased intratumoral immune T-cell densities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of patients with high densities of CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltrate presented with stage Tis/T1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, whereas no patients with low densities presented with such early-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who did not relapse, the density of CD8 infiltrates was inversely correlated with T stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurred, the number of CD8 cells was low regardless of the T stage of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that the immune score was significantly associated with differences in disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64, 0.60, and 0.70, respectively; P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis illustrated the predictive accuracy of the immune parameters (c-index = 65.3%, time-dependent c-index [Cτ] = 66.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A final stepwise model for Cox multivariate analysis supports the advantage of the immune score (HR, 0.64; P &lt; .001; Cτ = 67.9%) compared with histopathologic features in predicting recurrence as well as survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Assessment of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes in combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> regions provides an indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurrence beyond that predicted by AJCC/UICC-TNM staging </plain></SENT>
