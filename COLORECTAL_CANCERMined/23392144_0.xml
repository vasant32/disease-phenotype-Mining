<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients seen in most surgical clinics have limited or no family histories documented and are rarely assessed for hereditary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2007 a clinic-based hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registry was established to screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and facilitate genetic counseling/testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registry to identify high-risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients and have them referred for genetic counseling/testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective review and cohort comparison of both prospectively collected and retrospective data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The colorectal surgical clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> newly diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients seen between January 2006 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To assess the identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> and for the occurrence of genetic counseling/testing before and after the establishment of a hereditary registry by comparing the results from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients seen the year prior to the establishment of the registry (January - December 2006, "control period") with those patients seen after initiation of the registry (January 2007 - October 2010, "registry period") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the "registry period," 495 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were seen in the clinic and 257 (51.9%) were high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients (9.8%) underwent genetic testing, with 27 (5.4%) positive for a gene mutation, of which half were &gt;50 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By comparison, in 2006, 115 colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients were seen in the clinic but only 4 patients (3.5%) went on for further assessment, and only 1 had genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retrospective assessment showed that at least 22 patients (19.1%) had warranted further investigation in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: This was a single-institution, retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Establishment of a hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> registry with a clinic-based protocol improves identification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
