<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> metallothionein 1 + 2 isoforms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> has demonstrated an important down-regulation compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, although its prognostic significance is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the contribution of individual isoforms to overall metallothionein down-regulation is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address these important issues, we analyzed the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> expression levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> functional metallothionein 1 + 2 isoforms by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 22 pairs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-microdissected epithelia and correlated these to the overall immunohistochemical protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that 5 isoforms (MT1G, 1E, 1F, 1H, and 1M) were lost during the transition from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, whereas MT1X and MT2A were less down-regulated, and their expression was correlated with overall protein positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, we showed that MT1G hypermethylation occurred in cell lines and in 29% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitors are able to induce most isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we analyzed by immunohistochemistry 107 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosae, 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath>, 81 <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp>, and 19 lymph node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> to evaluate metallothionein expression during different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> development and to assess its relationship to patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A lower immunohistochemical expression was associated with poorer survival, although it was not an independent predictor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study identifies for the first time the relevant metallothionein isoforms for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> progression, supports the concept that their loss is associated with worse prognosis, and suggests 2 mechanisms for epigenetic repression of metallothionein expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009404" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
