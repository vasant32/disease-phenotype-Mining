<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hereby present four cases of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> along with a literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of four cases from our institute was conducted, and 15 articles from PubMed describing childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Case reports: Four patients ranging in age from 11 to 14 years were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> between the years 2000 and 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms varied and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>hematochezia</z:hpo>, with symptom duration ranging from a few days to 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient had a predisposing disease or syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgical resections, with the most prevalent histology being mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite radical surgery followed by systemic chemotherapy, the disease progressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Literature review: A total of 239 cases were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The youngest patient was 6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent predisposing conditions were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032580" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">familial adenomatous polyposis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients presented advanced stage, with the most common histopathologic diagnosis being mucinous <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>, followed by poorly differentiated <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> and signet ring cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Even though most of the patients underwent aggressive treatment, the overall prognosis was poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> has an aggressive pathology and distinct genetic features, which result in an advanced stage at diagnosis and consequently a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence is very low, every physician should be aware of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> as a possible childhood diagnosis </plain></SENT>
