<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare stent placement as a bridge to surgery vs. emergency surgical resection in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> obstruction using P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, the physiological and operative scores, morbidity and mortality predicted by the P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores were collected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients with LCCO who underwent surgical resection directly (Group A) or after stent placement (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were enrolled (Group A-41 and Group B-45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed 30-day mortality rate was 9.8% (4/41) in Group A and 2.4% (1/45) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-day morbidity rate was 61% (25/41) in Group A and 29% (13/45) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values of P-POSSUM morbidity (A=70.5% vs. B=34.3%; p=0.001), P-POSSUM mortality (A=13.6% vs. B=2.4%; p=0.001) and CR-POSSUM mortality (A=15.1% vs. B=4.9%; p=0.001) were significantly lower in the Group B patients than in the Group A patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bridge to surgery strategy reduces the surgical risks in LCCO, and P-POSSUM and CR-POSSUM scores represent a good tool for comparing the two strategies </plain></SENT>
