<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> location on the association of EGFR with the conventional prognostic indicators (stage and grade) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical assessment of EGFR was retrospectively performed in 119 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> specimens and data were correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> stage and grade in the proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular combination of EGFR with p53 (previously assessed in this sample) was similarly analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGFR positivity was detected in 34, 30 and 35% of the entire cohort, proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of EGFR clinicopathological correlation was found to differ by site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the frequency of EGFR(+) with progression of stage and/or worsening of grade was observed proximally, whereas an opposite trend was recorded distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with stage I or with indolent features (stage I, well-differentiated) exhibited a significantly higher proportion of EGFR positivity than other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of this location (p=0.023 and p=0.022, respectively) or corresponding distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (p=0.018 and p=0.035, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the co-existence of EGFR and high p53 staining (accounting for 11% of cases) was found in a significantly higher proportion of stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> compared to other stages (p=0.004), although only for the distal subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proximal and distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> showed various patterns of EGFR variation with disease progression and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressiveness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This disparity provides further support to the hypothesis that these particular subsets of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> are distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may also be suggestive of a potentially different therapeutic approach according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> site, particularly regarding anti-EGFR targeted treatment </plain></SENT>
