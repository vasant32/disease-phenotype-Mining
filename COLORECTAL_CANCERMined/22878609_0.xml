<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">Aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) has been described as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> stem cell marker and as a regulator of cellular chemoresistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, ALDH1A1 has been suggested as potential biomarker to stratify patients into different risk categories for a "personalized" therapy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the prognostic role of ALDH1A1 in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> and its value in predicting response to chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunostaining against ALDH1A1 was performed on a paraffin-embedded tissue microarray including 659 primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> samples and 338 rectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, tissue of 44 palliatively resected colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> on whole-mount tissue slides was immunostained against ALDH1A1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic, nuclear, and stromal expression of ALDH1A1 was assessed and merged with histopathological and clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that cytoplasmic and stromal expression of ALDH1A1 is not significantly associated with prognosis either in colon or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytoplasmic expression of ALDH1A1 does not predict response to palliative chemotherapy in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, as a novel finding, nuclear expression of ALDH1A1 was observed in a small subgroup of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, nuclear expression was significantly associated with shortened overall survival by univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical expression analysis of ALDH1A1 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo> is useful for the detection of nuclear expression in a small subpopulation of patients and is associated with shorter survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic expression fails to be of clinical relevance as prognostic or predictive marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
