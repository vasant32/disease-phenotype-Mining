<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1, a bifunctional guidance cue, binds to deleted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53090">DCC</z:chebi>) and DSCAM mediating axon attraction, and UNC5 mediating axon repulsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that DSCAM interacts with UNC5C and this interaction is stimulated by netrin-1 in primary cortical neurons and postnatal cerebellar granule cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DSCAM partially co-localized with UNC5C in primary neurons and brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 induces axon growth cone collapse of mouse cerebellum external granule layer (EGL) cells, and the knockdown of DSCAM or UNC5C by specific shRNAs or blocking their signaling by overexpressing dominant negative mutants suppresses netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the simultaneous knockdown of DSCAM and UNC5C also blocks netrin-1-induced growth cone collapse in EGL cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Netrin-1 increases tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous DSCAM, UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1, and promotes complex formation of DSCAM with these signaling molecules in primary postnatal cerebellar neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Src family kinases efficiently reduces the interaction of DSCAM with UNC5C, FAK, Fyn, and PAK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins as well as growth cone collapse of mouse EGL cells induced by netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The knockdown of DSCAM inhibits netrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of UNC5C and Fyn as well as the interaction of UNC5C with Fyn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The double knockdown of both receptors abolishes the induction of Fyn tyrosine phosphorylation by netrin-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study reveals the first evidence that DSCAM coordinates with UNC5C in netrin-1 repulsion </plain></SENT>
