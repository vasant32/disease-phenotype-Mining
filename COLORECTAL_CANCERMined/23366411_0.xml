<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is partly because it takes a long time to prepare samples and the operation can be complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To resolve these problems, we developed a new automatic cell isolation system which consists of cell isolation unit and staining reagent kit specialized for flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this new system, cell isolation can be done more rapidly and easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using this method, we could determine optimum condition to disintegrate porcine colon tissue and stain cells stably in 6 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that our method can provide analysis data within 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated our method in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients, and the result was promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the data suggests that this method can support and facilitate rapid diagnosis </plain></SENT>
