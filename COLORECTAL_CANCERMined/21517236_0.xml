<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Studies of the association between the cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A genetic polymorphism and risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) have generated conflicting results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to derive a more precise estimation, a meta-analysis was here performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive search of relevant studies was carried out as a meta-analysis of twenty studies with 5,975 cases and 8,333 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, a significantly elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> risk was associated with variant allele 870A when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies were pooled (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.04-1.44; GA vs. GG: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.26; dominant model: OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.03-1.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were detected among Caucasians (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.04-1.44; and dominant model: OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.02-1.34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With stratification into <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1333990" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</z:e> (HNPCC), the former demonstrated increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> susceptibility (AA vs. GG: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.04-1.48; dominant model: OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.04-1.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant associations were found in either Asians or HNPCC patients for any genetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the cyclin D1 870A allele is a low-penetrant risk factor for development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e>, especially among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
