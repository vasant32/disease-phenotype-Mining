<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations of selected micronutrients with risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in study participants from Newfoundland, Labrador (NL) and Ontario (ON), Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based study among 1760 case participants and 2481 age- and sex-matched control participants </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highest compared to lowest quartile intakes of certain micronutrients were associated with lower risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, including: calcium (from food and supplements (FS), OR=0.59; 95% CI=0.45-0.77, and from food only (FO): OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.59-0.97), <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> (FS:OR=0.67; 95%CI:0.51-0.88), <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> (FS: OR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.57-0.94, FO: OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.62-1.00), <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> (FS: OR=0.61; 95% CI=0.47-0.78, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> (FS: OR=0.72; 95% CI=0.56-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was observed for iron intake (highest versus lowest quintiles: OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.01-1.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study presents evidence that dietary intake of calcium, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="12" ids="17015">riboflavin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> are associated with a lower risk of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and that dietary intake of iron may be associated with a higher risk of the disease </plain></SENT>
