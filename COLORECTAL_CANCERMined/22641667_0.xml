<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible involvement of claudin-1 (CL-1), which is one of the major tight junctional proteins, was investigated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatic metastasis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> who underwent surgical treatment from January 2007 until December 2010 at the Kurume University Hospital in Fukuoka, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissue specimens were analyzed to determine whether the levels of CL-1 correlated with clinicopathological factors and to determine the roles of CL-1, β-catenin, and E-cadherin in the alterations of the tight junctions during <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In seven cases, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were located in the colon, while the other seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were found in the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were eight cases of synchronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e>, while there were six cases of metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of the CL-1 protein were up-regulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and in hepatic metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of β-catenin were positive or up-regulated in the primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lesions and in hepatic metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the finding that the levels of E-cadherin were decreased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, they were clearly up-regulated in hepatic metastatic lesions in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CL-1 levels were up-regulated in liver metastatic lesions from primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the levels of E-cadherin were increased in liver metastatic lesions, which may point to the existence of interactions between CL-1 and E-cadherin in hepatic metastatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that CL-1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and in the behavior of metastatic processes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
