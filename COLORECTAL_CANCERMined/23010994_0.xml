<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine reliable prognostic biomarkers by the analysis of patients with resectable colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> (CRLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from the CRLM tissues of a cohort of 126 patients with CRLM with curative hepatic resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The KRAS/BRAF mutation spectrum and microsatellite instability (MSI) status were successfully analyzed in 100 of the 126 CRLM tissues and these findings were examined in relation to the patients' clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort of 100 CRLM patients consisted of 46 with synchronous and 54 with metachronous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and disease-free survival at 5 years were 57.4 and 24.9 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSI analysis revealed that none of the 100 CRLM specimens showed any evidence of MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By KRAS/BRAF mutation analysis, the analyzed CRLM patients were divided into 3 groups; KRAS-mutant (KRAS-Mt; n = 27), BRAF-mutant (BRAF-Mt; n = 3), and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-types</z:mp> of both genes (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp>; n = 70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the survival analysis, both KRAS-Mt and BRAF-Mt patients showed significantly poorer prognoses compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although the population with the BRAF mutation was small, this mutation had a significant negative impact on disease-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in the cohort of CRLM patients were non-MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, suggesting MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> would rarely reveal metastatic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>KRAS and BRAF mutations are suggested to be poor prognostic factors in CRLM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genetic information has an essential role as a prognostic marker and could contribute to the decisions on treatment strategy for CRLM </plain></SENT>
