<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we studied the associations between beta-catenin overexpression and MSI status with survival from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, and with expression of p21, p27, cyclin D1 and p53, in a large, prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immunohistochemical MSI-screening status and expression of p21, p27 and p53 was assessed in tissue microarrays with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> from 557 cases of incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in the Malm√∂ Diet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chi Square and Spearman's correlation tests were used to explore the associations between beta-catenin expression, MSI status, clinicopathological characteristics and investigative parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to assess the relationship between beta-catenin overexpression, MSI status and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> specific survival (CSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Positive MSI screening status was significantly associated with older age, female sex, proximal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e>, and poor differentiation, and inversely associated with beta-catenin overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin overexpression was significantly associated with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> location, low T-stage and well-differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with MSI <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> had a significantly prolonged CSS in the whole cohort, and in stage III-IV disease, also in multivariable analysis, but not in stage I-II disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin overexpression was associated with a favourable prognosis in the full cohort and in patients with stage III-IV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither MSI nor beta-catenin status were predictive for response to adjuvant chemotherapy in curatively treated stage III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>P53 and p27 expression was positively associated with beta-catenin overexpression and inversely associated with MSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cyclin D1 expression was positively associated with MSI and beta-catenin overexpression, and p21 expression was positively associated with MSI but not beta-catenin overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large, prospective cohort study demonstrate that MSI screening status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> is an independent prognostic factor, but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277565" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">localized disease</z:e>, and does not predict response to adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Beta-catenin overexpression was also associated with favourable outcome but not a treatment predictive factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Associations of MSI and beta-catenin alterations with other investigative and clinicopathological factors were in line with the expected </plain></SENT>
