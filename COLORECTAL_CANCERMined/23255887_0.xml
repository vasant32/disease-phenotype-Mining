<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reported DNA methylation in the promoter of APC varies greatly among studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) in different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), also known as IGFBP-related protein 1 (IGFBP-rP1), is expressed in various tissue types, including the lung, brain, prostate and gastrointestinal tract, and has been suggested to play a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor role against colorectal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have indicated that IGFBP7 is inactivated by DNA methylation in human colon, lung and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction to study the methylation status of the APC and IGFBP7 gene promoters in cancerous and paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue to evaluate its impact on clinical factors and association with ethnicity, represented by Swedish and Vietnamese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the distribution of CpG islands and the CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> density of each CpG island in the regions which were the subject of our investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from Swedish patients exhibited a significantly higher frequency of IGFBP7 gene methylation in comparison with that of Vietnamese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significantly higher number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> tissues from Vietnamese individuals showed higher levels of methylation versus the paired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue compared with that of Swedish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When we studied the methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> compared with the matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue in individuals, we found that a significantly higher number of Vietnamese patients had a higher degree of IGFBP7 gene methylation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> versus matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue in comparison with Swedish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that the methylation of the APC and IGFBP7 gene promoter region in cancerous tissue, in combination with the predominance of methylation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue, may serve as a prognostic factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
