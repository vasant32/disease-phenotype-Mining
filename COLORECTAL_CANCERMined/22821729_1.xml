<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although recent studies indicate that DNA methylation contributes to the down-regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), this field remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify methylation-silenced miRNAs and clarify their role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, we performed a microarray analysis and screened for miRNAs that were induced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50131">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</z:chebi> treatment or by the knockdown of DNA methyltransferases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The DNA methylation status of the candidate miRNA was analysed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that miRNA-149 (miR-149) was epigenetically silenced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and down-regulation of miR-149 was associated with hypermethylation of the neighbouring CpG island (CGI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the miR-149 level was markedly reduced in 51.6% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> tissues compared with matched non-cancerous tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, low expression of miR-149 was associated with a greater depth of invasion (p = 0.012), lower 5-year survival rate (p = 0.025), and was found to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (p = 0.016) in a multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transfection of miR-149 inhibited cell growth and invasion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also identified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for Specificity Protein 1 (SP1, Sp1), a potential oncogenic protein, as a target of miR-149 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that, as a methylation-sensitive miRNA, miR-149 may play an important role as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> suppressor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>, which has prognostic and therapeutic implications </plain></SENT>
