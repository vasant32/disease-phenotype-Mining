<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 514 patients living in Madeira, Portugal, was enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Institutional review board approval was obtained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients signed an informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent both CT colonography and optical colonoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT colonography was interpreted by an experienced radiologist at a remote centre using tele-radiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative (NPV) predictive values with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for colorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> ≥6mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 510 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT colonography obtained a per-patient sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and, NPV for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> ≥6mm of 98.11% (88.6-99.9% 95% CI), 90.97% (87.8-93.4% 95% CI), 56.52% (45.8-66.7% 95% CI), 99.75% (98.4-99.9% 95% CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> ≥6mm per-patient sensitivity, specificity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> and, NPV were 100% (86.7-100% 95% CI), 87.07% (83.6-89.9% 95% CI), 34.78% (25.3-45.5% 95% CI) and 100% (98.8-100% 95% CI), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this prospective trial, teleradiology-based CT colonography was accurate to screen a patient cohort of a remote island, at average risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
