<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined alterations in the level of serum anti-p53 antibody(S-p53 Ab) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients who underwent curative resection and analyzed the usefulness of S-p53 Ab as a monitoring marker for postoperative observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurement of S-p53 Ab was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in 16 stage II/III <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients with a high level of S-p53 Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A time course analysis of both S-p53 Ab and CEA levels was performed in 6 of these patients who were carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median S-p53 Ab level was 29.9 U/mL and the half-life of the S-p53 Ab level was 40.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4(25%) cases, the level of S-p53 Ab recovered to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits by 79-142 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the half-lives of S-p53 Ab and CEA were analyzed in 6 patients who were both S-p53 Ab and CEA positive, the half-lives of S-p53 Ab and CEA were 32.3 and 13.2 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the case of recurrence with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastasis</z:e> after resection of ascending <z:hpo ids='HP_0003003'>colon cancer</z:hpo>, the S-p53 Ab level did not respond quickly while the CEA level increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is difficult to use the level of S-p53 Ab as a marker for monitoring treatment, and priority should be given to the examination of CEA and imaging modality </plain></SENT>
