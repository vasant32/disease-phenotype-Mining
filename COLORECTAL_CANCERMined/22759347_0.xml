<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta is the predominant subtype which mediates the biological effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi>, while loss of expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta has been indicated as a common step in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological studies have revealed several functional polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor beta (ESR2) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, but relevant study in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is limited, particularly in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the association of circulating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> and variations of ESR2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We initiated a case-control study consisting of 390 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> and 445 healthy controls in men only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We genotyped ESR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1256049 and rs4986938 and measured serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentration using chemilluminescence immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the associations between these variables and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ESR2 rs1256049 CT/TT genotypes were associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (odds ratio [OR], 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-1.0), while rs4986938 CT/TT genotypes were associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR, 1.5, 95% CI, 1.0-2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk increased with the number of risk genotypes of these two SNPs in a dose-response manner (Ptrend, 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Specifically, subjects carrying risk genotypes of both SNPs had the highest risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR, 2.0, 95% CI, 1.3-3.3.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> concentration alone was associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> in men (OR, 1.2, 95% CI, 1.0-1.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, individuals presenting both rs4986938 CT/TT genotypes and high level of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> had a high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (OR, 2.3, 95% CI, 1.4-3.9), compared with those presenting CC genotype and low level of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23965">estradiol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The similar joint results were not observed for SNP rs1256049 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that endogenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> and genetic variations in ESR2 may individually, or more likely jointly, affect <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> risk in male Han Chinese population, while larger studies are needed to validate our findings </plain></SENT>
