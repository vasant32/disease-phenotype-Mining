<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a potent antitumor effect of a single low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and interleukin-12 (IL-12) gene therapy against advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002672'>gastrointestinal carcinoma</z:hpo>, in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assessed whether the delivery of IL-12 by gene therapy together with metronomic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> exerts antitumor effects in a murine model of colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This combination therapy was able, at least in part, to reverse immunosuppression, by decreasing the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as well as of splenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, metronomic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus IL-12 gene therapy failed to increase the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-infiltrating T lymphocytes and, more importantly, to induce a specific antitumor immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to this, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> at a single low dose displayed a superior anticancer profile than the same drug given at a metronomic schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results may have important implications in the design of new therapeutic strategies against colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in combination with immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
