<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> is a marker of a possible hereditary component in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> is a good marker to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e>, especially retrospectively, and if there is any other feature that could improve this identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> aged 45Â years or younger from the pathological reports of three different institutions and different periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical information, family history, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> samples were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were classified according to mismatch repair (MMR) proficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 133 tumors, 22 showed microsatellite instability (MSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 MSI cases, a germline mutation in 1 of the MMR genes was identified, 7 of which were not identified before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) of right colon <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for a positive genetic MMR test is 30.6%, whereas "signet ring" cells and fulfillment Amsterdam II criteria have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> of 42.9% and 47.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combining right-sided <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> with mucin production, with fulfilling Amsterdam II criteria, or with "signet ring" cells, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPVs</z:chebi> are 54.5, 64.3, and 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of the absence of a mutation when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is located in the left colon is 94.7%, whereas absence of aggregation for Lynch-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> has a 100% probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> is an effective method to identify retrospectively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009405" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Lynch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the location and histology features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and the familial history of the cases, we notably increase the a priori probability of detecting a germline MMR mutation </plain></SENT>
