<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although stromal-cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α is suggested to be involved in tumorigenicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, the clinicopathological significance of its expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined SDF-1α expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> and investigated its relationship to clinicopathological features such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, lymph-node <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, vascular invasion (VI), lymphatic invasion (LI) and neural invasion (NI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Specimens of 83 primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancers</z:e> were examined immunohistochemically, and the relationships between clinicopathological features and SDF-1α expression were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare the expressions between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colon tissue and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> tissues, we performed Western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the Western blot analyses, SDF-1α was more highly expressed in colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colonic mucosa (20/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to the immunohistochemical stain, SDF-1α was associated with nodal status, distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> staging, VI and LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SDF-1α expression had a significant prognostic value for overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier plots of survival in patients with high SDF-1α showed that high SDF-1α expression was associated with a shorter overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no association was found between SDF-1α expression and other pathologic or clinical variables, including age, gender, degree of differentiation, and presence of perineural invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of SDF-1α might be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of SDF-1α could be a therapeutic option in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
