<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms of cell cycle modulation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is necessary to define the mode of action of satraplatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate the ability of satraplatin to induce cell cycle perturbation, clonogenicity loss and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells were treated with satraplatin, and the effects of satraplatin on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis was used to investigate the effects of satraplatin on cell cycle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-qPCR was used to evaluate p53-related <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> modulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Satraplatin induced an accumulation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells predominantly in the G(2)/M phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased p53 protein expression was observed in the p53 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HCT116 and LoVo cells together with p21(waf1/cip1) protein up-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, p21(waf1/cip1) protein accumulation was not observed in the p53 mutant HCT15, HT29, and WiDr cells, even when p53 protein expression was compromised, suggesting that the cell cycle perturbation is p53-p21(waf1/cip1) independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following a candidate approach, we found an elevated expression of 14-3-3σ protein levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, which was independent of the status of p53, further supporting the role of satraplatin in the perturbation of the G(2)/M cell cycle phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, satraplatin treatment induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> along with Bcl-2 protein down-regulation and abrogated the clonogenic formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest that satraplatin induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> cells, which is preceded by cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M due to the effect of 14-3-3σ and in a p53-p21(waf1/cip1)-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings highlight the potential use of satraplatin for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
