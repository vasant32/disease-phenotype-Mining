<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fragment C γ receptor (FcγR) polymorphisms may predict the effectiveness of cetuximab, but this has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the clinical relevance of FcγR gene polymorphisms and KRAS status in iri-notecan-refractory mCRC patients treated with cetuximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The total number of irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients studied was 118 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, 117 and 107 patients were screened for KRAS mutations and genetic polymorphisms of FcγRIIa-131H/R and FcγRIIIa-158V/F, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of FcγR polymorphisms and KRAS mutations with clinical outcome was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KRAS mutations were found in 33 patients (27.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> KRAS was associated with a better response rate (p &lt; 0.001), longer progression-free survival (p &lt; 0.001) and longer overall survival (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FcγRIIa H/H, H/R and R/R polymorphisms were observed in 54, 49 and 4 patients, respectively, and FcγRIIIa V/V, V/F and F/F polymorphisms were observed in 6, 65, and 36 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were not significantly associated with either FcγRIIa or FcγRIIIa polymorphisms or with combinations of KRAS status and FcγR polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa polymorphisms may not be useful molecular biomarkers for the activity of cetuximab in patients with mCRC </plain></SENT>
