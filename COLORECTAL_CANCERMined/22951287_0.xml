<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TAS-102-a novel oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> antitumour agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 25, 2009, and April 12, 2010, we undertook a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients were 20 years or older; had confirmed colorectal <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp>; had a treatment history of two or more regimens of standard chemotherapy; and were refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31941">oxaliplatin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients had to be able to take oral drugs; have measurable lesions; have an Eastern Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Group performance status of between 0 and 2; and have adequate bone-marrow, hepatic, and renal functions within 7 days of enrolment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either TAS-102 (35 mg/m(2) given orally twice a day in a 28-day cycle [2-week cycle of 5 days of treatment followed by a 2-day rest period, and then a 14-day rest period]) or placebo; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients received best supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Randomisation was done with minimisation methods, with performance status as the allocation factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The randomisation sequence was generated with a validated computer system by an independent team from the trial sponsor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Investigators, patients, data analysts, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Safety analyses were done in the per-protocol population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study is in progress and is registered with Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-090880 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: 112 patients allocated to TAS-102 and 57 allocated to placebo made up the intention-to-treat population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 11·3 months (IQR 10·7-14·0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival was 9·0 months (95% CI 7·3-11·3) in the TAS-102 group and 6·6 months (4·9-8·0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 0��56, 80% CI 0·44-0·71, 95% CI 0·39-0·81; p=0·0011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>57 (50%) of 113 patients given TAS-102 in the safety population had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of grade 3 or 4, 32 (28%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, and 19 (17%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No patient given placebo had grade 3 or worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>; three (5%) of 57 had grade 3 or worse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Serious adverse events occurred in 21 (19%) patients in the TAS-102 group and in five (9%) in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: TAS-102 has promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948380" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">metastatic colorectal cancer</z:e> who are refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
